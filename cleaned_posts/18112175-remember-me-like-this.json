received this as an advanced reader copy i loved the plot character development and overall story line i'd recommend this as a beach read as it is fast paced and captivating","2":"i just couldn't get into it perhaps others might but for me it was just not engaging","3":"beautifully written what happens when loving parents experience their worst fear bret anthony johnston has written a moving novel about a family's reaction to such an event and its aftermath","4":"loved it made me feel all the feels and the writing was beautiful great characters more meaty than the plot heavy book i was expecting and it was a great surprise the book ended wonderfully but the epilogue seemed unnecessary","5":"because he'd acknowledged that there was something to acknowledge and they could no longer pretend otherwise because they couldn't snuff out this new life with silence and they couldn't call back who they'd been by avoiding who they were now this book was graceful heart wrenching and deeply honest highly recommend","6":"it's funny i see many people wanting to see more of what happened to justin which isn't a spoiler but in a way i could have done without dwight in the story i cared much more about the family than about the plotline the characters were nutrition enough for this book to keep me going slightly overwritten in places but nonetheless beautiful","7":" this book makes you think you're about to embark on a fairly standard thriller but then you are drawn into a happy family that has had something terrible happen to it all of the main characters but one are laid bare in the point of view telling and you learn to care deeply about flawed but normal people who never asked to be thrown into the limelight well paced and plotted with an edge but i didn't want to devour it i wanted to savor it highly recommended the author is young and this is his first novel i can't wait for the next one a truly american book the setting the weather the language really loved it","8":"superbly written not an unnecessary word strong sense of place","9":"four years have passed since the disappearance of eleven year old justin campbell his parents eric and laura and his younger brother griff have never stopped hoping he was alive their life has been in limbo ever since his room is a shrine filled with the christmas and birthday presents he missed his mother even buys new clothes for him in the appropriate sizes so when he returns it will be like he's never been gone then unexpectedly justin is found alive living with a man a few miles away he returns home and this seems like the start of the happy ending the author then tells the story of the next several months from several perspectives but never justin's the gaps in our knowledge about justin's mindset generate a lot of tension as we observe how his parents and others adapt to his reappearance the author never depicts the events of the abduction or what happened to justin but we get some clues throughout the book i was just fine with this since i believe i already know more than i care to about child abduction from numerous other books as well as countless episodes of criminal minds this isn't a typical psychological thriller about the apprehension and or prosecution of a criminal i thought it was a tremendously gripping and complex portrayal of a family struggling to put their life back together again after horrific events i thought the characters were vulnerable and flawed and the story was beautifully written in a way that kept you from putting it down until you reached the end i believe this is the author's first novel aside from a collection of short stories i'll definitely be looking forward to his next work","10":" this novel is about a family whose child has been missing for four years only it's told from a new and different perspective than what one might be used to while most books that deal with this sort of storyline focus just on what happens after the child goes missing and how the family deals with it this book goes beyond the missing part and is more about what happens after the missing child who has been kidnapped is actually found how does the family put the pieces back together when each individual may be irrevocably broken touching heartbreaking and realistically raw this story has it all i won this arc edition in a goodreads first reads giveaway listed by selby mccrae marketing department at random house thank you goodreads selby and random house for the opportunity to read and review this book","11":"i seem to have read a few books lately quite unintentionally that deal with the after effects of trauma there are two that i have strong recollection of the first was an untamed state i remember this book because of the character mireille's struggle to live her life following being kidnapped and tortured this book was memorable because of the distressing and i believe at times unnecessary descriptions of torture another was ronan's echo this stood out to me because of the after effects of trauma for a soldier following ww1 and the impact this had on his family i remember this so strongly because the horror of the war was equalled by the horror of what soldiers and their families dealt with when they returned home this book remember me like this follows a teenager and his family following the teenager returning home some years after being abducted we are never really told the horrors this young man faced those it is alluded to that he had been a sexually abused regularly by his abductor this book attempts to show what the return home is like for this young man and his family what are the issues they face and how do they cope with those things the two books i mentioned above are loud in your face books there is no mistaking the trauma experienced by the characters or the struggles those characters have by contrast this is a quiet novel with much left unsaid the author is subtle and nuanced in his approach i like the idea of what the author was aiming for but he was too subtle and too nuanced and i fear his book lost power and impact on his audience because of that i love a book that shows not tells and the author has worked really hard here to do that we're never told what characters thinks and feel and instead the author shows us their behaviours and how they react to things again a little too subtle and a little too nuanced with the main character seeming to have sailed through his ordeal with no significant effects at all i know this isn't the message the author was aiming for but there you have it one of the problems i suspect is that we are used to seeing characters who have experienced trauma externalise but this character internalises it's important to realise that not everyone reacts to trauma the same way but i believe we needed to see inside the character's head to understand and empathise 'it's old skin she's getting ready to shed she can hardly see through it right now she's really scared' 'that sucks ''it really does ' justin said 'she can't see that i'm the one holding her she doesn't know who i am she doesn't think she's anywhere close to safe ' this was a nicely written book and the author has skill in writing lovely prose but the book was too slow for me to love it","12":"i loved the characters especially the grandfather and it was far less harrowing than i'd feared","13":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was reluctant to open up bret anthony's mystery novel remember me like this both my mom and sister told me to read it so i pushed myself to venture out of my bias towards mystery novels the book is about a family whose son is kidnapped unlike many realistic kidnappings justin is found four years after his abduction the main plot of the book revolves around the reunification of this broken family needless to say four years of loss and hopelessness are not easy to forget and the wounds i was reluctant to open up bret anthony's mystery novel remember me like this both my mom and sister told me to read it so i pushed myself to venture out of my bias towards mystery novels the book is about a family whose son is kidnapped unlike many realistic kidnappings justin is found four years after his abduction the main plot of the book revolves around the reunification of this broken family needless to say four years of loss and hopelessness are not easy to forget and the wounds of the family do not heal quickly or ever at all the first part of this book pulled me into the story and entertained me through various conflicts and discoveries yet the book failed to engage me as it dragged on to the second half i thought that the second half was not needed if the goal of the story was to describe how a family heals after reunited post kidnapping narrated between every family member but justin the boy abducted multiple pov chapters make the book more interesting i found it both annoying and beneficial by not telling justin's story directly throughout the novel the reader is left in the dark about justin's mysterious abductor and what happened in those four years however it added to the suspense because i was hungry for more details overall this book might not have been my first choice but i'm glad i read it because it was interesting to see the campbell family's emotional healing or lack of it more","14":"an original twist on the impact of a child gone missing on a family page turning goodness","15":" i just didn't connect with this book i found it a bit of a slog to read through the only real action or conflict occurs in the last few chapters and then it turns out to be a bust the first chapter is fast paced and intriguing but then i spent the next 300 pages wondering if they accidentally pulled that chapter from a different book i felt like the whole story was in slow motion i know that's appealing to some people as if somehow forcing you to pay attention to minutiae makes a more nuanced story but i don't subscribe to that if you do this is the book for you","16":"4 5 stars i really enjoyed this book was very well written and kept my interest","17":"this book is excellent it's perfectly paced and incredibly nuanced it's not a thriller or mystery but it reads like one it's a story about a family struggling to cope with the aftermath of a traumatic event and how much you really know your loved ones i could not put it down and highly recommend it","18":" loved this dissection of an american family in the aftermath of a tragedy and how each member copes or doesn't with it i think the characters were so strong it was like i was living this story through them i knew how each of them thought felt existed the way johnston handled the thought provoking experience of losing and finding a child was really expertly done i couldn't stop the story from running in my head and i expect to continue to think about it for a while i was surprised and extremely impressed with how this novel ended really really liked it","19":"interesting idea of what happens when a missing child is reunited with his family but felt it could have benefited from some editing","20":" the hook have you ever played that trust game called fall back you know the one where you fall backwards into empty space and trust that someone will catch you or you could say \"has your back\" that's how i felt when i chose remember me like this two of my trusted friends jill s u0026amp elyse w both raved so much about this that i had faith they wouldn't drop me into the pages of a book that was not good the line - \"when she'd last seen justin girls were strange prissy creatures to be avoided--a flash of memory hadn't he one evening asked her to marry him --so the fact that he'd returned having had a girlfriend was the sorriest most irrefutable proof of how long he'd been gone \"the sinker - i'd consider remember me like this to be one of the most real fiction books i've ever read many books have explored the theme and horror of a missing child few have done it as well as bret anthony johnston if i hadn't known he was a man i'd have thought he was a woman as he captured the emotion and deep pain of the mother of the missing teen while not losing the torment helplessness or guilt felt by justin's father brother and grandfather there you have it simple yet so complex justin campbell disappears from his coastal texas town as you'd expect everyone rallies parents friends police and townspeople search for the missing youth as time passes it's difficult to keep the momentum up but his parents eric and laura do their best to keep justin's photo and case in people's minds when they receive a postcard in justin's writing telling them don't stop looking\"it strengthen their belief their son is alive then one afternoon the impossible happens \" four years had gone by four years of searching of wondering of spiraling hope of prayers of tears of the most agonizing pain one could bear justin's return seems a miracle a cause for joy and it is but it is also a time of questions struggle guilt love hate a myriad of emotional fervor as this family tries to heal johnston has bared a family's soul in every way you can imagine in this excruciatingly written tightly plotted book it is difficult not to share any passages confirming the truth of the excellence of johnston's writing fall back trust me i'll catch you","21":" this novel is worthy of the press it's gotten i like that johnston came up with an interesting idea we all hear of missing children and the press makes a huge story about them being found what we don't hear about is how the abduction affects the family and friends nor do we hear about how the child feels after being found this is a gritty novel exposing the horror that families go through the guilt anger frustration fear helplessness and isolation the guilt of the parents and the guilt of the survivor especially when sexual abuse is involved is horrific this is a page turner about an ugly subject and the abduction is only half of it if there is a trial involved the trial is akin to reliving the whole thing and needing to justify being a victim as a parent i understood the parent's feeling and had empathy of the children in the book this is realistic fiction at it's finest for me the ending was a bit off while everything else was mesmerizing","22":"johnston reveals the face of a family's worst terror in unique lyrical detail never have i read the account of a young boy's four year nightmare with a pedophile monster told from the point of view of his devastated family before usually author's rely on all the perverted sexual details to lure their audience into the story only a few sentences from a minor character reveal any of the lurid detail instead the author focuses on the lives of the family left behind searching fruitlessly for their son and brother the psychological insights into each of their eroding tortured minds captures the reader with details that sound honest true and lyrical","23":"a nicely written look at the different ways family members respond to a kidnapping","24":"i am having a hard time reviewing this book the story is not an easy one justin campbell goes missing at eleven years old and is found at 15 how he and his family go from there is the story while i did find myself absorbed in the story too much was left out to feel any depth of emotion if the suspense of how it all turns out is enough for you the reader than i would recommend this book","25":"what an amazing story this is no cliched ripped from the headlines kidnapping horror story remember me like this focuses on the family dynamic and how it changes in the absence and then return of a beloved son the plot is interesting and engaging and the characters are so fully developed you'll feel like you're a watching a movie within the words the city of corpus christi also takes on a life of its own and should be considered a character as well this is truly a beautifully written book and a story that will leave you thinking about it for days after johnston is first and foremost a storyteller and that is more than clear in this achievement of a novel you will absolutely not regret reading this story and adding it to the collection of favorites on your bookshelves already can't wait for his next book","26":"this would be called chick lit if it were written by a woman anyway it wasn't worth the read you don't really know what actually happened to justin and everyone else's pov except maybe the brother's was just dull i don't recommend it","27":"started off great but kind of lost me i wanted too hear justin's story","28":"i dithered i almost gave this book 4 stars because i didn't relate to all the authorial choices but in the end the hypnotic grief and tellingly detailed prose won out what an interesting book what interesting choices what sadness what hope what hope","29":"realistic intriguing and sometimes difficult to read about unhappiness and depression read it straight through and it will keep me thinking for awhile","30":"eric and laura have been waiting for 4 years for news of their kidnapped son justin and when they get a call from the police asking them to get to the station right away they assume the worst when they realize that their son is alive and has been in nearby corpus christie the entire time they momentarily believe that the nightmare of the last 4 years is over it doesn't take long for them to realize that life may never get back to the way it was it helps that the kidnapper is in prison but when he is allowed to post bail the family begins to fall apart again strangely justin seems to be the strongest out of all of them or perhaps his little brother griff with the kidnapper planning to plead not guilty a lengthy and ugly trial could be ahead of them justin will have to relive what was done to him his father and his grandfather however have a plan i am the mother of two boys and the things that happen in this book are literally my worst nightmare it would be extremely difficult for me to sit by and wait for the law to punish a person guilty of abusing my child this book made me realize how much more it would damage my children if one of their parents decided to take the law into their own hands while i understood the desire to kill the man i also knew that it would only destroy the family further as unlikely as it seems this book has a hopeful and very nearly happy ending bret anthony johnston has done a wonderful job with these characters even the minor characters have a depth to them that make them so real his writing the pacing everything about this book is expertly crafted","31":"this book was told from everyone else's perspective except for the kidnapped victim he would open up to his brother about a few things but we know nothing about how he's really feeling the book was interesting but i felt it lacked the depth and substance i was looking for if you asked me if you should read it i would tell you that the book was ok just don't expect a lot","32":"i loved this book","33":"at times i loved this book and at other times i wanted more i was really into the father character the older man but sometimes i had trouble relating to the others","34":"in bret anthony johnston's remove t from first name and insert in last remember me like this is a storytelling triumph of an ultimate master finding the depths of character and plot reading his book is akin to taking an expensive tiny swiss mechanical forget the new stuff watch you pry off the back to see the working parts inside the steam punk gears and springs take your breath away yet the masterpiece is working barely something is wrong you begin by inspecting it you lift it you turn it you angle it you peer into the visible parts and gasp all that in that tiny little watch someone invented that someone designed that someone made that bret's fictional family is like that it looks intact they crank out the time but beneath the visible gears and springs it's not right the mother is an emotional wreck aiding a dolphin at a sanctuary the father is having an affair the younger son buries himself in his brother's passion skateboarding and lives under overwhelming guilt for no reason then the older brother is found and returned to them in what appears to be fairly normal condition the pedophile is arrested happy ending yeah right the pedophile is released because his mother is dying of cancer and returns to the same small community spoiler alert the pedophile is killed in fact bret overshadows the entire work with an opening future scene of a washed up body and then returns to the earlier story see bret i did learn something about plot structure in the work bret finds depth in each character's heart line walking with pain hand and hand with each as s he finds her his way to some form of normalcy he guides the reader to surgically remove the complicated master timepiece parts to reveal the gears beneath the gears to inspect what can not be seen he invites the reader to inspect how they interlock and click to make a family you find not one dysfunction but many most of the book you worry who the sea bloated body is spoiler alert then he ultimately leaves you with the mystery of who killed the pedophile and if you can believe it it doesn't matter as a reader you can't find all the answers on first read or i couldn't instead they creep into my consciousness at night where is the incongruity why is there a little girl outside the classroom why does she have a gun gun in act i you'd better use it by act iii worries why is it reported as if it were an every day event it's my mind that added the ba dump ba back to the fine timepiece that now is in pieces on the work table under the fluorescent light where is the incongruity it's been dangling there for a few days now and i'm still puzzling it out tearing it apart with surgical care to find my answers i seek the incongruous what did bret offer us to learn from this novel why the dolphin inclusion because it allowed the story of how a dolphin community will save a young or ill member but lifting them to the surface to breathe sometimes for days it takes the community working together to survive others step forward for me this is the heart of bret's tale the father is buoyed by an affair once he is healing the affair falls away she always knew he would leave but she was there lifting him in his misery to the mother the dolphin center in a larger city where she volunteers under anonymity offers her safe respite and the small community where she lives accepts her out of sanity moments when she breaks down in public to the younger brother skateboarding and a new girlfriend offer him solace the victim who was terrified of snakes returns to his family with one he's befriended incongruity he is identified by a woman who sold him mice to feed his snake at a crucial returning to some sense of normality transition point for the victim the snake is shedding her skin and is blind and vulnerable ready to strike back seek the incongruity within the intricate clockworks and attempt to put it back together again in writing you don't need to show them all but know they are working properly out of sight but remember the saying first rule of tinkering save all the parts bret saves all the parts and leaves them carefully in place still remaining on my worktable and not yet inserted the dog what's under that house i'm eerily worried that i'm not going to like the answer to that it will remain a mystery maybe because i'm not ready to insert it because of the consequences a book after all is now mine to do with what i want bret's job is done on the other hand i read and dissect to learn seek depth not length","35":"johnston is an excellent writer drawing distinct and compelling characters and vivid scenes with sometimes surprising emotional intensity my argument with the book lies in the last fifty pages the drama at the end feels false and tacked on and in conflict with the story that preceded it","36":" wow what can i say about this book that hasn't already been said remember me like this is about what a family goes through once their son is found after being kidnapped 4 years prior this book is emotional and suspenseful after the first few pages i was hooked i enjoyed mr johnston's writing style it was easy to read and hard to put down the struggles they face their love for each other is believable i felt so many emotions while reading this book surprise happiness sympathy sadness even anger at the actions of a character or two very well written the only negative i have coming away from this book is a scene near the end of the book with the younger son i don't fully understand how it fits into the story and could have easily been left out but even with that i loved it and would recommend it and have already to anyone","37":"apparently texans say do what now when they didn't quite catch what someone said","38":"johnston's short story collection named after its corpus christi setting is still the book you should check out this debut novel repeats similar great writing about the alluring area yet comes across too melodramatic at times as it tries to navigate very sensitive material a few of the characters needed a jump start too as though a spark of unpredictability was needed the constant response of sick doesn't help endear any characters to me either realists be damned","39":"an excruciatingly slow read this book is like 95% description and 5% plot basically nothing happens beyond what's in the synopsis the characters are okay but not charismatic enough to make up for the lack of plot i stuck with it because the very start of the book teased something dramatic but that turned out to be not so dramatic at all in the end very disappointing not recommended","40":"i was totally caught up in this book both the story and the writing you do not get all your questions answered but johnston goes straight into the hidden desires and struggles of one american family who is faced with coming to grips with normal abnormal and their own personal reactions i love how he shows the ways we see the world from our own limited perspective taking responsbility for actions and events we don't cause beautiful writing","41":"it followed a family after a missing child comes home it brought to light a lot of psychological issues the whole family would face i liked it","42":"very disappointing good characterizations of main characters especially mother and father minus any real description of or introspection from the principal character the boy who had been kidnapped i kept waiting for a good resolution or denouement but got a totally superficial and weak ending","43":"i was surprised to find that it only took me two weeks to read this book it felt like i was reading it for a long time it started out good and promising raising questions that i was anxious to have answered when i reached part 3 i thought that finally the answers would come by part 4 i began to realize they never would","44":"uplifting and depressing i cried during this book as a parent it's reading about one of my worst nightmares because of that i didn't enjoy this book it was just too real","45":" fascinating portrayal of what we think of as the perfect ending of a kidnapping the child is returned to his family question becomes how does the family adjust to having the victim returned after several years of absence as hard as adjusting to his being missing the rest of the family continue to have issues now that he is found justin also must adjust forgiving his parents for not finding him sooner accepting the sexual abuse he suffered i certainly could empathize with both parents and relate to the ways they used to cope however it did seem that they needed to have monitored their younger son's relationships more closely","46":"well crafted beautifully woven tale heartbreaking and uplifting all the same","47":" good read the premise of the story is amazing i was a little bothered that for a story that should be pretty emotional and riveting i never felt riveted or emotional i can't quite put my finger on it but i felt like everyone was just a little blase on justin coming home let's all act normal never ask questions etc i get being that way when he first got home but i guess i expected it to unfold more as the story went on and the ending wrapped up perfectly neat it was a great story that i just wanted to keep getting deeper and it never really did for me","48":"though i found the characters interesting there were too many holes and disconnected threads in the story line for me to recommend it","49":" i really liked this book i read o'nan's book song of the missing which was about what a family and town goes through when their daughter goes missing but this book took the other side what happens when the missing comes home in a movie it's all he comes home curtain closed but it's not like that so at times yes the book ran slow and it was hard to read but because it's hard to imagine losing a child and more hard to imagine how your family will be changed upon that childs return how do you act what do you ask wanting to be walking on a cloud but also on pins and needles at the same time how do they become a family again this author tackled this eloquently and bravely","50":"after thinking on this overnight i dropped my score down now i did enjoy it and it kept me reading and putting off doing what i should have been doing but there are holes to the story i let those go at the time because i wanted to see where he was going with the story on the whole it is good and i like his writing style and will read more of his stories but i'm dropping my rating down to 3 5","51":"i couldn't put down this book it's more than a story about a child being abducted remember that michelle pfeifer movie it's different from that early in the book you find out what happens to the missing boy the rest of the book is about what happens afterward so touching loved it","52":" what parent doesn't ever fear that something horrible could happen to his her child when patty hearst and elizabeth smart were kidnapped so many thoughts raced through my head along with who had done it and why i wondered how the parents were surviving these thoughts emerged recently when the three young girls were found in a home where their captor had kept them for years in this powerful searing novel the writer chooses not to enter the mind of the kidnapped and returned teenager instead with his magnificent prose and amazing insight he enters the minds of the family and explores their grief their attempts to reconcile the capture and finally to make sense of the worst torture any parent can feel in so doing the author strips away pretense and focuses on how a family continues to feel and love and hope and dream","53":"what a great book riveting heart stopping skillfully plotted and beautifully written i knew nothing about the plot and so i was fully immersed in the anxiety of the story loved it","54":"this book sneaked up on me the plot was definitely engaging from the beginning but the character's stories and secrets were woven so subtly throughout the narrative that i wanted to go back and read again the personal clues i missed along the way that each of them missed about each other makes me wonder what i am missing about the people i love in my own life","55":"a brilliant beautiful devastating novel that submerged me in the desperate world of these characters so forcefully as if holding my head under water until i was short of breath to prove a point about what fear is about what loss might feel like a masterful piece of writing with vivid and memorable characters will stay with you even after having finished the book their unvarnished observations throughout the story--sometimes so awful and recognizable simultaneously--are those places you will want a highlighter handy","56":"the concept of this book was good but the author used waaaay too many words you had to slog through pages of description that added nothing to the story for that reason i would not be able to recommend it to anyone","57":"i received a free copy of this book through the goodreads first reads program this is an engrossing page turner of a book that is hard to put down it tells the story of a boy who was kidnapped at age 11 the book switches perspective from the parents of the missing boy to his brother to his grandfather and details what they go through while still trying to maintain hope that he will return to them","58":"this is johnston's first novel he wrote two previous short story collections he is the director of creative writing at harvard and his skills don't disappoint these characters are real and the pain they feel and difficulties they face are achingly and realistically described we hear about kidnap victims returning to their families but then what this novel answers that question and gives us hope that the victim and his family can recover though the journey is difficult i look forward to more of his writing","59":"overall i liked this book i came to know and care about all the characters though i found the parents and the grandfather the most interesting there were some intense passages but there were also sections that rambled","60":"remember me like this is a novel about the abduction of justin campbell an 11 year old boy from southport texas bret anthony johnston the author teaches in the bennington writing seminars and is the director of creative writing at harvard honestly if he is as good a teacher as he is a writer students should be clamoring to get into his classes johnston is a master of descriptive writing the setting is rendered in complete detail chockfull of sensory information the interior lives of each of the characters also are fully illuminated -often painfully so the story is told from multiple perspectives justin's mother father brother and grandfather have multiple chapters and i came to empathize with all of them although they are part of a loving family each person feels estranged from the others i don't want to reveal any details about the plot which is engaging and kept me guessing summer is waning but if you are looking for one last summer read this would be an excellent choice","61":"beautifully written agonizing sometimes too claustrophobic","62":"bret anthony johnston's debut novel \"remember me like this \" is not the typical child kidnapping thriller that one might expect it to be at first glance it does share many of the elements of that kind of \"whodunit\" crime novel but its focus is really on the aftermath of the crime rather than on the crime itself the novel evolves into a character driven story that reveals more about the victim's family than it does about the crime or the kidnapper who although eventually identified largely remains a mystery to the reader four years after their son's disappearance the campbells still believe that justin is alive and that he will be returned to them one day his parents grandfather and younger brother each cope with the loss in their own way - some more successfully than others - but none of them are ready to give up hope laura campbell has found temporary peace by immersing herself in volunteer work her husband finds his own in the arms of another woman and young griff spends hours learning the skateboarding skills he had so admired in his older brother - and in wooing his first girlfriend and then corpus christi authorities call to tell them that justin has been found what happens next will reveal more about human nature love vengeance and family dynamics than any of the campbells could have foreseen as they so desperately longed for the return of the missing member of their family bret anthony johnston already a well respected short story writer has written here a remarkable first novel one that explores what ordinary people are capable of doing in the name of protecting those closest to them \"remember me like this\" is a reminder too that behind closed doors things are seldom the way they appear to casual observers life is just not that simple the good guy after all does not always win","63":"outside my area of life experience and therefore unable to decide whether characters realistic or vapid not an appealing subject for further research","64":"kidnapped son returns not the best ending","65":" what happens when your child goes missing eric laura justin and griff lived a good life in texas and then one day justin was gone for four years they searched and searched for him posters were handed out and put up in stores everywhere searches were organized throughout the town and all around the outskirts of town no justin what happens when your child is found this is the story of one family and their personal fear raw emotions of before and after personally i would have liked more about justin but the author delved deep into eric laura and giff more interesting read one story that no one ever wants to live in real life","66":"3 5 star reviewthis book follows the story of one family after their son justin returns home after being kidnapped four years earlier it's a multi perspective book that shows how the family is reacting to justin's return the trauma that happened to him and the years of turmoil that occurred after justin's kidnapping although i did enjoy this book immensely i found parts to be too slow and that the novel had a lot of lose ends that left me feeling like their should be some more closure what i liked about this novel the writing was beautiful especially the character writing the characters were written like actual human beings the author avoided any cliches when it came to writing these characters and instead wrote them as flawed and messy but still admirable to an extent of some the overall premise was very interesting i've read my fair share of books about abduction murder cases and a lot of times it ends either happy or bad with this book we get neither a happy or bad ending instead we get an ending that is real and raw this book also focus on the kidnapping of a young boy which i've hardly ever seen usually books like these seem to have young girls being kidnapped murdered etc the book explores trauma and how trauma can affect the whole family very well and compassionately what i didn't like about this novel this is very slow paced which most of the time i don't mind but with this book i felt that it was too slow at points and wanted the author to get to the point already didn't feel i got any closure from this novel i felt that their was still more to explore with the story and that more ends needed to be tied the dialogue between teenagers seemed really unnatural griff and justin simultaneously seemed to be written with dialogue that was too young and too old for their age group i also felt that some of the slang and overall dialogue between teenagers used was a bit dated i kind of wished the author wrote justin's perspective as well but you know although i did enjoy remember me like this i felt that the book could have offered me a bit more and i craved some more closure and engage in the overall story instead it fell a bit flat for me","67":"ok story but didn't hook me really had to work to finish it had some interesting spots but there was just too much going on yet i didn't care much about most of it","68":"not a typical thriller but i really enjoyed it amazing and very realistic description of characters","69":"this book is a slow burning mystery and some of your questions are never really answered i wouldn't call it a thriller but it seems so realistic in how a family might deal with a missing child and his return which means it captures even the mundane moments of daily life","70":"i received an arc of remember me like this from goodreads first reads giveaway i found the novel gripping and compelling the opening had me thinking it was going to end one way and the duration kept me guessing and not wanting to put it down i really liked getting a feel for how each member of the family was coping and processing in their own way this will be a book that i'll think about down the line find myself wondering about the family beyond the conclusion and hoping they've been able to reach a good peaceful place in their lives together","71":" the beginning of this book introduces us to the campbell family four years after justin has been kidnapped the book is told from multiple perspectives and we see how losing him has adversely affected each member of his family then a miracle happens justin is found incredibly well written family drama that focuses on the effects a trauma like this can have on the family the writing style made me feel a bit like a fly on the wall observing this family as they get to know each other again and reclaim their lives while dealing with a myriad of emotions due to all that has happened the characters are flawed but seemed incredibly real so it was easy to care about this family there was one plot development that i found far fetched view spoiler the kidnapper gets out on bail i can't imagine this happening hide spoiler but overall it's a very good story that i would recommend i won this book in a goodreads giveaway and look forward to reading more of this author's work","72":"it was slow and i found myself skimming without really missing anything","73":"so i'm torn on this one it definitely pulled me along with a very suspenseful story that made me want to keep reading to the end but along the way there were moments when i felt manipulated and by the end well ... blah a good story to read that left me empty at the end","74":"its good but i didn't find it as gripping as i thought i would missing children hits home with any parent but somehow i didn't really relate to the characters","75":"practically perfect it was difficult to put down once started","76":"johnston writes with real beauty and with a depth that makes you think about this novel long after it's back on the shelf while he tackles an absolutely enormous subject he handles the unfolding with such grace and respect that in the end the whole thing is oddly inspirational","77":"4 75 stars for a beautifully written story nearly perfect for me except for the occasional excessive details that wore a little thin at times highly recommend","78":"this is really a 3 5 star book a little more editing and it would have hit 4 sometimes i couldn't put it down other times it wandered","79":"a gripping family drama about the aftermath of the return to his family of a teenager who was kidnapped four years prior the book explores the effect his kidnapping and then return has on each of the family members and the relationships between them i thought the premise was great but i never felt any empathy for the characters i found it frustrating that there were whole chunks of context missing that might have enhanced the story a good easy and entertaining read though","80":"i had never heard of author bret anthony johnston before this book but after reading remember me like this i shall certainly be keeping my eye out for any of his other work a novel about family dynamics before and after a missing abducted son is found and reunited with his family johnston's writing is wonderful smooth as silk and you just read page after page without realizing how the hours have passed justin's parents have been understandably leading rather hollow lives since their son went missing trying to deal with everyday life meanwhile younger brother griff is growing up discovering love and trying to cope with his own guilt about the day justin went missing as justin tries to return to a normal life he doesn't give much away about what has happened to him in the four years he has been missing and pleasingly the author manages to tell the story without the gratuitous intimate details of what justin went through with his abductor but even though justin seems to be slotting back into the family okay around him everyone is not coping as well as they themselves expected this is a really good book with outstanding writing my thanks to hatchette books and the reading room for my copy","81":"i thought this book would be really good the description sounded like a book i would enjoy a page turner well i couldn't turn the pages fast enough to be done with it i know it had really good reviews i really wanted to like it but it never happened for me after they found justin the story dragged on and on","82":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here abandoned midway","83":"i couldn't stop questioning myself throughout this read would i lose myself would i disassociate from my family would i give up hope would i think the worst would i even leave the house if my child went missing what if i was left in a state of not knowing would i continue to hold on to the belief that he could be out there i couldn't answer any of these questions and then if he were returned to me would i be able to forget the things that happened would i go after the person that hurt my child would i know how to heal my family could i put the pieces back together of myself and my family could we heal this book cut to the core of how you can feel alone within your family despite sharing a living space and experiences for years it shows how families can heal each other and inspire hope but also question who and how much you trust","84":"a beautiful and emotionally difficult book i cared deeply for all the characters","85":"almost a 4 star focuses on family upon return of missing child","86":" i would like to give this 3 1 2 but goodreads doesnt do half stars i liked this story of a lost child being found and having to acclimate to his world again but there were too many weird little side plots that i felt didnt lend themselves to the story i liked the character of cecil until the end hated the character of eric too wishy washy i think the author left it wide open for a sequel and thats good we dont really know how justin ends up or if he's okay i guess we just have to assume he is at least until the next book comes out","87":"i'd give it 4 5 if i could i had trouble with the beginning but then really got into it and flew through it generally didn't understand the last chapter which left a slightly ick taste in my mouth but still such a great read overall","88":"i had the peculiar sense of time speeding up then slowing down with this one not quite a thriller for that reason but still compelling haunting","89":"i won this book in one of the goodreads giveaways this is a tough subject matter i thought it was going to go into the horrible details of what happened to him while he was held it didn't it's more about how the family deals with the return of the kidnapped victim it was a pretty good book","90":"pretty good a bit dark and depressing but always an underlayment of family love that grounded the story sometimes that love can turn destructive and the book leaves you hanging until the very end anticipating something awful that is foreshadowed in the very beginning of the book its pretty well written and i flew through it","91":"i was unsure if i would like this book but by the middle it got better and by the end i really liked it","92":"an examination of grief and the ways that a family copes with a horror that cannot be named finished in a single sitting simple sweet and very informative look at family relationships will make you think about your own family and the many ways we all put masks on for each other","93":"this book is beautiful what struck me most was the kindness in all the characters despite the violence and fear at the heart of the book when i read the back i half expected some drug addiction bloodshed raging vengeance instead what i got was kindness and the kind of desolation and loneliness that is often left unexplained in similar stories the last line of the book is devastating it's also an honest loving depiction of one of my favorite places on earth","94":"i'd rate this 4 5 stars in the small town of southport texas the campbells seemed like the perfect family but one afternoon their 11 year old son justin mysteriously disappears four years pass without any tangible clues or any idea what happened to him the uncertainty takes its toll on laura and eric both of whom find very different ways of trying to cope with this loss their younger son griffin who fought with justin earlier in the day he disappeared is also struggling with guilt and uncertainty they still hold out hope that they'll find justin or at least understand what happened and they're not quite ready to move on that was the inconceivable and debilitating shock you could grow accustomed to what had once seemed so miserable and alien you could feel a foreign presence in your body endure the pain and deep threat of it and not notice as it turned to bone after four years of false leads and shaky optimism laura and eric get a call one day from the police justin has been found--alive--in nearby corpus christi and he appears to be fine strangely he had been nearby all along and they never knew it buoyed by this unbelievable turn of events they are excited for their lives to get back to the way they once were yet amidst all the happiness comes uncertainty and fear--can justin cope with what happened to him is he angry at his parents for not being able to find him will he be able to get on with his life and progress normally or will he be damaged by his experiences and how will the rest of them truly be happy and relax knowing that in a split second everything can change really once the worst happens it's always happening it's never not happening bret anthony johnson's remember me like this is a beautifully written moving book about coping with tragedy and coping with happiness how both force us to remain on edge it's a book about whether to face and give voice to our fears or keep them bottled inside it's also a book about the fragility of love and the strength of family and how it forces you to do things you might never imagine i really enjoyed this and thought it was tremendously compelling at times i worried where the book would go but johnson did an excellent job slowly unfolding the plot and getting me fully enmeshed in this family and their story it may be a little difficult for some to read given the subject matter but it's not really a heavy emotional book it's just a pretty excellent one","95":"a good pace i kept wanting to read to the end to find out what happened","96":"i really enjoyed this believable characters fast moving plot 2 thumbs up","97":"this is an elegantly written piece of psychological fiction while it threatens to descend into cliche missing child devastated parents no one will ever be the same the writing is too emotionally astute to allow it while the plot has all the markers of a literary thriller it is the emotional portrait of a struggling family that is most compelling its weakness however is that while the inner life of the parents and brother are keenly explored the emotional world of the main character is left frustratingly under developed a strange choice by author and editors","98":"loved the story of a wounded family desperately trying to recover also like the corpus christi setting","99":"very good storytelling about a family recovering from a kidnapping and how they try to stitch their lives back together","100":"it seems many of the negative reviews of this book wanted more of justin's story but i think it was best left up to the reader's imagination yes it was a depressing book but it was also felt real and raw and exactly how i could imagine it to happen","101":"i was impressed from the start with the attention to detail in the setting of the story the south texas area surrounding corpus christi is perfectly captured down to the most minute detail to the point that i was certain the author had lived there growing up i did add this to the tragic portrayal of the traumatic events and their impact on a family and even a town and i thoroughly was captivated by the book it is not one to necessarily enjoy but it was surely an experience","102":"i won this book from goodreads i'm very picky about books that i pick out for pleasure reading and i don't think that this would have been a first pick for me however after two days of staring at it's cover from where it sat in the floor next to my couch i picked it up and thought i'd casually read a chapter while waiting on dinner to cook thanks to bret anthony johnston dinner almost burned i was hooked from the very beginning as a writer one of the first things i notice when reading a book is the writing style johnston's style reminded me of a mix between gillian flynn and maybe john grisham it's honestly hard to put johnston in a box with other authors that i've read i really liked how well he painted the texas shore town of corpus christi and how he developed the characters i will say that if you read the reviews on goodreads like i did after i read the book you might see some disappointed readers i hate to be one of those people that says well you just didn't get it but in this case i really can't help it if you think that this book is going to give you gory details about the abuse and relationship this missing child had with his captor keep moving don't even waste your time flipping through the pages of this book remember me like this is not a story of abuse and torture ripped from the headlines it will leave you with several questions about justin and what happened to him and if you just have to have a gory detail well johnston does a good job of alluding to what happened towards the end of the book the point of this book is not about justin the missing boy it's not about his time away from his family for four years it's not about what happened to him during those four years it's not even about him when he comes home it's about the lives around him that were affected by his disappearance it's about how his parents' marriage fell apart after he disappeared it's about how his little brother spent four years lying to the police and his parents and blaming himself for his brother being gone it's about his father losing himself in an affair in order to get his mind off of his missing child it's about a grandfather who feels like he's failed his family until i read this book i've honestly never thought about what the families of kidnapped children go through like most people i focus on what the media puts out about the kidnap suspects and the details of what happened to the child and of course i feel happy and excited when a child is actually returned home but i have never once thought about how those families carry on their day to day lives all while wondering where their missing child is i've never once thought about how difficult it might be to adjust to having that child back home until reading remember me like this i always thought that the happy ending was just that happy i never thought that maybe it wasn't that simple a lot of the reviews i've read about this book really ripped it apart because even though johnston gives you the point of view of all of the other family members in justin's life you never get to see his point of view that reason is one of the biggest reasons why i loved this book by focusing on justin and the events surrounding him you lose the point of the story the family they're too scared to ask why he came home with a limp or how he overcame his fear of snakes they don't want to think about what terrible things he might have gone through while he was gone for four years they are scared if they ask him too many questions he might disappear again and that in my opinion is what johnston wants you to feel with this story he wants you to feel like you're walking on eggshells when justin is in the scene he wants you to feel the tension between him and the rest of family he wants you to feel their uneasiness and guilt i highly recommend remember me like this if you are interested in reading a story about the effects having a child kidnapped can leave on parents and their other child and grandparents johnston's writing evokes several emotions all at once that give you that same mixed up feeling that justin's family has while trying to adjust to having someone they missed for four years entering back into their lives his writing gives you that same sick nervousness that his parents walk around with because they once thought that their son might have actually been dead just keep in mind that sometimes a happy ending isn't always happy","103":"4 5 the last 50 pages really got to me atypical take on the kidnapped kid comes home thing vivid scenery and placement","104":"when justin campbell is found four years after his abduction i expected a very different reunion there were tears of course and hugging but the whole ordeal seems rushed there is a strangely optimistic feel with jokes from the recently missing son and a fast settling into a new normal of a normal family without a gaping hole in the portrait i was annoyed i wanted more trauma more heart wrenching details more screaming but i was wrong soon the perfect family portrait grew unsettling as the currents of emotions seemed to sweep this family around out of their control grief trauma and depression none of which disappear instantly stagnate the growth of new relationships and regrowth while blooming love and regained intimacy push them forward the threat of anger and violence simmers beneath every encounter pushing their movement off course and propelling me forward i blew through this novel in less than 24 hours as all of these forces of emotion built and seemed ready to overwhelm the vulnerable campbells i think the unspoken violence is really what builds the most while very few scenes are explicitly recounted it is never quite far justin's treatment at the hands of his abductor laura's near suicide attempts cecil and eric's plan for retribution the distance between each family member knowing that they do not know their innermost thoughts nor what their loved ones are capable of doing the edition i read had alice sebold's take on the back in remember me like this johnston presents an incisive dismantling of an all too comforting fallacy that in being found we are no lost i appreciated this novel's treatment of both violence and healing it's tender dance through the middle ground the questions of 'what can be done' and 'what needs to be done' are well handled especially when the answers are not the same overall a high recommendation from me","105":"gripping story could not put it down","106":"i like the premise for this book and even though i did like the characters i was very frustrated with them i wanted to shake them all and say talk to each other and the ending left me feeling blah that being said i would give it 3 1 2 stars","107":"i've been struggling with how to review this book is it well written yes in fact it's excellently written did i love it not really i liked it a lot but i didn't love it the author digs deep into the emotions of the characters at times i longed for more action but the writing is real and honest you may love it it's definitely worth reading","108":"i was conflicted about my rating compelling story really interesting insight in to the minds of a family after a horrific event somehow i was not engaged and had a hard time finishing the book it dragged a bit for me and i was left without much resolve which does not bother me at all in some books that i read it felt somehow empty","109":"this book captured my interest from the first page it held my interest until the last 40 pages the end just fell flat for me the writing was wonderful while i would have liked justin explored more fully the other characters were completely developed and believable the multiple perspective writing provided the reader with a range of emotions and understanding there were marvelous descriptive paragraphs that enriched the story line other nights they fought they through accusations of surrender and apathy like knives their world was discolored muted perforated by helplessness if cecil wasn't mistaken mullen still had a set of golf clubs in hock at the shop the strange and scattered pieces of ourselves we leave behind cecil thought who could know what would still be in pawn when the world is done with you who could predict the legacy of small lives","110":"this definitely had potential and i liked it at first but i felt it dragged on by the end","111":"a young boy goes missing unbeknownst to everyone abducted after four heart wrenching years of not knowing what has happened to him he is discovered and rescued from his captor and he is reunited with his family the kidnapper is arrested and awaiting his trial the story goes on to tell you how each person is affected the victim his brother mother father and grandfather each member trying desperately to reassemble the broken pieces of their lives","112":"interesting subject matter","113":" bret anthony johnston's first novel is a literary pot boiler of a book a great beach read for thinking people mystery it's there human insight yes drama and intrigue boy howdy sure i could nit pick a few things i can always nit pick a few things like ok mostly i wish the past backed up on justin a little more and i wish the mom's character had a little more substance but screw nit picking because the bottom line is i didn't want to put the book down johnston structured the book to keep the reader turning the pages and he succeeds i could read griff and cecil all day long i ran out of pages of them way before i ran out of love for them also rainbow is a wonderful addition to the literary dogs of the world i'll be keeping my eye out for johnston's next novel the premise for this debut is amazing and no one writes their way into a character's head better than johnston i can't wait to see what he comes up with to follow it up","114":"3 5 close to 4 but just not quite i understand why the author did not include sordid details but it would have been more gripping if there was more info on what happened to justin during his 4 years of captivity really good writing makes me want to visit corpus christie which must make it phenomenally good writing because i am sure after my 4 years in texas that it ain't that great","115":" where has bret anthony johnston the author of this book been why was his name unfamiliar his writing is so excellent this book probably deserves a five star rating so here's a prediction johnston will be well known soon in spite of that in the end remember me like this gets four not five stars although the detailed view of each main character is really necessary to this story and johnston's descriptions are perfect it seems that he could have added more suspense by concentrating earlier on eric's and cecil's plans and maybe he could have elaborated on jason's nightly drives which most fathers would have caught on to after the first night but this is an author you want to read his writing is so good he'll make you want to reread paragraphs i won an arc of this book through librarything com","116":"i'd like to give this 3 5 stars it started out really strong fast paced suspenseful a page turner but fizzled out toward the end i would have liked to know more about justin's experience and found the brother's romantic relationship to be an unnecessary addition good book though that i was glad to read because it made me enthralled in a book again after spending a couple of months slogging through a book i couldn't get into and ultimately set aside","117":"best book i've read in a long time loved the way the author didn't make the obvious choices in writing this story highly recommend","118":"a bit slow at times but thoughtful and sincere satisfying","119":" this book was actually nothing like i thought it was going to be it tells the story of justin who is an eleven year old boy who is abducted in a small town in southern texas his family is torn apart and continues searching every day for him four years later he is found unharmed in a town several miles away while i though this book was going to be the story of their happy ending after justin was found it is the exact opposite it deals with each member of the family and how they are dealing with justin's return each character deals with justin's return differently and this novel tells the story of how the family must work together to overcome their hurt overall i really enjoyed this mystery and would read from this author again free copy provided by net galley in exchange for an honest review","120":"wow beautifully written","121":" over the course of a fiercely hot texan summer the five members of the campbell family struggle to rediscover ordinary life for mum laura father eric grandpa cecil and brother griff it's as if their prayers have been answered justin the teenage boy abducted four years earlier has been found but change however much desired requires a challenging adjustment will they ever be an ordinary family again i found this an extremely poignant return to the territory of abduction as portrayed in pretty is and the girl in the red coat and family divided by grief like everything i never told you and a song for issy bradley as the members tiptoe around each other in an attempt to ease each other's pain the slow pace allows for evocative description and emotional depth for example p211 the past was a bridge that looked solid and sturdy but once you were on it you saw that it extended only far enough to strand you to suspend full review http annegoodwin weebly com annecdo","122":"good book based in texas coast area sad at times but good","123":"i would give this book 3 5 stars if that were possible it was a page turner as the reader waits to find out whose body is floating in the water at the beginning of the book the mental anguish of the family members mom dad younger brother grandfather was told from the perspective of each and was gripping however as another reviewer pointed out we never find out what happened to justin in the 4 years he was missing nor do we get his perspective on his experiences i will look for other novels by johnston he's a good story teller","124":"after being abducted the campbell's son justin is found and returns home after four years while freshman author johnston gives us a brief account of the kidnapping and a bit of what happened during his ordeal for the most part this isn't a story about justin's years away more it's about how he and his family can reconnect after those years apart we all change as the years pass certainly as such young impressionable children how will he integrate back into the family he knew will they be able to adjust to the person he's become as the victim of such a heinous crime these are all things johnston walks us through beautifully one family member at a time the ending was not something i saw coming and frankly not one i particularly cared for but hey it made me think and that's pretty sweet i look forward to johnston's next work and think he set the bar well above the rest of his fellow novice peers i received this arc in exchange for an honest review","125":"what a beautiful storyteller if you like descriptive language and deep character development this is for you the novel surrounds a kidnapping but doesn't focus on the grisly details but the aftermath for the kidnapped boy and his family excellent","126":"remember me like this is a novel that will suck you in and leave you gasping for air it is a complex story with complex characters each unfolding further as the tale progresses it is a story of tragedy hope despair family and the myriad of facets to each member and the challenges they face when the worst of the worst happens the author does a fantastic job of bringing these people to you to your home they are your neighbors they are your family take a weekend take a vacation day do whatever you need to in order to get through this but mostly take a very deep breath before you start it's going to have to last you awhile","127":"very disappointing read","128":"excellent premise but the execution didn't work for me i would have preferred if the author chose one or maybe two characters to focus the narrative on instead of jumping between five characters","129":"i didn't finish this the storyline was too dark for me","130":"i loved this book and the family in the story it showed how families can be dysfunctional but still love each other and struggle for what is best for each person it was very moving to me","131":"justin was just 12 years old the day he went missing and 4 years later his family is still searching for any sign of him this may sound like the opening of a review for a mystery or thriller but it's really the story of what happens to all the members of a family when a child goes missing there were a few times when i thought the story would fall into easy cliches or merry mix ups but each time johnston skillfully put the book back on track as in real life there is no easy resolution here as the family picks up the pieces of their life and tries to move forward i wish i could give half stars because this is really a 3 5 star read","132":"well written nuanced gripping read but it falls apart at the end contrived","133":"never loses the pace fleshed out characters believable characters and storyline look forward to more from this author easily in my top 10 of 2014","134":" too often novels read as though authors imagine complex topics demand florid even labyrinthine sentences perhaps they see proust's magisterial-and mammoth -examination of sense and memory in search of lost time as their touchstone yet one mark of a gifted storyteller can also beto distill complex often imponderable topics into a draught of clean clear prose indeed that's the sensation one returns to again and again and always with admiration when carried away by brett anthony johnston's mediation on love and the unhealed wounds of loss in his long awaited debut novel remember me like this readers unfamiliar with johnston's previous work may know him by reputation his collection of short stories corpus christi won wide recognition his work has appeared in a range of journals as well as several editions of best american short stories many writers treasure naming the world an anthology of essays on writing and exercises by famous authors--edited by johnston fans may feel some trepidation at his long form debut many a fine short storyist has wiped out when first trying to ollie the novel johnston however doesn't just clear the novel he soars given the opening and subject matter-a body discovered floating in corpus christi bay and a family barely surviving a child's disappearance-this book could too easily have descended into sickly melodrama instead johnston begins well into the middle of the story indeed almost at the beginning of its end four years before the first page justin campbell age eleven vanished that torturous four year interregnum has wrecked his family his history teacher father eric is ensconced in an affair with a wealthier married woman an affair from which he seems to take no pleasure eric and his wife laura justin's mother no longer touch eric's father cecil watches his son's family suffer from the pawnshop he owns helping as best he can laura spends her time volunteering at a sea lab caring for a rescued sickly dolphin from the very beginning we see inside laura's psyche the thoughts to which she cannot give voice her resentment and anger over the years she'd purposely slammed her fingers in a desk drawer she thrown sweet tea into a fat woman's face at the castaway after the woman said i'm still just so broken up about your boy and then there were the times when she locked the bathroom door and sat in the empty bathtub watching the day succumb to night twice she'd come so unglued in public someone had to call eric at school to come and get her justin's brother griff now older than justin was at the time of his disappearance spends his time skateboarding in the drained kidney shaped pool of the \"half razed teepee motel\" and is inching into his first romance even four years later the family still spends time regularly refreshes missing posters and maintains a 1 800 tip line in their kitchen cracks are beginning to appear in the campbell family's resolve eric wonders \"who would be the first to speak of him justin in the past tense \" as elsewhere here johnston demonstrates his gift for language his sharp eye for detail his understatedability to capture emotion readers and characters alike are left unsure if these lives can recover for \"their world was discolored muted perforated by helplessness \" through shifting perspective the reader peeks into the dark recesses of each of these character's inner worlds what we see isn't pretty--such as laura's bitterness and or the secret thatthat justin was plainly her favorite or justin's sense of his own victimhood or giff feeling orphaned and his secret guilt-but it feels real and is always described with equal parts sympathy and honesty from the first this johnston delivers the family's grief and loss through myriad symbols cecil's pawnshop laura's dolphin and that abandoned motel johnston is a writer interested in his characters' relationships both with each other and with themselves thus he surprises us with the most disruptive event possible he gives his characters what they want a flea market vendor recognizes justin the police swoop to the rescue capturing his kidnapper justin is returned home to everyone's surprise he is not just alive but has been living with his captor nearby in corpus christi and not exactly under lock and key despite the joy at justin's return the sudden urge to resurrect all that was lost the debris of those \"lost\" years weigh on the family more than these tangible items the real weight are those years justin spent with his captor dwight buford and the way the events of those years remainbeyond his family's understanding as justin meets behind closed doors with prosecutors and his social worker the cambell family-like the reader-is left very much in the dark and again-just as with the reader-imagination and human nature leads them to conjure the worst what words she wondered did her son have to utter in those meetings what language formed in his mind what vile combination of letters was he forced to hold in his mouth and then spit out laura's stomach reeled she worried it was all too intense too draining and agonizing and she watched justin for signs that she should step in and call off the whole business... johnston balances this enforced ignorance against the rest of the story in a way that keeps the reader turning the page not only do we care for these characters but like his family we are overtaken by a prurient curiosity johnston knows how to paint guilt on the page instead of baroque sentences he opts for clean straightforward prose allowing his characters their own voices this leads to the biggest most thrilling surprise of johnston's novel-the story is quiet everything about this plot seems to lean towards being \"ripped from the headlines \" but there is none of the expected bombast or fireworks instead johnston gives his readers an authentic view that quickens with reality his clean prose evokes not the sparseness of raymond carver but instead comes fluid and natural where a lesser writer might offer explosions johnston's characters swallow back tears originally published in the drunken odyssey","135":"sometimes a really tough topic is worth the read i often feel like writers use the same subjects but this one ventures into the destructive psychological impacts of a close family that loses a child to kidnapping and then when the son is found has to deal with trying to be normal again this is my first book by johnston i sure hope he writes more i will now read the other book i have located by him","136":"not bad but never seems to get going and doesn't take any interesting turns","137":"the writing here is pretty stunning it seems as if johnston cannot write a bad sentence but ultimately the parts of the novel never coalesced into something greater the very skill that elevated the writing made the book feel almost labored and over worked","138":"it is an ok book but it's tinged with an underlying homophobia and is drawn out in an attempt to create suspense i'd give it 2 stars except for the more than competent writing style","139":"great book did not want to put it down","140":"i found this story of a boy that went missing and was found four years later quite engrossing especially during the build up to the town festival interesting epilogue that makes you rethink key events in the story","141":" what made me pick this book up was the plot an abducted boy is found after 4 years of being gone sounded like the promise of an amazing book to me how does he re enter his old life how does his family cope with his return what happens to the abductor unfortunately the book wasn't amazing it was fine i wasn't thrilled with the resolution of the whole matter and i think the characters would've benefited from a multi viewpoint storytelling format as it was written i didn't find any of them particularly engaging or feel like i could understand what was going on inside their heads","142":"dark and very focused on the character thoughts and feelings but so good recomended if you're ok with a damn good book that happens to be a bit of a downer","143":"great book it was a page turner that i could not put down the only reason i did not give it four stars was i was hoping for more of justin's perspective was told and not just his parents overall great story and great writing","144":" much as emma donoghue did in 2010's smash hit room bret anthony johnston leads us through the aftermath of human captivity but utterly unlike room remember me like this never lets us inside the victim's head in fact we knew very little of what happened to justin campbell who vanished one day near his home outside corpus christi tx the book opens four years after his disappearance with the news that he has been found instead of shining the character spotlight on the kidnapped johnston rotates the narrative through the perspectives of his parents laura and eric his younger brother griffin and his grandfather cecil through flashbacks we are immersed in their surreal existence in which one world halted the day justin disappeared and another spins on justin's room remains unchanged except for the pile of birthday and christmas gifts his mother buys for him every year the modest campbell house suffers from neglect as does the campbell marriage there are shadows everywhere laura is becoming one present only at the marine lab where she volunteers thirteen year old griffin grows up in the shadow of his brother and eric lives a double life it is an achingly real portrait of a family unable to grieve yet losing hope as the years pass without word of their son johnston masterfully maintains the tension of this loss and hope even as we know that justin has been safely returned to his family that tension morphs from what happened to justin to what will happen to this family now that he's back which is truly the premise of the novel upon her son's return laura transforms throwing open the literal curtains in the house and the figurative curtains of her depressed state griffin falls in love becoming the center of attention in someone else's world still playing second fiddle to his older brother at home campbell pere et fils eric and cecil turn their attention to justin's captor who is released on bail and remains in this sweltering grimy east texas community i couldn't put this down until well i can't remember when i last had such a change of heart and brain while reading a book i was riveted for the first two thirds then the tension simply spluttered out and i couldn't wait to be done with it because the author was so intent on not bringing us into justin's mind the emotions and actions of the rest of the family became repetitive to the point of exasperation eric and cecil's plot was melodrama that cheapened a nuanced and intense emotional thriller but couldn't lift the narrative from doldrums of navel gazing that brought down the final third the one character i most wanted to hear from justin had a walk on role in his own story it was a strangely unsatisfying experience yet this is tremendous vivid writing from an author i would seek out again i thank random house for an advanced reading copy","145":" wow honestly what a book there is so much to review i will start off by saying that this book has ruined the whole lost kid reunited with family genre no book will be of this caliber i will first discuss the language johnston is such a skilled writer the images he renders are so profound he describes everything in such detail that you feel that you are living in the story frequently throughout the novel johnston writes sentences with uncommon syntax which manages to make you feel the restlessness of the characters simply put he writes beautifully the plot is just as powerful i am a fan of the kidnapped victim genre and i found that most novels have two major problems they all seem to enjoy unnecessary drama and saccharine fluff this book contains none it felt so real and human their reactions actions and relationships with each other were so real and believable i hope johnston hasn't experienced such loss it is filled with such love and tenderness that you would imagine accompanying a lost child being found while possessing an undercurrent of pain and healing while there are so many obstacles the love that binds their family prevails","146":"i feel cheated this book had potential it really did i was riveted by the first few chapters and then poof the book that i thought i was reading and really wanted to read disappeared the characters just never truly clicked and the writing felt so forced and stilted","147":"i wanted to really love this the setup is terrific a kid who was abducted for four years is finally found and comes home and the family has to readjust to the new state of being how do find out what happened to him in the interim without re traumatizing him how to be a family of four again but the book seemed to lose momentum and there were so many unanswered questions by the end i don't know if the writer intended that those unanswered questions are really on the whole unimportant in the grand scheme of things but i thought that there were too many loose ends excellent framing but lackluster execution","148":"overall i liked this book i wanted to really like this book but i felt it never picked up momentum it was awkward yet wouldn't family life be awkward with the return of a missing child after four years especially when the counselors advised to not ask too many questions or press for information all of the characters were well developed and the relationships seemed true i disagree with the reviews that call this a fast paced thriller hwever there is ample meat here for a solid book group discussion","149":"3 5 stars for the character development and seamlessly switching between different povs","150":"sensitive and capable treatment of difficult subject matter evocative prose satisfying characterizations","151":"loved it loved it i felt as if i were one of the family heartbreaking haunting couldn't put it down a must read won this in first reads giveaway","152":"not sure who why this a characterized as having the pace of a thriller more a character study of each main character imo could have been done in fewer than 360 pages meh","153":"good book enjoyed it any book that gets me to wake up early to finish is a sweet read particularly on such a dark topic as kidnapping kids but bret anthony johnston the director of harvard's creative writing program can craft a sentence and tension nice","154":"fun to read a story all about te as and places familiar little predictable","155":" a boy is kidnapped in a small town in texas four years later the boy turns up apparently unharmed in a nearby town so very close to home this beautifully written compassionate novel explores the complex psychological reactions of the kidnapped boy his parents and his one sibling a younger brother after his return the parents wisely give the kidnapped boy emotional space and privacy to process his horrific experience he does recieve professional help thus giving the parents the confidence to leave him be the author follows suit in that many questions about what happened during the boys absense go unanswered for the reader there is never a feeling of a need for more it's that well done through flashbacks the author provides an emotional timeline of how this family reacts and attempts to cope with their ordeal from the beginning there is subtle and surprising emotional evolution within this family that makes for an intense and thought provoking read","156":"remember me like this is about an ordinary corpus christi family whose oldest of two boys disappeared four years before at the age of 12 and has been the object of a publicized search for all that time with abduction or murder assumed as a family with the surviving younger brother they have gone forward in daily grief and tried to reclaim normality but then the missing son is found living nearby he has been abducted after a skateboard accident and despite all the publicity of the search he has had some kind of life with his abductor an older emt he appears as he reappears to be in post traumatic shock he is questioned by authorities of course and by a shrink and everybody each parent and his brother and his grandfather who have restricted points of view rejoices at his safe return but the family is instructed not to pry and to let him tell his story when and how he can meanwhile the abductor--like ariel castro in the news--is seen as a pedophile a rapist and a monster and when he is released on bail pending a trial the family feels that justice has failed them and start to contemplate revenge and self defense a gun is introduced the perpetrator is a cypher without a point of view or any apology confession or explanation medical reports conclude that the boy had been raped daily and yet he had never been chained or locked up he roamed freely in the community where he had been kept and even had had a girl friend in fact when rescued he brought home a tame snake that the perpetrator had given him the art of this telling is that whatever happened remains an elephant in the family's lives avoided and unthinkable and yet they are all and each privately speculating as is the reader intimately connected and loving they can't fully know or believe each other while collectively they insist on the fiction of identity itself they all have secrets from each other parent and son husband and wife brother and brother johnston is wonderful in playing with the meta fictional themes where human complexity always trumps our distorted projective working fictions about each other i won't reveal the rest but this is a gripping complex and generous novel in league with the best of russell banks sue miller rosellen brown theodore weesner and alice sebold","157":" the story of a missing child and the aftermath of how this impacted his family holds appeal for its supposed promise of an unforgettable novel instead it falls flat with way too many pages a mother that drove me up a wall and forgettable characters in general i only finished it because i couldn't believe that it would have got this many good reviews and yet i didn't feel i had got to a point that anything was good about this book it's not a feel good story it's not got any surprise ending it's far too long and has no real redeeming qualities thus a waste of my time","158":" four years before this story begins eleven year old justin campbell has disappeared without a trace presumed kidnapped drowned or dead the campbell family is tormented by their lack of answers and their continued constant search for justin then justin is found and the campbell's realize that the nightmare they thought was finally over is far more complicated than they could have ever imagined \"remember me like this\" is a difficult book to write about without revealing all sorts of spoilers so i'll just say the book unfolded just slowly enough to maintain the suspense but quickly enough to keep readers engaged the writing was honest thorough and compelling there were several moments in the text when i was entirely skeptical--the character's behaviors and decisions sometimes seemed completely unlikely to me--but author bret anthony johnston always wrote his way back into my buy in showing how normal people in crazy situations can act in ways one would never expect i wish this novel had a sequel--not because the ending was insufficiently concluded--but because i grew to care about each of these characters so much and i would love to witness their continued stories as they move forward i suppose that's left up to the imagination for now...","159":"great story not really sure what happened in the end don't want to spoil anything for anybody so i won't say more great writing a story of redemption i think and that love can save us","160":"i enjoyed this book but felt that it was a bit monotoned interesting comment on the so called happy ending though","161":"beautiful and devastating begs to be made into an oscar winning film","162":"well written but over written","163":" 3 5 starsi wouldn't actually call this a gripping thriller more of a closely observed emotional journey i found justin's acceptance of everything a mite disturbing and can't help feeling it will all come out at some point i am really grateful there were only hints of what he went through and because of that i could quell my curiosity about whether he did in fact attempt to escape and if not why not there are actually a lot of loose ends to this story and for me it really worked not everything has to be known or closed to make a good story","164":"i liked this book great character development and story the only thing that kept me from giving it 4 stars is that i felt there wasn't enough closure in the end for me anyway maybe others like to fill in the blanks on their own great book otherwise","165":" in remember me like this we follow the campbell family from a different point of view many novels conclude when a kidnap victim returns home in this well conceived story it is the start justin campbell went missing at age eleven there were 'missing' posters placed around the area and law enforcement searched everywhere even divers searched under water but with no findings townspeople in the community outside of corpus christi texas were compassionate and supportive but less so with each passing year then justin is found he's returned and his kidnapper arrested but how did the family adjust his parents reacted differently and his younger brother griff now age fourteen has his world turned upside down once again many families split up when a child dies or goes missing unjustly they often blame themselves for what happened they'd give anything to change back to life before their loss we observe what happens to laura and eric justin's parents there is bitterness with the kidnapper but eventually there seems a betrayal at the legal system griff has a new girlfriend and a teenager's life that is filled with changes encounters more as some people wonder why justin didn't attempt to escape from his captor with griff and justin being teenagers experiencing how cruel life can be this writer was reminded of the young characters in to kill a mockingbird this would be a great read for a book club with unforgettable characters and a dandy plot one of the best books of the year","166":"very emotional i'll get back to a review","167":"i enjoyed this book good modern fiction johnston writes well and is capable of writing about each of the major characters in depth he hooks you write from the start with a prologue presenting a dead body lying face down in the harbor immediately you wonder who this person is and he keeps you in suspense until the book's end as a parent this book presents my worst nightmare the kidnapping of a child it's more than that though it's about the consequences on his family and how they adjust to his return nice work","168":"sometimes it's nice to just read a book that's not so literary this book offered that respite for me and i enjoyed most of the fairly disturbing plot i found the initial hundred pages or so fairly riveting and while the excitement dissipated a bit after that i still found myself intrigued by the plot in spite of questioning some of the characterizations depicted this would be a great beach read this summer","169":"some lovely prose helped me get to the end of this slow moving novel about a teenager who survives kidnapping and abuse to return home johnston does a good job exploring the complexity of family dynamics and nicely captures the ambivalence that can accompany trauma as well as the most joyous events in our lives","170":"now i remember why i don't like to read many novels it took me a few chapters to think this book might be interesting and then a few more to think that it is not the basic story is good but the characters were just so flat and the story so mundane that i returned it to the library when only 2 3 finished don't even care","171":"i finished it which says something but it wasn't a book which left any mark the run up to the discovery and the initial meeting was well written and gripping i felt great empathy for both parents but then it seemed to dissipate into nothingness i kept reading waiting for a twist which never materialised","172":"similar storyline to room by emma donah","173":"i would probably give this 3 5 if i could","174":"loved the story hated the ending","175":"this well written drama is not so much about the disappearance of a child but his reappearance 15 year old justin is returned to his family after four years of captivity in his absence his parents have drifted apart while younger brother griff tries to compensate for their loss the author focuses on the fragile relationships between the characters and steers clear of the facts about justin's abduction i understand the author's apparent wish to avoid sensational details but it also means that justin remained a mystery to me there were hints of trauma but mostly he seemed remarkably calm and well adjusted with such a terrible crime at the heart of the story it felt odd that johnston refused to allow his characters to ask the obvious questions","176":"pretty good but i was left wanting more the impact of this boy's disappearance and reappearance years later in this struggling family was explored to some extent in the other family members but we never got a hint of what it was like for the missing boy returning after all these years his silence was almost complete i think exploring his perspective would have been more rewarding","177":"i received a digital arc of this novel a few weeks ago i had never read anything by johnston before in fact i hadn't even heard of him but i was completely absorbed by the narrative after the second or third chapter and couldn't put it down which is rare for me i thought the concept for the novel was original countless tv shows examine police investigations into child kidnappings investigations into eye witness reports false leads dead ends and then finally the one clue that leads to the victim's rescue and return to their grateful families all neatly packaged into a sixty minute time slot remember me like this skips that part and begins with the victim fifteen year old justin campbell returning home after disappearing four years before however the story is not really about justin it's about his parents his younger brother and his grandfather the narrative alternates between each of their perspectives and we see how joyful they are with justin's return how they struggle to return to how things were before and how each realizes in their own way the same thing there is no returning the strength of the novel is in the characters each one is fully developed believable and unique in their sadness if the story focused on justin the story would have descended into melodrama and cliche as tragic and heartbreaking as justin's story is there are only so many ways an adolescent boy being abducted by a pedophile can play out interestingly it is his immediate family who have the true secrets as we discover how each has coped or hasn't over the past four years i thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it it takes a unique perspective on an otherwise tired story after reading this novel i look forward to getting my hands on johnston's previous works","178":"interesting perspective of a family's healing process","179":"there are three things i look for in a novel character plot writing give me one and it's almost always worth reading two is special and three a rare treat needless to say johnston's book is definitely plot driven the characters are pretty stereotypical and the writing is good but nothing special but what a plot a page turner with plenty to both anticipate and surprise i imagine the author thinking movie all the way and why not it's hard for writers to make a decent living and this would be perfect for a cinematic adaptation i won this on goodreads so it's an advance reader's edition and i think the raves from other writers on the cover were a definite negative to my first impressions of the book they led me to expect luminous writing and compelling characters i disagreed immediately with their descriptions and still do but the story johnston tells is so good that i was able to get past that disappointment it's not a novel to change your life or to spend time with re reading sentences for their beauty sometimes you just want to escape from the world around you and this is a fine place to go and skip the epilogue distracting and unnecessary","180":" remember me like this is the story of a family that has been reunited after a son has been missing for four years the reader is able to see deep into each family member's psyche however the family does not communicate and so their personal torments joys and fears keep them torn apart and lonely the few moments of family communication are impactful \"erik saw laura's eyes welling ... justin had said it in front of everyone he'd acknowledged that there was something to acknowledge and they could no longer pretend otherwise because they couldn't snuff out this new life with silence and they couldn't call back who they'd been by avoiding who they were now \" very well written and suspenseful","181":" disclosure i received this book for free through goodreads first reads when i first received this novel i didn't know what to expect i've read a lot of books that deal with the subject of kidnapping but never one quite like this four years ago eleven year old justin campbell disappeared now the rest of the family husband and wife eric and laura son griff and grandfather cecil each inhabit their own personal island of grief and isolation however when justin now a teenager is miraculously found all is not as blissful as one might expect the novel though never slow is very much a character study--bret anthony johnston describes their further unmooring upon justin's homecoming in minute detail using beautiful language i also find it interesting that the author chose to tell the story from each of the campbells' perspectives except justin's i think this showed a restraint that is not often used in novels about kidnapping although i am a slow reader it took me a particularly long time to get through remember me like this part of the reason was that i wanted to really savor the language and really get to know the family and their grief my experience was that the writing is so detailed and immersive that i would have to take frequent breaks as to not get too sad for them i am not one who typically favors writing over plot but this book was a notable exception but that's not to say the plot wasn't fascinating as well parts of it read like a thriller especially the last one hundred pages or so i found myself practically tearing through them wanting to know how the family's plight could possibly be resolved and whether everything might turn out okay for them i would highly recommend giving this novel a try it's a fascinating and unique portrayal of a family on the edge and manages to be relatable as well i will definitely share this book with my family and friends lest they miss out on something truly special","182":"chunky and telegraphed","183":"good family drama love the characters","184":"i really liked reading this book it's the story of a family whose son brother goes missing for four years and then is suddenly returned the story switches between perspectives of those who had been left behind to deal with the heartache and loss and the unknown of how to move forward in this uncharted territory it is heart achingly beautiful","185":"a good book fun to read","186":" the subject of this book is the devastating impact of having a child kidnapped the parents and brother are lost at sea in their own solitary worlds trying to cope the aftermath of having their son returned to them has a whole new set of complexities and pains that seem to bring no consolidation as they drift back to their lonesome worlds the author has written an excellent novel in trying to understand everyone's perspective and their pain he explores everyone's point of view except for the victim because as he states in an interview at the end of the book he's been through enough so we are left with the parents perspective of not fully knowing what happened to their son during those four years he was gone and that in itself if gripping mystifying and disquieting what parents knows truly what their children have fully experienced as they set out in the world and how they cope internally fascinating and upsetting read","187":"i couldn't read this book fast enough emotional and raw a tale of how a son's kidnapping and eventual return home effected each member of the family great character development and emotional charged","188":"outstanding a novel that is gripping yet full of a family's love","189":"although i enjoyed the plot very much and liked author's style of writing the ending was very blah it left many things unresolved","190":"really liked this book not just the usual gone missing novel there were lots of things left undetermined which i actually liked good character development and very nicely written","191":"great read even though it was about the abduction of a young boy book focused more on the family relationships and impact of abduction and reunion","192":" 3 5 stars but an upgrade for entertainment and originalitythis story reminded me of room by emma donahue and the deep end of the ocean all three are about abducted kids who find their way home or are returned to their families this novel moves back and forth in time but mostly stays in the present it is heart wrenching at times to hear from the perspective of the mother father and brother left behind we don't hear much from justin the missing and then found boy we are left wondering what really happened to him and this left me wanting more i appreciated the different perspectives and kept wanting to find out more about their lives","193":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a clever book about the dynamics of a family that's gone through a nightmare and then how they deal with this when the missing boy comes back some of the reactions of the family didn't really ring quite true to me eg they're told not to question the boy about what happened but really wouldn't they the end leaves you wondering though which is good i'd read more by this author","194":"wonderful book extremely sad if you have kids it'll be a hard read","195":"well written very different subject a boy who is kidnapped returns home four years later and it is about the differences in individuals in the family and collectively in the family as they try to readjust to his return and the emotional changes in all of them paage turner","196":"although the book gave a good insight in to how a family is affected by something like this i felt a disconnect with the characters the book was also a bit slow moving","197":" positives johnson's prose is rewarding and engaging to the reader he tells just what we need to know and one doesn't feel bogged down with unnecessary detail the pacing of the story is well done by moving through different character's heads and getting different perspectives the story advances in a satifying manner and keeps the reader turning pages the characters are given enough space where the reader gets to know them well enough and understand what motivates them negatives you really really have to get past the premise that a kidnapped kid was just on the other side of town allowed to wander outside at will and no one saw him in more than four years despite national media coverage this really makes for a tough suspension of disbelief sometimes johnson tries a bit too hard to have his characters state profound symbolic dialogue this includes the children characters too many chapters end with a soap opera like statement that is dramatically hyperbolic spoiler although the novel is clearly attempting to build toward a climax at the town shrimporee festival by the time we get there and the novel wraps up there's a sense that little has happened to get us here perhaps sensing this johnson tries to throw in a what if chapter at the end that contains mysterious possibilities but i would have much rather seen them played out in actual chapters in the lead up why keep the readers away from the actual facts spoiler i had a hard time imagining the father would even consider ruining his family's life again in the revenge storyline with his own father apparently johnson did also and backs him out of it but why bother going through with that aspect of the story if you aren't going to ratchet up the suspense with it the whole thing falls a bit flat and i found myself wishing he would have created more tension enough with the coping already overall i enjoyed the novel the focus stayed on the family and didn't take us into the dark recesses of the kidnapper or the kidnapping in fact we never see the bad guy at all we are left to deal with the damaged characters and how they will attempt to put their lives back together this is a flawed but promising first novel","198":"a page turner for sure even though there is a plodding along quality to the story which is about the reunion between a boy and his family four years after the boy was kidnapped the author did a convincing job of capturing the inner life of the family members as they grapple to re create their family great character development would love to read the story from justin's perspective","199":"this was a good book good enough to want to read on but not gripping more of an interesting psychological study on the different ways members of a family process all that has happened after a child who was kidnapped is found after 4 years away i would have liked to hear more of justin's story the kidnapped boy and how he moved forward after being found it was hard to read this book before bed because it gave me bad dreams about kidnapping","200":"stunning and atmospheric beautiful and sad i rarely read 'literary' fiction i prefer ya but this one was worth it every paragraph was carefully thoughtfully crafted and the characters were true and real enough that i catch myself thinking about them in quiet moments days after finishing although it was slow it was still gripping highly highly recommended","201":"i kept waiting for it to get better as it sounded promising but it just didn't it fell flat for me","202":"stellar characterization and dramatic tension","203":"very intense and moving","204":"an amazing first novel","205":"seemed to just talk around and around without really talking about anything","206":"the biggest criticism i've seen of this book is that it's slow while the novel definitely takes its time i also think it's a victim of mislabeling yes it's about a kidnapped boy who returns to his family but there is no mystery around who the perpetrator of the crime is this is in no way a thriller rather it's an examination of a family that's trying to put itself back together after both living through the absence of their son his discovery recovery and the aftermath i thought that johnston did a marvelous job of showing the private and public selves of each family member how they tried to think of each other's feelings and modulate their words and reactions accordingly i was expecting something far more sinister based on the cover and jacket but what i got was touching it's a meditation on how we never really know everything about each other but that doesn't and shouldn't prevent us from doing our best to love and accept each other","207":"might contain spoiler i really enjoyed this book and would have loved to give it 5 starts however i really wanted dwight buford to play out more i was hoping for excruciating detail on how he died and i had really built that up in my head that it would come don't get me wrong it doesn't take away from the story at all and him dying was enough pleasure for me storyline is wonderful and bret johnston is an amazing storyteller","208":"from bbc radio 4 book at bedtime in the aftermath of an abduction a family struggles to heal","209":"a slow read","210":"i was 'hooked' from page one the only reason i'm not giving this story 5 stars is my patience was starting to be tested about the last 100 pages i wanted the conclusion faster i just couldn't stand it any longer","211":"i was deeply moved by this story of a family remaking itself after the recovery of their kidnapped teenage son one of johnston's best qualities is his ability to create fully rounded characters there are no heros or villians here only real people living complicated lives","212":"i liked the premise of the book but several parts did just not ring true to me","213":" liked the idea of following up after a child is found but did not find the content very intriguing insightful or compelling i just didn't believe the writer had a clue about the reality of what he was writing it didn't feel true to me the voice sounded like someone imagining but without the guts to dig in there the mother was very one note everyone was i guess they are busy folks that don't want to go deeper into their psyches but this is a novel so they could have done so the scene were the wasted skate kids bring up a repulsive blame the victim perspective had the most power to me","214":" 3 5 to 4 stars justin is just 11 years old when he was abducted u0026amp was found 4 years later in a neighboring community the first half of the book grabs you u0026amp does a great job describing the struggles a family goes through after such an ordeal and how it affects each family member differently the second half sort of drags on i just kept hoping for more about what happened to justin during his captivity u0026amp more about how he felt about it all i would still recommend it as a good read","215":"there were no less than 4 problematic unrealistic plot points in this novel which ordinarily would mean i should have loathed it and yet i still really enjoyed remember me like this and would even rate it 4 5 what's wrong with me","216":" some of this book was very compelling but for the most part it felt bland mr johnston is clearly a talented writer but the female characters were really a problem for me laura's grief is unimaginable yet she's painted as a hysteric tracey who barely registers as a character is a sweet yet ultimately boring and predictable mistress the worst of all was fiona who could have been a super interesting character to delve into yet the author was too preoccupied painting her as a teen manic pixie dream girl and feeding her lines that sound like what he thinks a teenager would say and that sums up my problem really a book full of detailed portrayals of male characters but only one major and two minor females characters to speak of all painted with a broad stroke had a little more thought been put into them this could have been a great piece","217":" when i first started reading this book i was afraid the subject matter would make it difficult for me to finish but the difficult aspects were handled really well and i had trouble putting this book down the writing and character development was simply outstanding the author helped you sympathize with all of the major characters even while sharing their faults and weaknesses i was sorry when this book ended and the only part of the book i did not care for was the epilogue which was an attempt by the author to add some mystery to the death of a character instead of letting readers know where all of the major characters were several years after the incidents in the book which i would have preferred","218":"beautiful heart wrenching a quiet beauty of a book","219":" as a parent the exploration of a family struggling in the aftermath of a kidnapping sucked me in it's a story i've played in my head countless times in countless different ways in what if sessions i was fascinated to see how this trauma unfolded within the family and how it affected each person differently but i wanted more of justin i didn't want gory details--i couldn't handle that--but i wanted to know what he was feeling i suppose he didn't know what he was feeling and that's the point the author was trying to make but i wanted to be in that house with him during his captivity i wanted to know what his days were like did he try to escape did he know where he was did his captor encourage his anger toward his family there were too many unanswered questions for me i finished the book unsatisfied and disappointed","220":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i gave this book 3 5 stars i didn't love it i didn't hate it i like how it followed each character except for justin we never saw the world from his perspective one of my favorite parts was the end when eric is thinking about who killed buford too bad that was only a few pages long","221":" the writing is remember me like this is beautiful and evocative exploring the inner lives of a family whose oldest son has returned 4 years after disappearing while much of the psychology feels nuanced and realistic one major development feels implausible and uncharacteristic more problematic is that for me the depth of the characters does not compensate for the lack of plot this novel does not have the pace of a thriller as advertised in fact very little actually happens after the first 60 pages the novel is actively anticlimactic as johnson appears to be building to an exciting moment that ultimately does not transpire i will remember these characters particularly griff though i do not buy him as a 13 year old but was expecting more plot and less repetitive internal monologue","222":"it's every parent's nightmare losing your child stories fiction and non fiction make you cringe and break your heart as you travel the road of grief as parents deal with loss in this novel johnston provides a different twist justin goes missing at the age of 12 for the first half of the novel you follow his family throughout the four years of his disappearance it's painful to read how lost they all are how they try to hold their lives together the second half of the book however is where things are different justin's body is found alive and the remainder of the novel is discovering how this family will cope with his return of course there is a period of happiness but reality sets in how will justin cope what exactly happened to him how will the family come together what's missing is justin's narrative on the one hand you want to know more see more hope this young man can somehow mentally survive the ordeal you want to know more even though you know what he's been going through on the other hand you don't want to know all the details and when johnston lets in a detail or two it makes it that much more jarring depressing emotional read but most definitely worth it while you can't have a happy ending with something like this you can have the best of a situation and johnston delivers what most only wish could happen in real life","223":"a terrible ordeal for a family told without the need for gory details about the actual crime instead we delve into the emotional aftermath for all the characters affected so interesting and such a great perspective i was expecting to hear about the actual crime and maybe get a better picture of the perpetrator but i am so glad the author left that out that's not what is interesting here it's how the father and mother and brother and even grandfather navigate life post tragedy beautifully written","224":" a beautifully written examination of the interior lives of a family struggling to adjust to the tremendous changes wrought not only by the disappearance of their young son but also his return one might think that finding justin would erase the past and give them all a new lease on live allowing the pain of his four year absence to simply be swallowed up in time but of course nothing is as it used to be and they are all damaged and different than they were before his abduction it's a sad book but not one that leaves the reader in despair it's more as if the author manages to balance hope and despair in such a way that while there seem to be miles to go before they are restored there is a chance that they will find happiness albeit in a very different form than once hoped for if they continue moving forward i very much appreciated the author resisting the urge to describe justin's ordeal in a salacious manner for salacious and unnecessary see an untamed state it is hinted at and it is obvious but overly focusing on it would have been damaging and distracting from what the book was really about which is the emotional roller coaster that no one in the family can ever expect to exit","225":"i like it and i didn't like it this is a very strong story told in a rather slim and elegant language but i would have preferred a more compressed story i know that time is an important part in the development of the plot but still there is a bit too much of it here","226":"what happens to a family where a son disappears for 4 years and is found again the campbell family deals with this situation in this modern story set in southern texas the author does an admirable job showing various characters' points of view plus adding a lot of imagery in his writing that adds to a certain type of atmosphere balance to the emotions of this book see also the deep end of the ocean by jacquelyn mitchard","227":"its a slow read i found it hard to stay interested","228":"a very long book in which just about nothing happens","229":"this is a beautiful book","230":"overall i liked reading the perspectives of the campbell family after the return of justin and their reflection of how they dealt with him missing the novel well writtenas a character driven novel the characters were three dimensional and portrayed realistically even with all this i did still find this novel dragging a bit i would have liked to have read less about what the parents were thinking instead of what actually happened to justin and his four year captivity not nitty gritty details but maybe more of what justin was thinking then and how he was dealing with coming home now","231":"probably a 3 1 2 but rounding up because of the good writing and interesting story still too many long and somewhat repetitive interior monologues and nothing from the person we probably want to know more about","232":" this story is very riveting and it stirred up many emotions the major premise is how a family's son goes missing and is held captive for four years the story gives one insight on how this experience affects each member of the family and how the reunion impacts each family member as with many families there is a huge breakdown in communication and it was interesting to see how each family member neglected opportunities to engage in meaningful discussion on so many of the complex issues surrounding them my one criticism is that the ending was way too complete for a story that was just filled with too many elephants in the room and unresolved issues for one to believe that this family was on the road to healing that easily i am a little disappointed that some of these weren't resolved for us although life brings many terrible things to contend with the issues in this book were so severe and damaging i think i needed a sense of closure this is not an easy read emotionally but the author was successful in bringing me along on those emotional roller coasters this was just well written engaging and insightful i learned a lot about the effects of emotional trauma on different personalities","233":"remember me like this rmlt by bret anthony johnston was a terrific read by an author i hope is working on his next novel rmlt was johnston's first though he has one collection of short stories and others that appeared in short story anthologies in addition to this being a very powerful story johnston's writing techniques are awe inspiring the story begins four years after justin campbell disappears and is told through the eyes of his parents eric and laura his younger brother griffin and his grandfather cecil it's a mystery to the reader until nearly the end of the story how justin disappeared it's also a mystery to the characters did he drown was he taken or improbably did he run away despite the fact that it's been four years and little likelihood he'll ever be found eric and cecil tirelessly keep justin's status in the public eye regularly making the rounds to shops gas stations...anywhere where people will be reminded by seeing posters of his face that justin is still missing miraculously this is the thing that leads to justin being found and his captor being arrested in the first few chapters johnston vividly establishes for us how deeply the family members are affected \"that was the inconceivable and debilitating shock you could grow accustomed to what had once seemed so miserable and alien you could feel a foreign presence in your body endure the pain and deep threat of it and not notice as it turned to bone \"in the first part of the book johnston describes for us the depth of pain regret and guilt each character feels and how they've each found a way to cope it's amazing to me how he does this with so few words in the early chapters we're also introduced to a device that johnston skillfully and beautifully uses throughout the rest of the novel he ends each chapter with a poetry like analogy that transitions us to the next chapter there are so many of these and of passages within each chapter that i wanted to add to my list of most loved quotes from the book's description you already know that the story is not about the kidnapping itself or of justin's experience during the four years he's missing it's about how the event and its aftermath have affected justin's family and now that justin is returned to them how the family tries to repair the family tapestry that's been ripped and burned apart some reviewers fault the book for not giving us the same insight into justin's psyche as we are given to the other family members but i think that's a brilliant move on the author's part we're seeing the story from the other victim's points of view what happened to justin can never be adequately experienced by them and that's not the book johnston chose to write other readers have written wonderful professional level reviews if i went on i'd simply be echoing their words though not nearly as well i point you to the reviews by \"b the bookaddict\" and \"switterbug betsey \" in particular i'll just end by saying that remember me like this is a brilliant novel that i recommend to all my goodreads buddies move it to the top of your lists you'll not only be reading a mesmerizing story you'll be dazzled by johnston's skill as a writer","234":"this was an unusual book as you see a disappearance from multiple points of view each parent each child the grandparents the townspeople and the kidnapper fascinating read as you get to see how each is affected and changed by justin's disappearance and the readjustments everyone is required to make even those who don't have it in them to readjust keeps you enthralled until the last sentence i recommend this book unreservedly","235":"johnston's novel presents us with a family each managing the trauma of the loss and return of their oldest son in presenting us with so many unanswered questions johnston makes us one of the members of the family trying to make sense of what might have happened compellingly told by a constantly shifting literary voice as we hear the perspective of each member of the family each member except the prodigal son returned home","236":"brutal gripping raw i'm an empathetic reader so i can't say i enjoyed this book i was as uncomfortable as the characters were throughout i can say it is a great novel that will feel like it's been applied in some way to your skin when you finish reading it haunting no real happy ending which is kind of what real life is all about simply living it as it comes and no money back guarantees once worn it cannot be returned","237":"laura and eric are happily married with 2 sons when the eldest boy eleven year old justin goes missing after four years he's found and returns to the family how eric and laura justin and his younger brother griff deal with this is the crux of the novel interesting reading","238":"what a downer i do applaud the author for going where most film versions of the who took my child storyline do not go i was reminded of all the child kidnap movies where the entire story is the parent searching for the child the wonderful ending is when the child is found and everyone hugs surrounded by the obligatory police fire and other first responders bret anthony johnston asks what really happens next and takes on a family's attempt to rebuild after such a trauma that said i found nothing insightful or redeeming about anyone in this book not the grandfather not the father not the mother not the brother and not even the abduction victim they are all so damaged they are so closed off that would be fine if i felt something about them if they allowed the reader to know them it never happened","239":"loved the book and the writing characterisation excellent and story moves fast i will be on the lookout for ore from bret anthony johnston","240":"excellent writing and captivating characters an unexpectedly uplifting novel about past and present and how it exposes a family overall this was a heroic story told from various points of view and brought to life by detailed narratives","241":"this was so boring so boring beautifully written but so so boring","242":" i liked this book i just didn't love it it was beautifully written with heartfelt insight into a family struggling to readjust after their son who has been missing for four years is found the emotions of each character are beautifully nuanced and described and it is not a book where there is a lot of action i think a careful reader will pick up on that pretty quickly and so not be disappointed still i think the lack of more punch throughout the novel is ultimately what kept me from giving this 5 stars","243":" not bad the theme an abducted teenage boy returns home after being held and abused for 4 years concerning how people and families deal with tragedy and hardship and then sudden good fortune reminded me of a book i read several years ago about a mother and son held in a storage shed for years who finally escape the boy had never seen the outside world that story like this one dealt with how people adapt to the changes that are expected to be joyful but are fraught with potential traps and difficulties i liked that this book did not overdramatize the events and avoided becoming a thriller but instead stayed within the details of the daily lives of the family and their small community","244":"parents tend to value their children across cultures generations and geography here in america especially with smaller families being the norm we generally place a very high value on each child thus a story about losing a child becomes a sure bet to generate great emotional interest outside the realm of books tv shows exploit this theme endlessly some dealing almost exclusively with the recovery of stolen or murdered children on both the screen and the page most of these stories turn on finding the evil perpetrators often utilizing either police procedural methods or hyper involved parents as the instruments of retribution bret anthony johnston's story pays almost no attention to any evil doer to any villain to any torture or threat instead he examines the course life takes for the parents and children of a family whose eldest son has been 'gone' for four years simply disappeared like an argentinian malcontent the emotional strength of this approach is devastating examining loss revenge the effects of hope and uncertainty the implications of personal vengeance and the possibility of deliverance remember me like this tells a strong story i'd have cut 40 or 50 pages and used a less misleading title but i still think the book is recommended","245":"thankfully i've never had to experience the abduction of a child but even so i thought i would relate to a story about those who have i just did not like this book i read almost three fourths in print and then listened to the remainder there is a bit of suspense and mystery that kept me with it but all of the characters come across as living in a trance i couldn't see them as really experiencing such a horrific event overall i was disappointed","246":"this book was okay it is the story of one family's way of dealing with a son who has been returned to them several years after he was kidnapped","247":" original review found at http kristineandterri blogspot ca 2 i received an advanced readers copy of this book from random house via edelweiss in exchange for an honest review the expected publication date is may 13 2014 thank you this book begins where most leave off it explores the depth of emotions that a family struggles with after surviving the unimaginable where most would think that the happily ever after begins is where this book details what one family goes through it is raw honest and heart wrenching in its description of what each member of the campbell family endures the book itself is slow moving but rich and powerful in emotion and depth there are stories in the news all the time about people returning home after being kidnapped but i have never really thought of the struggles that occur after the fact for everyone and not just the victim until now each character carries so much guilt jealousy sorrow and paranoia and johnston details every aspect of it in such a beautiful yet painful manor his writing style is almost poetic if you are looking for an uplifting read you will not find it in this book in this book you will find an extremely emotional but honest account of what a family goes through after trauma i want to say that i really enjoyed this book but it feels wrong to say that given the content what i will say instead is that this story is going to stick with me for a very long time","248":"disappointing what could have been a novel of psychological and emotional depth turns into a superficial story a revenge drama","249":"so incredibly astute i felt as though i were reading nonfiction this is what stuart o'nan's songs for the missing should have been","250":" i had such mixed feelings about this book as a parent the idea of my child being kidnapped is horrifying and having most of the perspective of the story come from the parents and brother drew me into the story they were barely hanging on and then just like that their oldest son was found and returned home the reunited family was so fragile and it saddened me that they hadn't had more of a family friends church network to help them not knowing more about justin's ordeal or about his kidnapper was odd at first but grew on me for we got to skip the gruesome details and concentrate on his recovery from the nightmare the plot point that bothered me the most was that the kidnapper was released on bail that was completely unbelievable for there was proof justin was with him medical proof of the assaults and everyone involved with the case would have been hungry for revenge there is no way he would be out awaiting trial all in all i feel the book was really more a 3 5 than a 4","251":"interesting storyline kidnapped boy is returned to family u0026amp they must adjust liked the characters storyline could have gone many different ways","252":"i wanted to love this book but i just didnt it is beautifully written and there were many sentences that were truly perfect the plot moves very very slowly like a muddy river i was perplexed when nothing really ever happened right till the end i felt that this was a family portrait of life after a tragedy and as such it could hardly be better at rendering the awful fallout of an abduction yet with all the force of that weight there was something both unsatisfying and insubstantial about this novel i kept anticipating a climactic event or moment in the narrative that never occurred and perhaps that is a brilliant way of forcing the reader to experience what the novel's characters are also experiencing the writing is flawless but the structure and narrative of the story left me feeling ehhh","253":"portrait of a family in the aftermath of tragedy truth behind a mythic happy ending","254":" here what i want to say about this book what happened to the ending i invested time and alot of thought into this book loved the characters even though i didnt always agree with them i lived in their terrifying world for almost a week and i could not wait to see what happened i was waiting to see what really happened to justin but he never had a voice this whole book revolved around him and yet we know so little as to how he felt what really happened to him while he was abducted speculation is all we got the ending the same way i dont want to speculate tell me what happened to dwight buford who got revenge","255":"dark story extremely well told this guy has a beautiful facility with language i will be watching for more from him","256":"i don't know what coping is as it relates to a pool and it seemed to be pretty important to the story likely because of the double meaning of the word i also hated the incessant use of the nonsensical phrase do what i cringed every time i saw it on a page which was a lot other than that this was a decent book good story it was a little dark but had a happier if more confusing ending than i was expecting","257":"probably more a 3 5 but very good","258":"i wanted to like this book more but it just didn't hit the right places for me good language interesting characters worked hard on developing them and then i felt like nothing happened","259":" some readers will love this book but for me it was a disappointment this is a character driven book to the nth degree from start to end it spends nearly every page in the thoughts of the mother father grandfather and younger brother of a boy who was kidnapped and then rescued four years later how did they cope with the absence of the boy and how did they adjust when he returned johnston turns and turns these questions over with exquisite sensitivity and imagination he knows his characters and he invites us to know them and feel for them just as intimately johnston envelops his characters' thoughts in detailed narrative description of the environment and surroundings the wind the rain the grass the sky he has a gift for metaphor and turns of phrase and many times i thought ah hah i've never heard it that way but i know exactly what he means however the strengths of the book empathy for his characters and an attention to every detail are also its weaknesses the book moves so slowly that the plot is barely discernible all the thinking and feeling mostly lead nowhere either internally or externally subplots drift away the big finish at the end feels tacked on given what's come before and ultimately fizzles the epilogue runs too long and is confusing because it contemplates a more dramatic ending that i think the author dismisses as being only the musings of one of the characters the gift for detail is also a problem in that johnston uses it everywhere it can take two pages to cross from a car to a front porch everything seen heard or smelled must be painted in oils nothing can be sketched what's important this moment this moment this moment this moment as i write this i think maybe that was the point every moment is precious and deserves to be observed and appreciated and i think maybe so but couldn't we appreciate it a little faster lastly at the center of it all is the kidnapped boy what happened to him is mostly a mystery as is his healing process he's the patch of bare canvas in the middle of the painting i understand it was johnston's deliberate choice it makes sense in a way the book is about how the boy's family survives the trauma of losing him the boy himself is almost a maguffin granted interesting truly and yet the boy's own trauma is almost entirely absent how is that possible could johnston have kept justin's experience at a far enough distance so that it wouldn't overshadow the family's but still give us a glimpse of the storm that had to be brewing inside him","260":"good enough to keep me from finishing grades this morning because i wanted to see how it ended liked format of seeing the events through the actions and thoughts of the different characters not sure if i liked the epilogue","261":" this is a very sensitive portrayal of a family's reaction to a terrible tragedy justin one of two brothers disappeared at the age of 11 leaving his parents and brother searching for answers and struggling to hold themselves and their family together four years later justin has been found and after the initial delirious happiness wears off a new set of wounds emerge within the family the exploration of these very nuanced feelings is empathetic and heartfelt some of johnston's writing reminds me of anna quindlen or anne tyler although many of the emotions described rang true i found the general pace of the book to lag a little especially at the end","262":" maybe i was expecting something more along the lines of a thriller but this novel felt a little lackluster to me i kept waiting for something intense to happen and was left wanting taken for what it turned out to be i can appreciate the extent to which it delved into each character's emotional state but i must admit that it felt a bit repetitive at times it was the younger son griff who brought remember me like this from a two star rating to three stars i found him to be by far the most interesting person in the novel as well as a complex and admirable character big thanks to goodreads for sending a free copy of this novel","263":" i was lucky enough to receive this book through a goodreads first read giveaway i flew through this book i thought it was fantastic it centers around a family whose oldest son was abducted this in itself is an interesting concept because people go missing everyday most of them are never found but this story revolves on one of the exceptions the son is found after 4 years of being gone although a missing person being found is the best case scenario this book really showed how difficult things would be once the person returns a lot changes over the course of 4 years people grow and change it was interesting to see the family try to get reacquainted with each other and work through this difficult situation i liked how the book told the stories from several different perspectives i found all the characters relatable in some way in so many books i find myself identifying people as the bad guys and the good guys in the story the main characters in this book were all likeable they all had flaws and made mistakes but ultimately the reader feels that they are doing the best they can with a difficult unique situation i also really liked the author's writing style i thought he did a fantastic job of keeping the reader interested in the story he gave great descriptive details that helped me envision the characters and the place that the story took place in i will definitely be interested to see what this author does in the future and will read his future books","264":"the campbells older son justin has been missing for 4 years he left one day to go skateboarding and never returned the family has gone its own way always remembering to update flyers and try to keep justin in the news that's hard on a family but what happens when justin returns","265":"i cannot say enough good words about this novel it was just published last year it is set in the corpus christi texas area the author tells the story of a boy that goes missing and his family's attempt to locate him he is dsicovered 4 years later and was found to be abducted incredible story of the impact on the family and their reunification excellent","266":"while the story was fast paced and engrossing the only perspective that entirely worked for me was griff's mainly because you know what he is doing and why he acts the way he does also i was expecting a big finish a la defending jacob by william landay the stories felt similar to me in many ways but remember me like this petered out with more of a whimper than a bang","267":"a little too long and could have been condensed a bit i wasn't too crazy about the way it ended up","268":"how does a family continue eleven year old justin is kidnapped the family seems frozen in time going on searches again and again justin is found four years later how does the family find its footing they are so happy to have justin back yet each is wary mom never wants to leave the house dad seeks revenge brother tries to pretend all is normal a gripping story","269":"this is everything you want in a book a book that you will make you think about the characters long after you are done reading great book","270":"this story line is always one that attracts me maybe i like to be sad or worried or whatever this was good well written the fact that they actually never tell the reader what actually happened is something i still have to think about and decide whether or not i liked that","271":"a boy who has been missing for 4 years is returned home that sounds like it should be the end of the story but it's the beginning of this one it's the beginning of healing for an entire family but healing doesn't happen overnight particularly when the details of his time away are full of abuse and shame this is well written and ultimately hopeful telling a story behind the story in a very compelling way highly recommended","272":"too much character over development at the expense of story under development","273":"though a bit slow in parts and i was tempted to skip ahead i'm glad i stuck this one out it was a deep serious look at a family recovering from a crisis a parent's worst nightmare told from several character's perspectives it was honest and raw and at times a difficult read it was also pure and joyous and satisfying","274":"a beautifully written story about a family trying to come to terms with an unimaginable situation the characters are so well written i found myself worrying about them when i had to step away from the story","275":"good read in the beginning then slowed down and not a strong end too many unanswered questions for me","276":"this ripped from the headlines story goes beyond what we see on the news it's haunting terror and psychological impact it has on the parent victim and family post the return of your child is insightful and relateable i look forward to more from this author","277":"this is about a working class family mother father u0026amp 2 sons who suffer the emotional trauma of having their older teen age son kidnapped and held for 5 years while the story is interesting and easy to read i was put off by the characters' extreme emotional response to seemingly small events in my opinion the author strove to make the work exciting by having the characters react in a dramatic super charged way","278":"great book with great character depth i like the fact that it did not follow a predictable path the characters were real and flawed and loved great debut look forward to the author's next novel","279":"compelling and complex would be excellent choice for discussion groups","280":" devastating and original with an attention to detail which will leave the reader enmeshed in loss hope and unrelenting memory it is hard to believe that this is johnston's first full length novel he writes with the grace of a seasoned novelist the campbell family has been torn apart by the disappearance of their son justin although at first united in a quest to find justin time has worn them down eric has found some solace in an affair laura finds a refuge in dolphin rescue and their other son griffin

after but it is what was between those spectrums that will continue to haunt each of the campbells johnston paints an acutely vivid picture of a family suffering one of the worst crisis ever his depiction of the hot and unrelenting texas summer leaves you feeling breathless and sweaty the prose is clean lucid and flawless it is so compelling so taut he draws you effortlessly into the tide of the story remember me like this will have you holding your breath as it draws to it's surprising conclusion powerful and gripping you must read this novel most highly recommended 5many thanks for the arc provided by the reading room and the publisher","281":"this is a well written novel about how a family deals with life after their abducted son is found","282":" thank you random house and netgalley for early release in return for my honest review page turner master piece the story has an abundance amount of conflict and emotions between the characters and so beautifully written that i felt all the turmoil each character was living an 11 year old boy was kidnapped and found four years later four years of guilt loss grief fear and horror four years of surviving and now learning to recover the family members are walking on eggshells and fear to say the wrong thing to one another just when they are staring to feel hope and live again the justice system fails the family and sets the monster out on bail feeling violated all over again just like the previous four years looking into every face and place for their missing son the family is now looking at every face and place for the kidnapper and not wanting to do simple tasks such as stopping at grocery store each family member is trying to cope and process with everything happening and existing to survive all over again each character was brought to life a must read for the 2014 summer list","283":"didn't work for methis novel about the abduction of a young boy felt more like a clinical examination of a family rather than a story it left me cold it was well plotted the characters were engaging but it did not work for me","284":"this is compelling story but would have been better edited at times it felt like i already know all this sleeker would have made it more compelling","285":" some spoilers this had all the makings for a great thriller with a great end however its not i am actually really confused how it managed such a decent rating on goodreads i am not quite sure how i even finished this but 3 4 of the way through i was speed reading scanning the text desperately trying to seek some sort of ending this books is one super long drawn out climax that never does come to a head it is a total let down about half way through the book your waiting for it to pick up spoiler alert it does not you think its going to be this exciting crime novel that depicts what happened to a boy whom was kidnapped for 4 years it doesn't you think its going to tell you about the crazed kidnapper it doesn't you think something really exciting is going to happen it doesn't this book is a bait u0026amp switch what it is a hand full of dull characters that never play out to their full potential and the kidnapper u0026amp kidnapped who you think this book is about have very little written about them at all","286":" soon after johnston's story commences we learn that justin campbell a sixteen year old boy who was kidnapped over four years earlier has been found the book deals with the effect this tragic event has on justin and his immediate family--father mother brother two years younger and his grandfather the story slowly unfolds as we learn the details of the kidnapping how each member of the family suffered through the long ordeal and how they cope with the present healing comes from some unexpected sources such as a sick dolphin a teenage goth girl a pet snake a skateboard even an adulterous affair serves a purpose it is often painful to read but at the same time enlightening johnston has written a lyrical suspenseful story that gradually comes to a satisfying conclusion","287":"3 5 the writing and storyline are overall good but the female characters are flat","288":"i was totally blown away by bret johnston's remember me like this after reading that it was a story of what happens when a kidnapping victim is returned i was intrigued by this genre bending twist every character hits the reader hard i cannot recommend this book enough","289":"i received this book as part of the goodreads giveaway program many of the other reviews i have read about this book have seemed to be on point while johnston is undeniably a great writer the execution is where this book loses some luster at the beginning i was very interested in the campbell family each of them suffering in their own way for the 4 years their son justin was missing but what this book was missing was justin's viewpoint i would've liked to hear more about what happened the 4 years he was missing and how he was really feeling about being reunited with his family there were little glimpses here and there but not enough to really satisfy i also felt like the first 2 3 of the book really had a lot of action but the last 1 3 really hit a wall cecil and eric's decisions seemed to be a little over the top i would've also liked to know a little more about dwight buford and why he did what he did i guess that's always up for the reader to guess at but there were so many holes to fill i just gave up trying it's clear the ending although clearly conjecture on eric's part is likely what really occurred but i would've liked a little more insight into how it all really went down a decent read over all but not one i'd hurry out to buy","290":"as a mother this was so heard to listen to but i couldn't stop audiobook version","291":"if you're looking for a thriller this is not the book for you however you're looking for a book full of navel examining by every blessed character read on meh","292":"a well written haunting page turner with a lot of heart you don't find that every day","293":"this was a gripping novel exploring relief and suffering in the aftermath of a child kidnapping victim who returns home years after his disappearance the multiple narratives from family members helped show the varied responses fear guilt anger and joy the only character whose thoughts you aren't privy to is justin the kidnapping victim it's such a horrifying situation that i felt a little voyeuristic as i read a similar story happened in my hometown and i've wondered before what kind of life that young man was able to lead after he came home it's hard to think about and hard to talk about but i think it's handled well here the book is incredibly well crafted and i enjoyed it a great deal","294":"i really enjoyed this book despite the dark subject matter i was impressed with how the author pulled off frequent shifts in perspective among various members of a family responding to a missing child i was impressed with the specificity of the characters and the way that their responses evolved and revealed more about them as their conditions changed it was both a suspenseful page turner and a detailed character study of a family haunted by tragedy highly recommended","295":"the son has disappeared and the family deals with the loss well written if a bit slow i found the middle lagged quite a bit i also felt that the characters' responses to central situations unbelievable rendering the whole work flawed","296":" there is no question as to how remember me like this made it onto the new york times notable 100 list the lyrical writing exposed the souls of a family adjusting to the return of their son justin who was kidnapped four years ago each sentence was weighty and written with purpose despite the joyous homecoming underlying tension kept me wondering how stable the family was and whether all would be mended by focusing on each family member in various chapters the complex reactions of justin's parents brother and grandfather really showed the depths of each character the author glossed over justin's experience during the four years he was held hostage and instead depicted the family's attempt to move on with their lives some of these interactions were a little too mundane to be interesting this was a somber family drama and although there were happy moments throughout the story at times it was almost too depressing to read johnston is a gifted writer and great storyteller but i hope his next book is a little lighter i won this through goodreads please read more of my reviews on my blog http fastpageturner wordpress comor follow me on twitter at @dana_heyde","297":"i haven't even got half way through this book it's so depressing i have to stop reading it really have tried hard to find some enjoyment in it but none there for me at all moving on to something else now","298":"can we ever move on from the past when teenager justin is reunited with his family after being kidnapped for four years the author bret anthony johnson shows the reader that such an endeavor may not be done easily or quickly this is a story of a family that tries to move on from this terrible act and find that doing so isn't easy because in reality each member must learn how to remake a family whole again","299":" i mostly enjoyed this book it's a very well written exploration of the members of a family dealing with the aftermath of a years old kidnapping and then the sudden return of the victim their son grandson brother i thought the strength of the book was in the bleak beginning where we see the ways each person is affected by and copes with life without the kidnapped child where it went wrong for me was after the missing boy justin was found though we are given many parts of the story from the viewpoints of the various family members we never get inside justin he seems a cipher the author apparently didn't want justin's reactions to distract from the other family members and suddenly with justin on the picture the book lost direction i grew frustrated by the end feeling that the author was holding back","300":"this wasn't a horrible read there left a lot to be desired i wish more would've been revealed more about justin and his feelings it was very long and drawn out","301":"wonderful touching and brilliant it's hard to believe this was a debut novel i'm sure this author will provide many more amazing stories in his career","302":"good book well written unpleasant topic i just found it so frustrating that this family never discussed anything that happened to the boy but completely avoided the topic the boy was also a little too well adjusted after his horror experience it felt not real enough for me","303":"i received a free copy of this book via the goodreads first reads program and sincerely thank everyone who made that possible what a great book there is no way that this review can do it justice or convey the depth of feeling it evoked it was raw emotional powerful and achingly beautiful brilliant writing not a light read by any means but one that will really make you think about how people deal with things and how you would act and feel if faced with the same scenario this is one that will stay with me for a long time i will definitely be keeping an eye out for anything bret anthony johnston writes in the future","304":"bret anthony johnston's latest novel remember me like this will leave you transfixed gasping for air and emotionally spent months later you will still be thinking about each of the characters and the difficulties they faced and wondering what you would do if you were in similar circumstances i found this novel so engrossing the writing so compelling i couldn't put it down briefly four years after justin campbell disappeared he is found just a few miles away from his hometown what happens next as the family is reunited and they begin to search for answers to their questions forms the heart of the novel what exactly did happen was justin kidnapped did he run away lives are turned upside down and inside out as every interaction and conversation they ever had is magnified and studied and re examined this isn't a novel you can easily forget - a superb read and i highly recommend it","305":"an emotionally intense read that i had to force myself to put down so i would not neglect my school work","306":"it dragged i kept going to find out what happened to the family","307":"sad but redeeming portrait of a family","308":"a taut well constructed story the type you think of long after you have read the last page","309":" loved the corpus ambience the feel of place very much there is some beautiful prose in here too but a couple of major plot points which the story requires in order to have drama were just not believable so those took me out of it some lovely use of symbolism throughout but again a couple of clunky instances darlings which i felt an editor should have murdered still i finished the book the painful heart of the story is believably written and so necessarily unpleasant had to put it down at times if goodreads had a 3 5 i'd give it that","310":"well written serious fiction novel about a family struggling to cope after their son who was kidnapped four years before is found and comes home this story does not focus so much on the son and what happened to him and we get few details of his actual ordeal the story focuses more on the experience of the family members this book was a little hard to get into at first but it does pick up once justin is found the characterization was pretty well done although i felt like i would have liked to know more about justin overall i would recommend this book","311":"great plot thought provoking long after you read the last page","312":"taut and suspenseful psychological thriller about what happens to a family when a son is kidnapped","313":"i finished this book a few weeks ago and as usual am late with my review this one is hard to cast as thriller for me maybe more of a dramatic work the author bret anthony johnson tells us about a missing young boy returned to his family after four years the relationship between the boy justin his parents grandfather and younger brother is a fascinating study of how things were and are now and what they will become that is the center as well as the disappearance the extensive search by many and the finding of justin i liked a lot of things about this one especially the way it seemed like the locale the corpus christi texas area seemed so familiar i would like to visit the area to see it myself since it seems like i have already experienced being there the unfolding story develops with a lot of tension of the events and the characters emotions the book grabbed me and definitely held me in until the end received as a goodreads winner thanks so much","314":"this was both happy and sad nothing remarkable in the writing","315":"i received this book for free through goodreads first reads emotionally flat not at all what i expected out of this story it wasn't a bad book but it wasn't great either the author's writing style was clean and organized but the storyline would have been phenomenal with just a bit more something it had so much potential starting out each initial baited hook sunk in without question but then the reality hit that the future didn't hold a reeling in that there wasn't anything more than what was right in front of me maybe that's what the author was trying to convey that such a profound moment in a person's family's life wouldn't be the quick jarring ride that one would expect it would be a continuous series of mind numbing aftershocks each distressing in its own distinct way","316":"riveting and beautiful portrait of a family handling the return of a kidnapped son each section is carefully constructed as a short story","317":"fantastic very very believable characters and situations loved the ending","318":"most of this book was as expected and although it was a fine read i wouldn't highly recommend it to anyone the main story is that of the campell family who live near the gulf of mexico in texas their son justin disappears at the age of 11 and at the start of the novel is found four years later he's basically unharmed and has been living with his captor only a few miles away his homecoming is the start of the novel and the story proceeds from there and delves mostly into the ways that justin's disappearance and subsequent return affect his family father eric mother laura younger brother griffin and grandfather cecil are the main players and narrators like so many novels over the last 15 or more years this is another novel of alternating points of view in the 8th grade mrs gale taught us about show don't tell writing and i felt like the better part of this book was telling not showing with that said view spoiler the end of the novel kind of wrapped things up in a bow for me that was happy and satisfying hide spoiler despite the fact that i hadn't loved either the story the characters or the writing i ended up liking the book more in the final few chapters","319":"make no dinner plans i could not put it down and to read it straight through","320":"multi leveled and nuanced a very well done character study of each member of a family grappling with the disappearance of an 11 yr old boy lovely and haunting","321":"3 5 loved the writing and the way the story unfolded but as others have noted would like to have known more about what was going on in justin's head after he returned to his family","322":"interesting premise not read before about the after affects a victim experiences after a kidnapping expected a deeper look into the victim's handling of stepping back into his 'normal world' the author did handle the parents family and friends well a favorite with our book club","323":"beautifully written and very interesting observations about family dynamics","324":"i am a fan of the multiple perspective narrative in a novel and here i think all those points of view added punch i also liked the use of weather as a pervasive theme","325":"well written i bought it based on a recommendation in rolling stone johnston does a great job fleshing out the characters and it is a page turner my caveat is the ending very unsatisfying the author wants to have his cake and eat it too","326":" remember me like thisthose that have been reading my reviews this year have probably noticed that i usually don't dwell too much on how many stars i give a book perhaps this is something i need to work on next year but i considered any rating system extremely subjective arbitrary and frankly a little silly with that said i also admit that giving books low ratings 3 stars or less is difficult to me so i did agonize a little bit about giving a low rating to this very popular novel mostly because so many of my goodreads friends loved it ultimately though as great as johnson's writing is i couldn't bring myself to give remember me like this more than 3 stars so in summary here's my take what i liked about this novel the premise of the story is fascinating an exploration not of the abduction or murder of a young boy let's face it there are probably way too many books already written with that plot instead we get to see what happens when the victim seemingly unscathed gets to come back to his family and his community we come to realize that what to many outsiders looks like a picture perfect happing ending is anything but the story is a nuance and compassionate exploration of trauma its aftermath and how it could emotionally destroy the fabric that keeps a family together the author avoided cliches and platitudes and created instead compelling deeply flawed therefore deeply human characters what i didn't like about this novel overall this is a very slow paced novel but i thought the story is told from too many characters switching perspectives too fast the dialogue between teenagers sounded too mature and unnatural to my ears this is my one big peeves when reading fiction children or teens that sound either too childish or too grown up for their age too many lose ends that left at least this reader without a sense of closure i found many passages particularly in the second half of the novel extremely boring and redundant and finally and i admit that this might sound a little bit petty i found that way too many words were dedicated to describe skateboarding although overall remember me like this is a decent read to me it felt flat somehow i craved that feeling of being surprised or engaged","327":"i absolutely loved this book","328":"this was a difficult book to read a missing child a family torn apart but what kept me reading was the author writing in different scenarios each character would think maybe this happened or if i do this then the strength of the family is shown in the different ways they react to events","329":"meh story of family life after a kid who's been kidnapped returns home kinda drags on and not much happens","330":"thanks remember me like this for getting me off book club parole i found this book to be interesting at first and then flame out in the latter half it's about a kidnapped boy's family and the experiences they have in years after the kidnapping the family members experience emotional changes although not always for the better the reason i'm off book club parole is because generated lots of conversions at book club way more than anyone would have thought many opinions and topics were brought up other than that this book is a bore","331":"this is a powerful story about what happens to a family when a child goes missing i found the book well written and realistic i was a little disappointed with the penultimate chapter however i highly recommend this book it would make for a great book club discussion","332":"i don't know how i knew about this book but it really fascinated me","333":" review of arc bret anthony johnson spins a haunting and emotional tale of the happy before shocking during and confusing adjustment to an altered reality after a boy disappears from a family and its perfect mundane texas life and returns a scarred teenager no one said happily ever afters are easy or painted with a single stroke this book delivers an emotional narrative from the five primary members of the unfortunate campbell family each more deep and aching than the other a slow and deliberate read","334":"would not recommend this book to anyone it was so slow","335":" this started off quite promising 12 year old justin disappears one day after leaving to go skateboarding the family falls apart and spend the next four years doing everything imaginable to try and find him unexpectedly the family receive a call with news that he has been found and will be coming home to them again we follow the families recovery the ways in which they cope with the fact that he was abducted and the healing process that ensues unfortunately details about justin's kidnapping and four year absence was never mentioned i couldn't really sympathize with him as we weren't told what happened to him a huge flaw in the book in my opinion toward the end i felt the author focused more on describing surroundings than actual events and it lacked a satisfying conclusion","336":"even after reading bret anthony johnston's wonderful debut short story collection corpus christi i was totally unprepared for the overwhelming experience of remember me like this from its ominous opening pages i found myself caught up and transfixed as one is by only the most powerful works of fiction in my opinion it's a flat out masterpiece one of the most brilliant novels i've read in recent years as the story of a family whose son has been kidnapped it's almost unbearably harrowing to read but the line by line writing the rich imagery and the intricate working out of the plot make it eminently worth while johnston raises the stakes by making the many characters both compelling and specific there's not a cliche in sight time after time the novel delivers a sharp emotional blow often with a devastating line that slices right through the writing is quite superb but it's always in service of the story never calling attention to itself as fine writing i particularly admire johnston's discipline he never loses focus there's a tendency in many otherwise excellent novels to go off on riffs that while entertaining tend to call attention to the author to the detriment of the story that's not the case here despite the lyrical evocation of both the urban landscape and natural environment of a small texas town sweltering in a faulknerian summer there doesn't seem to be a superfluous sentence in the book the result is a novel that's both complex and unified one of those truly satisfying reads that one yearns for certain novels in my reading life have stayed with me over the years as total experiences in which every element the plot the imagery the characters the structure all contribute to a work of art that is larger than the story it sets out to tell the ones that this novel sent me to for comparison were robert penn warren's all the king's men and fitzgerald's the great gatsby in those works as in this one the story gripping as it is reveals itself to be in the service of broader themes well handled as it is here this is done unpretentiously essentially subliminally only at the end does one realize the universalities of this very specific story i'm not good at predictions but if merit were to rule remember me like this will be read and remembered as a major work of fiction and bret anthony johnston will take his place among our most accomplished writers","337":"gripping and well wrought exploration of what can happen to a family when struck by tragedy the structure of the book following the actions and thoughts of the the 5 protagonists was well done and maintained a good tension throughout","338":"excellent but painful story almost could not continue to listen to it as the narrators were so good at the emotions of it that it kept making me feel so sorry for this family that and i found the end a little disappointing though it did wrap things up and kept one guessing one of those books where the author never really answers some vital question and left the reader to make certain assumptions or maybe i missed something","339":" i found this to be a little slow at times and yet i think that feeling was intended by the author think back to some awful tragic or sad event in your life perhaps the passing of a loved one or how you felt on 9 11 did minutes feel like hours each one fraught and heavy with emotion that's kind of what the author creates here for instance you observe these people trying to navigate a family dinner that is so laden with unspoken thoughts and emotions it feels like you are choking on their food for them or you watch them independently trying to cope and feel certain at times that they just aren't capable of doing it frankly i can't say i liked the sensation it was almost painful to bear witness to this but i do think johnston has done an impeccable job of what it must feel like for a family to survive and ultimately heal itself from this unique type of tragedy","340":"writing was not amazing but beautiful insights into how each of the family members might feel after the return of a kidnap victim","341":"this book is surprising in good ways i was pleasantly surprised by the plot developments all far less melodramatic and more nuanced than i had expected a story of a non dysfunctional family for a change despite great trauma","342":"great read probably close to a four and a half rating would recommend","343":"this book took me a long time to finish because i kept putting it aside to read something else it is a painful story and the heaviness of it all wore me down it's well written but the story never really takes us anywhere i wanted to hear hear justin's side of the story in addition the ending was a cop out","344":"first thing's first i received a lovely hardback edition of 'remember me like this' courtesy of a goodreads give away for which i'm really grateful because it was awesome the cover while not stunning or remarkably eye catching i think it reflects the story and the genre sufficiently 'remember me like this' is the story of a boy justin campbell who is reunited with his family after disappearing some four years previously after reading the blurb i expected the book to be more about his actual disappearance and what happened to him while he was gone however bret anthony johnston chooses to focus on how his reappearance affects his parents brother and grandfather although it wasn't what i expected it was brilliant by exploring the aspects of a disappearance that you don't usually get to see and a completely unique narrative what's obvious from this book is than johnston certainly knows how to tell a good story with a strong water tight plot i'm trying to fault it i really am but i just can't the plot moved at a decent pace that kept you enthralled and there were no parts that i felt were unnecessary or that dragged the story begins with a prologue in which some people find a body and ends with an epilogue i really liked the prologue but i didn't think that the epilogue added anything that couldn't have been added to the last chapter or put in another chapter but i guess i'm just not a fan of epilogues in general as to mr johnsons characters they have been ingeniously crafted i expected a central character to stand out presumably justin but instead you get four main characters that interact with justin his mother laura his father eric his younger brother griff and grandfather cecil then through those characters we get to know justin i especially loved the scenes involving justin and his younger brother griff the only character that could get on my nerves sometimes was justin's mother laura campbell simply because i like strong characters rather than ones who break like i felt she did however her interaction with her father in law cecil did eventually redeem her not to mention i've experienced far more annoying characters in the past also i could understand he why so i did have some sympathy for her which is rare for me with such a character the only other thing i wanted to mention was the few moments of what i'd call black humour namely the part when after their reunion laura is reluctant to let justin out of her sight even to go to the bathroom he sees this and tells her something similar to 'if i'm not back in three years call the police' i just had to mention this because i thought it was a great bit of comedy to break the tension overall this was a great book not at all what i expected but brilliant all the same","345":" won as part of a goodreads giveaway i haven't settled yet on whether this is four or five stars i'll probably go back and forth several times it is an excellent book and an easy read in terms of how it holds your attention the subject matter is not a light one but the author does not add any unnecessary torrid details in fact there is minimal gore or disturbing images i love that it covers the thoughts of the four or five main characters and the thought processes behind their reactions to extremely stressful events i identified with all of them at one point as a parent a sibling i won't be giving this book away as i often do but will lend it to as many people as possible","346":" i love the band centro matic intensely i love them so much that i frankly don't recommend them to people that often i'm not selfishly guarding my little indie rock secret rather i worry that if i recommend them to a friend who doesn't appropriately flip out then i'll like that friend just a little less forever and ever world without end there may be something similar going on with bret anthony johnston's work which is why you may not want to talk to me about this book i have a hard time maintaining critical distance i want to defend these characters i find myself saying things like yeah but you just don't know griff as though the little brother in this novel is a personal friend i feel my face flushing when i write the title down for someone i look in their eyes a little too intensely as i pass the paper over i'm ready to turn on them in a second if they read it and don't like it i don't want to talk plot here or reveal anything because i went in completely blind and appreciated each slow and careful turn besides this is very much a character book and i think other folks' reviews will show you how this book might disappoint plot driven reading i will say that these characters feel as real to me as any i know in fiction that johnston evokes the texas coast perfectly that he manipulates suspense expertly that i finished this book and felt wrung out that while i was reading it i was a crappy conversationalist because i kept closing my mind up inside the covers before i walked out the door i'll tell you also that you should absolutely read it just be ready to keep your opinions secret from me roughly forever if you don't love it nothing personal it's about me not about you","347":"interesting characters suspenseful plot","348":"in the years after 11 year old justin campbell disappeared from a small town outside corpus christi tx the non stop flow of flyers posters billboards and news updates cemented his name in everyone's memory i understand i have never forgotten the names of several long time missing persons in my area a tribute to the persistence and hopes of the families who have lost a child in his debut novel bret anthony johnston takes us behind the scenes in the lives of one family devastated by this experience it is not pretty the ballast is gone there is no instruction manual no model of behavior no emotional guidance how long do you keep plastering those photos around town how long do you wait by the phone conduct searches in essence how long do you hold out hope father eric mother laura and younger brother griff are all untethered each forced to find new paths to solace fleeting as it certainly is because their lives may well be broken beyond repair then after four years of facing one excruciating day after another the campbells learn that justin has been found alive but as those of us know who have had with direct experience with missing children or read novels like the deep end of the ocean and room a family's reuniting after such trauma is just the beginning of yet another often very difficult challenge as laura realizes at some point \"her notions of justin's rejoining the family were hardly more nuanced than all of them bounding over a fence hurdling from despair on one side to salvation on the other it was ridiculous \"but in this story the before and after fence has yet another hurdle a few months after justin returns home the man accused of kidnapping him is released on bail a new brand of terror now assaults the family unrelenting paranoia you can see that \"remember me like this\" is an ambitious effort it covers immense emotional ground mostly in the characters' heads the reader becomes the omniscient one privy to the parents' and griff's fear horror depression hopelessness and guilt ineffectuality even thoughts of revenge emotions they never divulge to one another as they struggle to put on a good face i generally appreciate getting inside characters' minds and i thought this worked exceptionally well in johnston's novel but only up to a point after the accused is released i began to feel shortchanged i wanted to know more about the readjustment period and not be distracted by more brooding as yet another serious challenge was faced also i was sorry that we never knew justin's thoughts omitting the details of his years of abuse made sense as the reader could imagine those well enough but once he is back with his family what's going on in his head we get rare glimpses and wonder if he is as fragile as others assume he is we never learn however for the novel's climax turns on an unexpected event and leaves us with just a brief unsatisfying if prettily phrased coda and as a minor point mature 16 year old fiona's attraction to the much younger griff never quite made sense to me this heart rending novel had intelligence and depth and i had expected to rate it five stars but as i considered the above points and how the narrative seemed to drag in the last sections my initial enthusiasm waned","349":"i felt a little let down the book seemed incomplete with too many unanswered questions it was an interesting story that should have left out a ton of unnecessary details and instead answered questions the reader wanted to know why didn't justin try to escape what was his life really like while kidnapped was he really so well adjusted coming home or was it an act we never get to find out also without giving spoilers the ending had the potential of going somewhere interesting but didn't the book had potential and nice characterization but needed more for me to rate it higher than 3 stars","350":"a good book better than i had anticipated taught and dark reminiscent of the room or the diner","351":" i'm thoroughly impressed by bret anthony johnston and remember me like this the writing is nuanced and restrained and the story is thoughtful and well paced johnston crafts the story in a very deliberate manner allowing it to slowly unravel and shining the spotlight on the characters readers are thrust right into the story until you feel like you're a part of this family living through the unimaginable i think there are plenty of people who won't connect with this book as it's very character driven and without much action but anyone patient enough to accept a well crafted story for what it is will be immediately sucked in with bated breath","352":"well written and a great premise but achingly slow i almost stopped reading it several times because i felt like i was being strangled by the excruciating minute details that didn't lead anywhere then the plot would finally pick up and i finished it in one fell swoop partially to be done with it and partially to see if this story went anywhere i liked that we never heard from justin as his story is his own and we are as cut off from it as readers as his family","353":" xxx i received this book as a goodreads giveaway on february 17 2015 from penguin random house and bret anthony johnston thank you so much for allowing me to read this book i wanted this book because it is set in the texas gulf coast an area that i love i will keep and re read this book because is it wonderful remember me like this is the story of the recovery actual physical and emotional of justin campbell abducted when he was twelve justin has been the subject of many searches over the years with aging progressions every couple of years and a great deal of involvement by the community of southport texas in the searches the campbell family three generations have spent these years trying to fill in the holes left by justin's abduction they are no longer the family they were of course they are viewed by themselves and others as damaged people are sympathetic but can't seem to take off the kid gloves when dealing with the campbell family after four years two weeks and four days justin is spotted at a swap meet in nearby corpus christi but getting justin home is only the first step in the recovery how do you bridge the gaps between then and now with the least amount of pain bret anthony johnston does a wonderful job of taking us along on the ride back to a united family and community his writing flows and absorbs you to the point of missing sleep to read on the pain and compassion of the family and community are heartfelt and the healing well defined i would recommend this book to readers everywhere you will find yourself so involved that you are a part of southport and the campbell family this book is well worth the cost of a couple of nights of missing sleep i am pleased to add bret anthony johnston to my authors to follow list","354":"it was okay too much inner dialogue for my taste thr epilogue was silly and unnecessary","355":" it's been 4 years since justin disappeared while out skateboarding in a small gulf coast town his mother is dealing with his disappearance by losing herself in her volunteer job his father is having an affair and his younger brother is lonely and practically forgotten when the surprise phone call telling them that justin has been found comes one afternoon everything suddenly changes this is a touching gripping mystery but the real story is how families deal with grief fear and the realities of life during and after 4 years of looking for a missing child the characters are believable and as the story plays out i could feel the tension build this is not an action packed story yet i could not put it down perhaps real life and real emotions are filled with enough tension and suspense to sustain the story i really liked this book but can't really say why other than that i found the story of the campbells compelling and i became emotionally attached very quickly i picked this up because of the setting i grew up in corpus christi the local descriptions are accurate and really add to the realism perhaps that was the real appeal but i think it was the story itself i could relate to the reactions of each of the major characters and couldn't wait to see how it all turned out","356":"i loved the deep characterization and empathy for the characters even the parents of the perpetrator of the crime i could smell the gulf of mexico and feel the heat and humidity of corpus christie i sensed the fear and anxiety of the main characters and felt their pain and anger mr johnston created tension and suspense when there was little action just a family tiptoeing around one another fearful to ask certain questions","357":"yuck switching back to create tension booooooring this book is too long for me to hang in","358":" five starscontains spoilersthe book starts off with a male body found floating four years prior when he was 11 years old justin went out with his skateboard and never returned the author then takes us backward through many of the events of the past four years justin's father eric copes by having an extramarital affair his mother laura copes by working at the dry cleaners and volunteering at a marine life facility helping to nurse a dolphin back to health retreating to her room sleeping and going off the deep end occasionally and even hurting herself justin's younger griff copes by skateboarding and getting involved with a slightly older girl his grandfather cecil becomes a recluse then the unthinkable happens justin is found and returned to his family all those years he was only a few miles away in corpus christie so obviously the floating body is not that of a boy but of a man i loved this book it was told from the point of view of all justin's family members but never his point of view the author lets out only a very few specific details of what happened to justin during those years which makes the horror of what he endured that much worse in the mind of the reader this book is about rebuilding each family member after justin's return about rebuilding relationships between various family members and about rebuilding the family unit itself it is both gut wrenchingly horrific and tender it will make you go inside your own mind and wonder what would could you be capable of if this happened in my family a fast paced page turner that will leave you a different person for sure","359":"loved how it ended but i thought that the bit to the ending was all too long i was quite fed up with the explanation of the family until it dramatically got exciting all in all i was satisfied with the book","360":"interesting perspective on the return of a kidnapped child if you think of books as a way to challenge your conventional wisdom this is a good one it well written as it thoughtfully walks through each character's emotional state of mind and wellbeing i cried a couple of times so i guess that means the author's words resonated","361":" this ended up being one of the best written books i've read in a long time i was completely hooked and enjoyed the story as it slowly unfolded with a sense of dread and sadness looming throughout when eleven year old justin is abducted his family falls apart with grief and nearly loses hope of ever seeing him again then four years later he is suddenly found a few miles away and reunited with his family his parents eric and laura and younger brother griffin what should be the happiest development in their lives is still enveloped in depression as the family struggles to cope with life with justin back as well as his kidnapper living in the town on bail i loved this book and think it would make a great book club selection i'm especially interested in what others thought of the ending i did agree with others that the last 15% or so wasn't as great as the rest of the book but still i was completely enthralled by this one and highly recommend it","362":"hope is rewarded in bret anthony johnston's first novel remember me like this random house digital galley when an abducted son is returned to his south texas family after four years although life has stood still for the campbells in some ways since the day justin walked out the house with his skateboard it has moved forward too eric a history teacher is having a half hearted affair with a local surgeon's wife while his wife laura finds solace as a volunteer monitoring a sick dolphin at a nearby marine lab son griffin is 13 now the age justin was when he disappeared he's into skateboarding and his first girlfriend having justin home with all the accompanying questions about what happened to him in the interim complicates family life in unforseen ways the police have arrested a corpus christi man who turns out to be the son of an acquaintance of justin's grandfather cecil although cecil declares justin's return has been a boom to his pawn shop business he is enraged when the alleged abductor is released on bail eric takes to spying on the man's house and joins his dad in plotting revenge laura tries to hold the family together and make sure justin goes to counseling griffin gets into a fight defending justin at the skateboard park as for justin he sleeps during the day and keeps to himself at night johnston is a psychologically astute writer who charts the family's shifting dynamics with sensitivity even the secondary characters are well drawn especially griffin's girlfriend fiona whose bohemian looks and clothes can't hide a tender soul but the only family member whose life isn't unsettled by justin's return is the labrador retriever rainbow she's just happy he's home from on a ckear day i can read forever http patebooks wordpress com3 5 stars","363":" excellent book although the story centers around an abducted teenager this is not a 'crime story' centering on the who why investigation trial aspect of the abduction the teenager is recovered 4 years after his abduction and his family is together again the book goes in depth to show how such an incident affects the family the mom the dad the sibling first they spend 4 years dealing with the fact that the boy is gone is he dead is he alive where what's happening each deals with the trauma in different ways then all of a sudden he is back and the family must switch gears to deal with making the family 'whole' again not just in number but in finding their individual ways back to 'family' again i really really enjoyed this book many of the reviews i have read share disappointment that the story didn't move very fast that it wasn't a very good detective story etc but that is not the purpose of this book there were a few minor flaws but overall a great read","364":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here slow and wordy liked the story but needed some paring down eleven year old is stolen for four years and then is found mom dad and younger brother griff having sex at thirteen was disturbing he seemed way older than his chronological age throughout never wanted to stop reading just a bit of a slog","365":"great set up but the ending and characters didn't live up to it","366":" listened for review random house audio overall rating dnfaudio rating 4 00 not part of the overall rating it's not you it's me dnf review i gave remember me like this by bret anthony johnston 2 5 hours and just could not get into the story this is one of those thrillers that i think you have to care about the characters in order for it to work and they just did not click with me i do think this story will work for other people audio thoughts narrated by mark bramhall length 12 hrs and 45 mins mark bramhall did an excellent job with the narration his pacing was excellent and each of the characters had distinct personalities that his voice enhanced i will give books narrated by him a try in the future notes about dnf ratings i am a moody reader sometimes books do not work for me simply because of the mood that i am plus i think reading is so individual and what works for one reader won't work for all i track all books that i read and that includes dnfs have to keep it real i always suggest reading other reviews on all my dnf reviews","367":"i lucked out and received this book through a goodreads giveaway contest because i had marked it on my 'to read' shelf the story grabbed me from the first page and was tough to put down i liked how it unfolded without flashing back and without forced narration it felt like a very natural window into the way a family would rebuild after suffering the worst kind of tragedy i could relate to all of the characters and how they handled themselves in the aftermath telling the story of after rather than telling the story of the event itself was a unique literary choice that i enjoyed recommend","368":"when their son kidnapped four years ago returns a family celebrates but struggles to come to terms with their feelings of guilt and the challenges of rebuilding their lives","369":"initially i thought this would be a very formulaic read but it developed into something much more interesting it avoided telling us everything that happened instead focusing on the effect the events had on the family members i believed in all the characters and felt deeply for them i thought the end was a little lacking in impact but i enjoyed the book enormously despite that","370":" remember me like this is a powerful and insightful look at how family members react when a texas boy returns after being missing for four years the author tells the story as it unfolds from the perspectives of the mother father brother and grandfather justin's return sparks complex emotional responses in all of them the writing is very good the characters feel real the book differs from some similarly themed books by not providing details about what happened during justin's abduction i'm only giving this four stars because even though i liked it very much i didn't find anything unexpected examples of how some issues are addressed when justin shares some information with his younger brother for the first time in the truck griff sat quietly trying to figure out how to respond there were countless things he wanted to tell justin but he didn't know what to say a sense of awe had overtaken him the expansive feeling of a long wait coming to an end and he couldn't yet appreciate the implications of what he'd heard how or if it changed the past present or future later now with justin there always seemed to be the promise or threat of a sign a symbol that required decoding griff found it exhausting when the father grapples with how things have changed since his son's return he was hit with how much life had changed in a year's time the notion was mystifying stunning overwhelming suddenly incomprehensible eric was seized by something so inevitable so mysterious and unexpected that it seemed almost holy for a moment he thought he would collapse how an acquaintance reflects on time spent with justin's mother it was what happened when you spent time near someone who suffered the way laura had you felt the stranger you saw the void surrounding her isolating and diminishing her and you saw her seeing it too undoubtedly what everyone experiences around laura was what she experienced around her poor ruined son you saw only the wounds","371":"haunting disturbing tragic set in my hometown familiarity with the locale but not the theme of kidnapping proved a tantalizing paradox","372":"i wasn't as into this as everyone else seemed to be i thought it opened strong but about half way thru started to lag a bit all the characters might not have been necessarily likable but they were real which is ultimately what usually makes a character unlikable real people have flaws real people are irrational and scared and jealous and self absorbed not tirelessly brave and endlessly selfless the way our heroes and heroines so often seem to be written in that sense i liked it but at the same time i found myself getting a bit irritated with laurie but for the most part i was engaged and entertained the ending left a little to be desired but a solid three out of five","373":"remember me like this by bret anthony johnston is a powerful perceptive and gut wrenching book it pulls at the heart strings without ever being maudlin and invites the reader into a family that is struggling to keep their heads above water while wave after wave pulls them down the novel starts off with eric campbell involved in an affair he is a teacher of texas history at a local high school in southport texas not to far from corpus christi he sees his lover tracy one day a week after classes four years ago eric's son justin was kidnapped and since then his wife laura has been distant and removed even from her own self laura and eric have another son named griff who is a high school student and a skate boarder recently griff has become infatuated with fiona his first girlfriend there is also cecil eric's father who is an integral part of the campbell's life justin was eleven when he disappeared the campbells have never stopped searching for him they put up posters billboards sent out search parties and have even installed an 800 number the campbells have never stopped hoping that justin is alive at the same time living always with the fear that he is dead laura has continued to buy him birthday and christmas presents for the whole time he is gone this had been her life wrestling with hope and hell until she'd come to think they were one and the same whoever believed hope was a gift had never lost a son each of the family feels guilt for justin's disappearance and this guilt eats up the very core of their existence they go through the motions of things but any real intimacy is lacking laura works in a dry cleaning shop but her real love is volunteering at a center for rehabilitating dolphins there she dotes on alice a dolphin found stranded on land sick and febrile who she hopes will make a recovery cecil runs a pawn shop and a year after justin's disappearance someone brings in his skate board though it does not provide any substantive clues as to justin's whereabouts four years after justin's disappearance eric gets a call from the district attorney requesting he appear in corpus eric is suspect they have been called to corpus christi on more than one occasion to identify dead bodies and run aways that were not justin this time however they have found justin he has been in corpus christi the whole time kidnapped by one dwight harrell both eric and laura are ecstatic and they think their life is redeemed the novel very brilliantly shows that their lives don't change that dramatically though justin is now home he is preparing for the trial of dwight harrell seeing a social worker regularly and his circadian rhythm is switched so that he sleeps days and is up at night justin is quiet reserved and polite in fact he is the least developed character in the book which i believe is intentional once a boy that was petrified of snakes he now has a pet snake laura wonders how this could have happened she realizes that in four years so much can change and she was not there to see this eric keeps his distance from justin not knowing how to act around him justin occasionally shares some of what happened to him with griff though the whole family has been instructed not to ask him questions the book goes a little into justin's time with harrell but this is not the novel's focus the focus is on the family people in the community are elated that justin is home they make banners celebrate send cards and flowers but the campbells still flounder it's like we were all on a sinking ship and now we're each in our own lifeboat floating away from each other people tell them that the worst is behind them but they think really once the worst happens it's always happening it's never not happening the characterizations are brilliant each and every character in the book comes alive with their own unique and powerful persona the writing is glorious so many sentences are gems that i wanted to hold on to and keep at my fingertips this is a wonderful book of family loss and courage to face the worst and best that life throws at us","374":"a tough topic to say it's an 'enjoyable' read but the author does the job perfectly","375":"i liked this book it was a page turner and not too predictable good characters too","376":"this was a major disappointment all build up and absolutely no climax while the writing was good and the story and character development had promise the book suffered from analysis paralysis don't believe the hype","377":"read this for book club in lr and only 2 of the 5 book clubbers actually finished it well written and beautifully told yet so so heartwrenchingly sad that it was hard to get through interesting perspective on trauma and grief and putting things back together","378":"two stars is being generous considering it was so boring i gave up it starts out with suspense and then just drags","379":"john irving praises this book for its architecture and that was what first stood out to me the haunting prologue is followed up by multiple storylines and points of view as a family grieves for their lost son without changing his prose johnston is able to build up multiple characters so smoothly so quickly it's impressive to behold he knows how to set up a story i thought it meandered a bit in the middle but not for long and it might just be a function of the characters meandering in their own lives but the conclusion is just as taut and suspenseful as the opening johnston picks up on so many nuances of grief but never panders to the reader's simplest emotions each character even the secondary ones offer something unique overall i was very impressed by this book and think it would be great for book clubs the story brings up a lot of simple things to chat about but the craft and thematic development warrant more in depth discussion great book","380":"best horror book i've ever read it centers around a 12 year old boy who goes missing for four years and the aftermath on his family riveting and beautifully beautifully written with a wealth of empathy and understanding but not for the more anxious of parents and probably not the book one should read around father's day","381":"thanks to goodreads and random house for the advance copy this brilliant novel comes out may 13 2014 amy hempel blurbs on the front cover of the arc which i assume will make it's way to the back upon publishing both devastating and transporting this is the rare novel a reader lives in so persuasive is the impact the insight the heat of south texas i couldn't have said it better myself this is a gripping novel that sometimes reminded me of the stories of raymond carver but with the pace of a thriller illuminating the inner lives of a family reeling from the return of a kidnapped son this story is at once an indictment and homage to the american family johnston spotlights one of the worst fears of the typical american family losing an innocent child to a monster when this happens the focus is immediately on redemption bringing the child back finding the monster delivering justice but johnston shows us that it can never be that simple even when there is a return a redemption the scars of guilt grief and fear still linger and johnston masterfully reveals that many of these emotions were there all along i love what johnston does with the theme of guilt when something bad happens to the typical american family i think we often feel like we deserved it and when and if it's ever redeemed it's hard for us to move on like the family in this novel we're so hell bent on making our lives make sense that when bad things happen we almost expect them as the price we have to pay guilt finds fertile ground because we know that our motives were never pure in the first place i won't go into the plot but it's as rich and sturdy as they come i think i could've read this in one sitting and i'm sure many will this has bestseller written all over it but i feel certain there will also be a heaping of critical acclaim and maybe film rights it's that good i believe this is being touted as a first novel but when reading this you can't escape the feeling that johnston's done this before","382":"this definitely did not have the pace of a thriller it was very descriptive but lacked mystery and action","383":"yes now this is what i'm looking for in a book great suspense great characters thanks becky for the recommendation","384":" one of the most beautiful and thought provoking books i have read this year bret anthony johnston's first novel remember me like this delves into the psychological aftermath of losing a child and how it affects not only a grieving family but also an entire community instead of writing the book from the perspective of a lost child johnston recaptures how when justin is returned to his family after four years the family deals with the surging and haunting revelation of their son's unexpected discovery strikingly captivating and fluidity written johnston captures every sense of the human condition losing a child is a parent's worst nightmare no question but the aftermath dealing with traumatic affects it has on everyone can be dauntingly horrific as well and when nobody discusses justin's four year absence from his family the situation between family members start to deteriorate until one day when one specific incident changes everything for everyone remember me like this is spellbinding and worth the hours or days it takes you to finish reading from beginning to end a real tear jerky and i am glad i purchased this book on a whim sometimes taking chances on a new author is the most worthwhile investment for readers i did not want the story to end that said i hope johnston writes another literary work of fiction soon","385":"couldn't put it down","386":"solid novel with an interesting premise how does a family deal with the mysterious abduction and the reappearance of a child while i liked the plot and characters the pace of the book was hard to follow at times the authors reveals the thoughts and feelings of the characters in way that felt very scatterbrained while this felt true to the characters' struggles i found myself having to reread sections of the book in order to get a grasp on what was happening","387":"waited for a twist turn that never occurred","388":"loved and had a workshop with him great writer great man","389":"very moving and breathtaking novel about a family's response to the abduction and subsequent return of the oldest son the books strength is in the exploration of each family members way of coping with such a horrendous tragedy a very interesting read but i gave four rather than five stars as there were times i was drifting off and not completely riveted","390":" i won this book through a goodreads first reads giveaway the premise of remember me like this really caught me and i was so excited when i won a copy sadly this never managed to pique my interest though it was very well written i found it to be slow going and about 2 3 of the way through found myself starting to skim through paragraphs never a good sign i very rarely give up on a book once i've started it but after reading some of the comments left by other reviewers and seeing that there was no insight in the end as to what really happened to justin i decided to throw in the towel","391":"this book goes on u0026amp on i kept waiting for something to happen meanwhile it focuses on an extremely disturbing topic","392":"more like 3 5 goodreads add half stars the story is good and the characters are interesting but i thought it moved a little slowly there was great tension throughout the chapters told from different characters' perspectives but i didn't find the payoff to match the tension johnston built","393":" fantastic not what i expected and so very original exactly the kind of novel i like whatever that means i think it means lots of long internal monologues and killer sentences god this book is heartbreakingly beautiful and original and not at all what i expected it to be there was no cheap 'trauma porn' type shit and mild spoilers the story is less about the experience of being abducted and so much more about how justin's absence and return affected each of his family members in turn and exactly how his experienced impacts all of them in both gigantic and tiny ways a really cool premise that is beautifully executed damn i enjoyed this book","394":"better than average child abduction story well written good character development with each person involveds psychological issues interestingly described","395":"geat summer read","396":"this is a memorable book about the long term effects of a kidnapping after being missing for 4 years justin campbell is found and his kidnapper arrested but when he returns to his family it's their emotions and reactions which are the focus of the novel his mum laura dad eric little brother griff and granddad cecil a highly moving book which shows that trauma doesn't stop after an ordeal is over","397":"well written scary story but very different in a lot of ways","398":"it is summer on the texas gulf coast justin campbell missing for 4 years is unexpectedly found unharmed his parents grandfather and brother have to adjust to having him back with them just as justin has to adjust to his rescue whereas there are many novels that tackle child kidnapping and abuse not so many confront the difficulties of the aftermath it is not a case of \"happy ever after\" as johnston explores so effectively in this compelling and thought provoking novel i certainly found the book gripping and a real page turner at first for the tension about whether justin would indeed be found unharmed and then for the tension about how successful or otherwise the family's adjustment would be however there was also much in the book that left me puzzled and unsatisfied the rest of this review contains spoilers so you may not want to read on if you haven't already read the book the biggest problem for me was that we never hear justin's voice his perspective on what's happened overheard gossip suggests that he suffered sexual abuse but it's not made explicit in fact the impression is that his captivity wasn't that bad he was well fed had video games to play pets and even a loving girlfriend his family are advised not to ask him any questions and that makes sense but the reader on the contrary does want to ask questions and is entitled to not knowing any details leads to a distancing from justin and his ordeal i accept that the author's focus is on the family but i still believe the reader deserves more knowledge about what happened especially as justin is held not very far from his home and seems to have some degree of freedom he's eventually spotted out shopping so why did he never try to escape or contact his family another problem for me was the fact that his abductor - supposedly a paedophile - is released on bail and he goes to live with his parents not far from justin and his family this seems improbable to me and in the book leads to an unlikely and convoluted plot by justin's father and grandfather to make him pay for his crime and un unlikely relationship between justin's grandfather and the abductor's father i can understand that the family might want to take revenge but as the police would surely also understand this why would they release the man into the community where he would be in danger from the family and possibly the wider community such unanswered questions as well as some unnecessary sub plots stopped this book becoming the success it so nearly could have been for me and left me feeling frustrated and disengaged however there's no doubt it's an interesting premise for a book and that johnston's writing is eloquent and the pacing skilfully controlled and even if i found aspects to criticise this is still an interesting and absorbing account of a family in turmoil","399":"a well written book that explores the way a family might cope when one of their own goes missing how would you feel what would you do to pass the sleepless hours not action packed but such an honest glimpse into the family's everyday lives that you feel as if you know these people and you feel the heat of the summer days and the cool of the glasses of iced tea in the last chapter justin's father reflects on what happens and imagines a different scenario i imagine that the scenario was an alternate ending that the author could've given the book i was satisfied with the ending he chose for it","400":"good story but long narratives went on and on ultimately rendering many passages repetitive and boring and as others have said we missed hearing from the character at the center of the storm","401":"in the beginning i would have given it 4 stars but then it got tedious while at the same time being somewhat fascinating watching a family fall apart separately while still trying to function together the ambiguous ending sealed it for me i just wasn't satisfied with how it left me hanging","402":" huge thanks to netgalley for giving me an opportunity to read and review this book summary four years have passed since justin campbell's disappearance a tragedy that rocked the small town of southport texas did he run away was he kidnapped did he drown in the bay as the campbells search for answers they struggle to hold what's left of their family together then one afternoon the impossible happens the police call to report that justin has been found only miles away in the neighboring town and most important he appears to be fine though the reunion is a miracle justin's homecoming exposes the deep rifts that have diminished his family the wounds they all carry that may never fully heal trying to return to normal his parents do their best to ease justin back into his old life but as thick summer heat takes hold violent storms churn in the gulf and in the campbells' hearts when a reversal of fortune lays bare the family's greatest fears--and offers perhaps the only hope for recovery--each of them must fight to keep the ties that bind them from permanently tearing apart review and opinion the first half of this book was extremely intense and i could feel the pain of each family member it was extremely hard to believe this is johnston's first published novel he crafted it like a pro the author did a fabulous job creating each family member drawing the pain and sadness each felt by the loss of justin i could feel the reality of each ache and tear laura felt i could touch the guilt and frustration eric endured as he tried to hold together his family never stopping his search through some miracle the family did stay intact but not necessarily as a whole of different parts readers could tell early on that each family member is treading water in their own way waiting for the nightmare of justin's disappearance to be over then after four long years justin comes home the rare miracle of an abducted child being returned home is a beautiful thing family and neighbors breathe a sigh of relief the missing posters come down and reward money is paid out this book looks at the \"what now\" after being without justin for so long how do they reconnect to him how does he reconnect to them this book's plot development was long in the making most readers would think the pinnacle would be justin's return and the family adapting to their returned member however that particular plot point occurred early on in the story then the bad abductor is released on bail the whole family freezes like rabbits that've spotted a fox family once again falls apart each in their own way bottom line great parts of the book johnston created each character thoroughly his research into child abduction and the court system was evident in his writing bottom line not great parts of the book it took forever to get to the \"so what\" of this book i was not on the edge of my seat some points left me very frustrated with the characters when laura turned back into a mom zombie after bad abductor was released on bail i thought \"you know you still have your kid back why are you not focusing on that don't you think he may need your support now more than ever \" eric stalking the bad abductor's parents' house left me feeling the same way the character i ended up feeling deeply for was griff justin's younger brother while he wasn't neglected or shoved to the side during justin's absence his parents drifted away from him to protect themselves in a way it seemed like it was a matter of survival they knew how painful the loss of one son was they didn't dare hold much love to the son they had left fearing it would be a betrayal to justin or worse that they would for some reason lose griff as well and be forced to go through the pain all over again","403":"decent took quite a while to get started kept waiting for the other shoe to drop glad for the plot twist 100ish pages from the end that hooked me and kept me up late","404":" wonderfully written character study four years after eleven year old justin goes missing in south texas he is found alive and returned to his family he was taken by a pedophile and held in an apartment in a neighboring town the kidnapper is the son of a wealthy family known to justin's family there is no brady bunch ending for justin and family as they try to assimilate one thing that is hard for them to understand is why he stayed at the apartment because after a while justin was left alone for periods of time and came and went as he wanted but did not try to come home or get help this happens in true crime stories i've read similar to this and i can see where it would be hard to understand but it happens again and again pedophiles and sociopaths are incredibly skillful at manipulation the family already fragile after four years of not knowing what happened to their son now has to find their way while knowing what happened to him powerful","405":"nothing happens in this overly detailed book tons of potential w the various storyline and in the end this book was a waste of time","406":"i was really blown away with johnston's ability to convey his characters through their perceived emotions also the writing was superb truly beautiful to read","407":" this was just ok for me i think i would have enjoyed it more if justin had more of a voice in the novel there was very little from his pov and being that he was the kidnap victim it really bothered me that we didn't get his pov or story or anything it was eluded as to what happened to him even if the da or someone in the book discussed it more i think that would have been ok this book had a whole lot of really nothing in it it bugged me i kept thinking i'd get to the part of his story of what happened of something yet there was nothing this book just lacked so much the more i think about it maybe this book is 1 5 stars for me","408":"set in south texas this book paints an indelible picture of a family torn apart by a missing child and then creates a page turner mystery midway through well written different interesting compelling","409":" wheni first started reading this remember me like this by bret anthony johnston i was captured by the its mystery and imagery and intrigued by my having no idea where the author was going as johnston revealed more and more i became less and less compelled to read on bogged down by repetition therefore sluggishness although i was never tempted to put this book down i was nevertheless disappointed with the clunky last third of the book however the premise of the book and johnston's crisp original style of writing rendered it a clear 4 star rating","410":" a masterpiece told from the four persepectives of family members as they try to deal with the return of their eldest son kidnapped four years ago and only just rescued the boy only plays a peripheral role remaining a stranger not only to them but to the narrative instead johnston switches between the mother father grandfather and younger son as they all cope in their own ways in fact the rescued son seems the least affected by his trauma since johnston chooses to put all his energy into the others who he reveals have suffered during the son's absence and return in their own way the absolutely great idea of this book is that it's all aftermath the son is rescued reunited safe but johnston unflinchingly shows that four years of searching and heartbreak can cause wounds that take a long time to heal the conflicts pains and torments are all as the family members pick themselves up and deal with trying to return to normalcy this would be the epilogue in most books johnston makes it his whole novel it's a tough read as johnston lays bare the souls of each of his characters as they try to make sense of the world it's a searing story of what happens after the supposedly happy ending and how nothing can truly be happily ever after in the harsh world","411":" i can't really add much to the other reviews except to say that this book just missed being great as far as i'm concerned there were just too many pages of description of the characters' mental states especially of laura's that i started skimming them waiting for the story to pick up again i did like the fact that the story is never told from justin's point of view it is more that he is the maypole and everyone else is holding on to a ribbon circling him sometimes closer sometimes farther away it's a compelling story and well written except for some of the turgid writing exploring the characters' innermost thoughts","412":"this is a novel about a family in crisis they had been in crisis mode for so long that they didn't know how to react when their situation changed for the better four years before the story begins their 11 year old son justin disappears the mom dad and remaining son spend those four years searching for justin and re creating their family around his loss as the novel begins justin is found he has been kidnapped and is living only a few miles away the family is thrilled but there is a new family crisis on how to integrate justin back into the family interestingly enough the story is told in the voices of all family members except justin so the reader never learns exactly what happened to him during those four years the novel is well done and the characters are believable the story alternates between extremely sad and very hopeful for the future as the family struggles to learn how to become a family again","413":"couldn't put it down haunting bittersweet and beautiful","414":"beautifully written but the pacing in the second half of the book was off i became frustrated and just wanted to finish it","415":"okok story the characters never seemed real to me i will not recommend this book to others it was too flat","416":"loved the book justin campbell disappeared and his family holds out hope that he will return after 4 years the unthinkable happens he is found then you think that all will be well and happily ever after but you don't think about all the emotions the family is going through love hate guilt sadness happiness and grief for the normal life they shared before the kidnapping and when the kidnapper is released on bail what lengths will you go to to protect your child","417":"couldn't put this book down it was so suspenseful and emotionally compelling that it kept me turning the pages but there is mystery here and questions to be answered that seep into the mind of the reader and nag until you finally get the payoff you're looking for johnston's writing is lyrical and beautifully descriptive as he renders the psychological reality of a family in the aftermath of a mythic happy ending after their kidnapped son is found not only is this a subject i haven't read about before but depth of the character's lives and their specific emotional situations felt new as well as if i was in the hands of a master i'd read anything this guy writes i think this will be a big book","418":"just okay book opens up with a drowning who is it of course you don't find out until the end of the long detailed book it was well written but just did not move quickly enough for me a son returns home at the age of 15 after being abducted at 11 years what transpires is the way the family handles his return and the way he deals with being back it did keep me reading because i wanted to find out who actually died","419":"no doubt about it johnston is a fabulous writer he captures despair and heartache in such a realistic way that was my problem with remember me like this i feel like i was depressed in my own life while reading it i don't want to completely dog it because it is a great story written amazingly just be ready to feel down in the dumps i guess that's what a good writer will do really make you really feel the story","420":" johnston has achieved near perfect realism in this story about a family choking on the strain of surviving a child's abduction these are quiet people who love each other but are still learning what exactly that means in the wake of a nightmare and who feel completely inadequate to communicate an overwhelming crush of emotion the narrative does not overdraw the abductee's experience but stays with the family as a whole relying mostly on the younger brother's first love to add warmth excitement and a feeling of spontaneity the rest of the novel is admirably unsensational or i should probably say unsensationalist readers seeking a realist's exploration of a traumatized family's daily life will find much to relish in johnston's elegant storytelling thrill seekers should look elsewhere","421":"excellent read i look forward to his next book","422":"remember me like this was a very good read the story was intriguing enough to keep the reader interested and the variety of characters and their descriptions helped in the understanding of the plot it didn't end as i would've expected it to however it was good read nevertheless i would definitely recommend it to others","423":"this is a powerful story full of such perception and depth of character and it's writing style captures and challenges the reader's creative brain to reconsider the ordinary in a fresh way weaving through the in depth characterization is suspense building","424":"this was an interesting book it managed to be a sort of thriller even though it started when what would traditionally be considered the thrill was over i really enjoyed getting into the heads of everyone in the family it didn't bother me at all that i didn't really know what the kidnapping victim was thinking unless he verbalized his thoughts i also think it did a very good job of portraying a normal family you can see what they were willing to do to protect their loved one","425":" four and a half stars so close to being spectacular this novel is a gorgeous balancing act it has the heart of a thriller but it draws out the pacing and builds quiet momentum wonderful language fascinating story outstanding observations of human nature and emotions terrific characters like some other readers i was disappointed by the ending but still impressed that johnston sustained this incredible balancing act for as long as he did highly recommended despite my lukewarm feelings about its conclusion","426":"just did not like this book switched between too many points of view and was very slow the ending left me wondering why i spent time reading this book the premise of the story was promising but the execution just was lacking","427":"this was a beautifully written and very haunting read where the author delves into the lives of one family who has faced tragedy then had an unexpected resolution - a child they thought lost is returned to them which you would think would make everything perfect with \"remember me like this\" bret anthony johnston has taken that theme and explored where such a happy event can also cause huge emotional issues not only for the child who was gone and has come back older wiser and changed but for the family that was left behind always hoping but perhaps beginning to come to terms with the loss every character in this novel is gorgeously drawn and authentic very real emotions come off the page and it is often sad but also very uplifting a picture is painted of a family that was fracturing even before justin went missing in those small ways that creep up on you... after he disappears the shockwaves of that continue to affect them then when he returns the aftermath of that is enthralling wonderful scary and brilliant i was especially fond of the relationship drawn between the two brothers both before and after for me this was at the heart of the story perhaps even more than the parental interactions - griff was the character i related to most growing up as the child left behind his survivors guilt affecting him in ways he doesnt understand - then suddenly justin is back different and yet the same a traumatic event whilst also being a supposedly happy one the story ebbs and flows as everyone adjusts to yet another new reality - it is perfectly paced and has a mystery element with regards to justin's disappearance but that is not what it is really about this is about family love holding onto hope and learning to be happy in the face of huge upheavel brilliantly done i don't want to say too much more because the whole point of this is to take the journey with the campbell's - evocative and terrifically compelling this is one that will stay with me highly recommended","428":"whew it's finally over i really wanted to like this one i kept waiting and waiting to like it but never happened","429":"this was the first book i ever cheated on halfway through i felt such total empathy and concern for the characters i could not stand waiting another two hours or so to finish and find out their fates i immediately skipped to the epilogue and then went back to reading normally","430":"drags for a while but an interesting idea just too much yammering almost seemed like the author was trying to teach us some psychology i did like the ending maybe a little too neatly folded but it made me give it 4 stars rather than 3 yeah there's a great review hahahahah sorry","431":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book kept me tense waiting anticipating a big event following justin's return as the big picture emerges from the many many beautifully written small details and offhand thoughts of the various characters and yet a big event is not the point here it is the day in day out existence in the years long aftermath of a tragedy that bret johnston depicts so skillfully i loved that the end did not provide closure despite the death of dwight that the reader is left with the open question of this book kept me tense waiting anticipating a big event following justin's return as the big picture emerges from the many many beautifully written small details and offhand thoughts of the various characters and yet a big event is not the point here it is the day in day out existence in the years long aftermath of a tragedy that bret johnston depicts so skillfully i loved that the end did not provide closure despite the death of dwight that the reader is left with the open question of how dwight died jumped pushed and the unresolved future of the campbell family more","432":"bret anthony johnston is a tremendously talented writer as was clear from his previous short stories with remember me like this his capable writing skills have been matched up with a compelling plot the story is about the reappearance after several years of a missing teenager the story is told from the perspectives of the boys mother father grandfather and brother these characters reflect back on how they felt when he was missing and wrestle with how to move forward with their lives the characters are largely consumed with the question of how to live with the trauma do they try to ignore it do they need to or want to know all of the details no one is unchanged by the experience and it is impossible for them to pick up where they left off each of the characters needs to come to terms with this this is rich literary terrain and johnston avoids the easy answers","433":"what happens when a child disappears justin's family carried on always hopeful that he was alive someplace but when he returns held in emotions surface and the reunion is more complicated than predicted johnston does an excellent job presenting various perspectives as mother father grandfather brother and kidnapped son each deal with the dynamics of being reunited after one trauma that morphs into another type of trauma","434":"a compelling family story set on the gulf in texas the story begins four years after the disappearance of a family's older son 11 year old justin we get to know the characters to feel involved with what their lives are parents grandfather younger brother and then justin is found we never get inside justin or know very much about those four years though we do know some and suspect other things but watching this family deal with the return of this boy is very real very personal","435":"good read without a lot of the angst you would think would come with this topic","436":"four years ago justin campbell disappeared from his small home town of southport texas near corpus christi one day he was arguing with his younger brother griffin and the next he was gone his family has been searching day and night for him when one day four years after his disappearance his parents eric and laura receive a call that brings them rushing together at the corpus police station there they are reunited with their son from this point on the entire campbell family has to come together to overcome all that they have been through while the man who kidnapped justin dwight buford was arrested it does not stay that way and eventually the campbell family has to deal with the struggles of being lonesome even though they are all together while justin may be home it does mean that all of their struggles are over what i found really interesting about this book is how similar the story is to the new abc show the family at the beginning of this book i struggled to get into the story but the farther i got and the more i read the more i wanted to know about the final outcome what i really enjoyed about the book is that it didn't focus too much on justin himself i think the book focused equally on all of the characters and gave each one their own voice and own memories laura and eric struggle to not feel guilty over not trying hard enough to find their son griffin struggles to not feel guilty because he had a fight right before justin left the house and justin struggles to get over his anger at his family knowing that even though he has always been close they have always been looking for him i enjoyed the book but i definitely don't think i'll ever be reading it again i think someone into an intense story would really enjoy this book","437":"this was a quick pick from the library a good read and study on families and how each member of the family is impacted on many levels when there is a family tragedy then we see the outcome and realize that just because there is a positive one all the struggles and worries are not over love the family protection and attitudes of the grandfather in this story as well as the relationship between the brothers very moving and a good read try it","438":"citing wayne c booth's the rhetoric of fiction to address the relationship between art and morality and how a writer uses narrative distance to strike a delicate balance between author narrator character and reader nyt reviewer eleanor henderson lavishes praise on johnston's debut novel while it's true that he has crafted a truly beautiful work of fiction and has constructed each family member with care and compassion i have to admit that from a storytelling perspective i was just flat out disappointed by the end of the story i understand what he was doing and he did it deftly but the part of me that gets carried swiftly by the current of the story didn't feel that happening toward the end here from the perspective of one who analyzes literature i can readily admit that that's not the point that he effectively did what he set out to do perhaps it's that i am addicted to the sunday law and order svu marathons and that there is a part of me that laps up salacious details like a voyeur when i'm reading for pleasure i think the real point was to look at this family as a fault line one that shifts as a result of the earthquake that is justin's kidnapping it's not meant to be some sort of riveting courtroom suspense but rather an examination of a family's attempt to put itself back together in the wake of unspeakable tragedy still i'll be honest the last sixty pages dragged for me and generally that's where a reader expects to be carried along toward the finish line with a strong momentum in fact the most exciting part toward the end of the novel was in the acknowledgements where i saw mention of a former professor tim melley and my alma mater miami university had no idea the author had some sort of connection to people who have taught me and to the place where i was educated and after doing some research i see that he was pursuing his ma while i was there pursuing my ba it's a little crazy thinking that we may have crossed paths in bachelor hall and now here he is working as a director of creative writing at harvard while i may not have set my sights quite that high hehe","439":" this was a book i just happened to pick up at barnes and noble without much thought it was a very good book but the author specifically left out detail to keep the reader thinking i appreciate the approach but in this particular book i really wished for more from the author i enjoyed the character development very much and your heart really sits with each member of this family but the intrigue that i felt was never really satisfied it is a very well done by the author and i can certainly see it's national bestseller appeal but it wasn't one of my favorites","440":"a wonderful book i loved the way you learned about the case in small dollops just the way it would happen in real life","441":" the first quarter of this is so gob smackingly well written so taut and tense and tight plot wise and so nuanced and crisp and lovely prose wise that i would give it 4 to 5 stars in a skinny minute then the boy returns the author makes a laudable choice to not deal tabloid style with the ordeal of the missing boy while he was missing and another not to make a big absorbing character of the perpetrator what's on the table here is the ripples of trauma in and the search for a way forward by the family members who had been devastated by his disappearance and who expect to be neatly healed by his return for me some creakiness settled in then just some moments here and there where i found i was stepping outside the very well imagined and described world of the book that absolutely had me by the scruff at first and asking 'really that seems odd ' but on the whole it's a page turner and the characters beautifully drawn","442":"this booked dragged on forever","443":"loved this book read it slowly as i've been so busy but that didn't matter as i was gripped every time i had the chance to pick it up great descriptions of human emotion v well written also i am near the southport in england so i liked all the references to living in 'southport even if it was a different one","444":" i finished this book and have spent a day thinking how to review it it was a fascinating and realistic portrayal of a family in upheaval justin the oldest child of the campbells went missing four years ago each member has dealt with the tragedy in their own desperate way which is laid out in alternating perspectives when justin unexpectedly returns the family must figure out how to be a family while dealing with justin's mysterious past at times this book is heartbreaking but each character is trying to do the best thing for their family and justin this is one of the better books that i have read on the issue of child kidnapping that is both realistic and hopeful i received this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest review","445":"i was very interested in this book for the first half but the story dragged in the end was very unsatisfying","446":"3 and a half because it was somewhat bogged down with too much we heard about already and left us wondering about things we didn't","447":"heartwrenching","448":"sorry but this book just didn't have any depth to it","449":"johnston writes with a weightless elegance justin has been abducted and returns after 4 years it's a heavy topic and johnston explore not what happens but how each member of the family has been affected the author sees from each perspective and does this beautifully the story unfolds easily and keeps your attention all the way","450":" bret anthony johnston is a master storyteller see corpus christi his book of short stories each as beautifully written as this novel as a reader i love the premise of this novel how in fact does a family navigate the tricky waters of a child returning from an abduction his persona now changed by the life he experienced while away as a writer i love johnston's loving precision with words and sentence structure he is a classic wordsmith who knows his craft he makes me want to be a better writer highly recommended","451":"the problem with literary thrillers is they take to long to read so it is harder to suspend disbelief this is well written but i was skeptical of too much of it","452":"a thoroughly engrossing tale with to me a very disappointing ending one of those situations where i can't explain exactly why i felt let down but i did","453":" i received this book as a goodreads first read the campbells' eldest son justin went missing four years ago how can a family cope with the not knowing the hope that he still leaves or the fear that he is dead the family fractures each coping in individual ways until justin is found alive and comes home this is where the novel starts it looks at the effects of the enforced absence examines how the family fight to fit justin back into their lives repair the damage they have done to themselves and cope with the knowledge that his abductor has to face trial we never see life through justin's eyes in a clever move justin is always observed by his family who watch the changes his abduction has brought we never find out exactly what went on for the years he was held though there are hints and suggestions but they never come from the victim so we can never be sure the finale is played out as the menfolk in the family look to take revenge and this section almost like a thriller brings sensation to the human drama played out earlier a novel where the dark areas are sketched out not revealed and where hope is renewed an excellent and enjoyable read","454":"the story of a family whose son was kidnapped and found 4 years later the 1st half of the book held my attention you learn about how everyone was affected by the kidnapping but then the 2nd half just dragged on for me you never really learn how justin the kidnapped boy lived for 4 years","455":"a family apart brought togetherbook was fantastic the author does a great job or portraying how the disappearance affects each family member individually and then as an entire unit the same is done for when he is found i loved how it was know what was done to justin but it is not the main crutch of book rebuilding life is","456":" thank god i am done with this book you could have shaved off a good 50 pages of descriptive crap and had a plot instead you had page after page of useless analogies and description after description of mundane stuff flat and unreal characters and a story that never took off hovered above actually moving forward and ended equally disappointingly i have to give the author credit he's the director of creative writing at harvard and he didn't get there by accident but this book doesn't showcase what to me should be an exceptional grasp of plot pacing and character development","457":"beautiful story all the characters are likable this was a slow read for me i couldn't just breeze through the pages i feel like i have to take everything in page by page this was also for me not a hard to put down book i could stop reading when i wanted to but it was also something that was never difficult to pick up again and continue to read #bookclub","458":"this was one of the best books i've read in years johnston does an amazing job of combining the fast moving plot of a thriller with heart felt meaningful description that makes you want to savor each sentence i cannot recommend this novel enough or his short story collection corpus christi which also takes place in small town south texas as well","459":"a sad sad story that weaves it's way to not quite peace but to the certainty that security and happiness are in the moment so well structured the second book i've read this spring that i will not ever forget","460":"usually i like novels with an element of mystery but this one felt like it had a split personality and ultimately was insufficient as mystery or literature still three stars for an interesting plot and some really fine writing at moments","461":"justin campbell disappeared one day at the age of twelve then four years later he is recognized and rescued from his captor and brought home what happens next is a family's struggle to regain the familiar structure they once had and to deal with the changes in their lives and recover from this devastating ordeal this is the story of one family's dealing with the abduction and rescue of their son and how it affects each one of them this book is filled with emotions that go in all directions the author writes so that the reader can grasp each character's feelings without throwing in our faces he does a good job in telling this profound story","462":" bret anthony johnston where have you been all my reading life for a character based reader like me this luminous debut book is sheer manna from heaven it's certain to make my personal top ten list of 2014 the concept is deceptively simple an 11 year old boy named justin goes missing one day and is likely abducted his parents eric and laura and his younger brother griffin are all well liked in their corpus christi community they muddle their way through the four ensuing years coming apart personally and as a family and then no spoiler - it's in every book blurb justin is found and there's where the happy ending comes in except...it's not the genius of this author is that - without any manipulation - he closely examines what the granting of this fortuitous return really means to each of them the emotions are so real that the writing took my breath away take this description of his mother laura \"those four years had gutted her family how could she not understand such hideous gravity everywhere she looked the absolute and crushing weight of the past at times she'd been bloated with sadness leaden and unmovable other times she would have sworn she was a sieve \" and later \"life started to feel - what not normal not familiar inhabitable navigable \"there is not one false note in this book not one the writing is assured confident and clear eyed the characters are so real they could step out of the pages and the insights are organic and beautifully realized there are no huge surprises or \"drama for the sake of drama\" these are all good people regular and steady and seemingly unafflicted they're people who - in the aftermath of one of life's worst traumas-- take cautious and struggling steps to deal with a range of unexpected emotions and work mightily to make themselves whole again it's not the mythic hollywood ending to a kidnapping rather it's an achingly intimate view into the emotional canvas of a family damaged by circumstances beyond their control i simply cannot recommend this book highly enough i envy those who are starting it for the first time","463":"i finished this book a couple of days ago i had a hard time putting this book down it was that good i liked the way that this book was written in the point of view of the family left behind i felt that it was tasteful that they didn't go into detail about the abuse the characters were very likeable for the most part they each deal with the disappearance in their own way the mother was especially fragile i won this book on goodreads thanks for the great books i would have given it four and one half stars if this was a option","464":"better than average quick read novel looks at the impact on a family when a son returns home four years after being abducted good character development and pacing 3 stars","465":" 3 5 starsi think this was an exceptional look at the family dynamics after a child returns home from being kidnapped four years earlier this wasn't a riveting read more an interesting pensive look at a family devestated by justin's kidnapping at the age of 12 and what happens to them after he is miraculously found living with a man in a nearby town there is so much love guilt and finally appreciation that they experience this book was written from the perspective of justin his mother father brother and grandfather at times i didn't prefer this style of writing but i grew to appreciate the different ways each family member dealt with the difficulty of his kidnapping","466":"this book was just okay it had a promising beginning but they drug the plot for far too long too much description of how the characters were feeling","467":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here meh this is supposed to be a look at how a family deals with the disappearance and years later reappearance of one of their two sons but the characters are so vaguely drawn that it just doesn't work johnston is big on sending his characters to the same few places to set the mood there's the mother volunteering to care for a sick dolphin the grandfather's pawn shop griff and the rundown teepee motels but they read so clearly as attempts to set the mood that it's hard as a reader to belie meh this is supposed to be a look at how a family deals with the disappearance and years later reappearance of one of their two sons but the characters are so vaguely drawn that it just doesn't work johnston is big on sending his characters to the same few places to set the mood there's the mother volunteering to care for a sick dolphin the grandfather's pawn shop griff and the rundown teepee motels but they read so clearly as attempts to set the mood that it's hard as a reader to believe in any of these characters or the town itself the epilogue seems like a cheap addition to the novel 'what was my wife really doing all those nights she was supposedly volunteering at the dolphin center ' the husband wonders overall the pieces here just don't come together the way the family behaves the family itself just isn't believable more","468":"aftermathyears ago when we first had reason to consult a family therapist the first thing the man told us was always allow for the aftermath don't assume that a thing is over just because it appears to be wise advice but it is a subject you rarely see explored in literature until now bret anthony johnston has taken a disturbing event the sudden disappearance of an eleven year old boy from a normal american family delivered what seems to be a happy ending the boy's safe return after four years but refused to stop there almost 300 pages are still to come the aftermath this is a well written book that scarcely puts a foot wrong but it was not for me i could admire almost everything about it but not feel truly touched johnston's portrayal of the campbell family is detailed and never sensational when we first meet the father eric a history teacher he is having a meaningless affair laura his wife tries to find some purpose by volunteering in a dolphin rescue facility griffin the younger son is an obsessive skateboarder though he is also becoming involved with a goth girl called fiona the only character who is less than fully believable cecil eric's father is an ex con who runs a pawnshop in their depressed community in the corpus christi area his presence hangs over the novel like a thundercloud a distant threat of potential violence and justin the abducted boy himself is apparently normal when he comes back apart from his odd sleep patterns commendably johnston entirely avoids any sensationalism about his case whatever justin may have endured is between him the da and his therapist there is no mystery about his abductor either the book is entirely about how these five ordinary people can adjust to the sudden switchbacks in their lives and to the awareness of their own vulnerability in themselves and with each other as laura tells one of her co workers it's like we were all on a sinking ship and now we're each in our own lifeboat floating away from each other this is only one of the author's psychologically precise observations i see it as i say but didn't feel it--perhaps because i was dealing with some family issues of my own at the time but even that only increases my admiration for behind the extraordinary situation of the campbell family the author also touches on many of the subtle bonds and betrayals that exist in all marriages between all parents and their children johnston's slow development and accumulation of detail must surely be the work of a father and husband who knows family life and has the courage to set it down as it is all kudos to him for that that it seemed tedious to me and sometimes even excruciating probably says more about me than about the book several times i almost gave up but i kept on in the hope that such a fine author would not end with a message that was entirely bleak and indeed after a nail biting but never sensational climax he does reach a kind of equilibrium including a brief scene around the family dinner table that for the first time really moved me it was almost enough i find myself writing now far more positively than i ever thought i would while i was actually reading","469":"great and compelling read which gives an insight into the fallout from a child kidnapping surprising and realistic but never depressing","470":"i really wanted to like it i liked some parts but felt like other areas really dragged","471":"every parent's worst nightmare you think your child is safe in his room only to find he has disappeared without a trace did he run away was he kidnapped as the parents struggle to hold what's left of the family together they never give up hope that their oldest son will come home someday or do they each parent reacts in different ways and finds very different avenues to cope with the absence of the boy","472":" right from the start this book took me to uncomfortable places abduction a boy losing 4 years of his life a mother who can't recover a father who slinks away to his lover's bed whenever things get tough money problems among the things i love about this book are the ways the author creates a family how true and compelling that family is bret johnston is a fantastic writer you feel his grip on the wheel throughout the story i found myself wanting the sections with the grandfather to go away though almost like the grandfather's sections were there to provide structure to give rationale to the ending i felt the writer making a some self conscious decisions about how to link the elements of the story almost academically like the book was over written in some ways that doesn't get in the way of this being a remarkable story about damage and recovery and this is what i love most about hope i look forward to many more stories from this writer i am already a fan","473":"i received a free copy of this book from the goodreads first reads giveaways in exchange for an honest review terrific plot a real page turner would recommend","474":" this is a psychological portrait of a loving family festering over the disappearance of their son justin spolier alert when justin campbell is found in nearby corpus christi four years after he disappeared you might think all would be well but each family member still suffers in fact such suffering is what the book is all about maybe a bit much so at least for me parents eric and laura treat justin with kid gloves one thing that drove me crazy is why they never asked him he didn't just call home justin on some level harbors anger his family didn't find him sooner his younger brother griff lives in justin's shadow their grandfather cleans his guns especially when the kidnapper is let out on bail although i always enjoy deep character development here it seemed to circle round and round like a tornado that never lands some of the plot elements did not add up for me that said throughout most of the book i felt myself waiting for the other shoe to drop i am not sure it ever did things fell flat life goes on albeit with plenty of tortured love the campbells do deeply love each other and that was impressive plenty of writing skills here despite my gripes","475":"this book lured me in as a flawless nuanced story it disappointed me in both ways and many more aside the prose was stilted and downright awkward if you are using a sentence like he felt a feeling you probably need to go back to writing school sorry not sorry","476":"this is the story of a young boy who is kidnapped by a pedophile and the effect on his family when against all odds he is returned the psychological perceptions are acute and the writing is wonderful there are lots of unanswered questions why wasn't he found sooner what was his relationship with the kidnapper but that's okay there are unanswered questions in life too","477":" some books are suspenseful others are beautifully written this is both justin campbell went missing from his texas town when he was 11 years old his family never gave up looking for him and four years later he is found mostly the book focuses on the effects of his disappearance and reappearance on his parents younger brother and grandfather we really do not learn a lot of what actually happened with justin in those four years so our imaginations are free to think of the most hideous things and to hope that we are wrong fortunately i have never been in the situation of any of the main characters of the book but the thoughts and scenarios seemed entirely plausible to me the descriptive writing added to the enjoyment of the book although i've never been to texas the author made me see and smell the southport texas area its seacoast its weather its landscape its harbor bridge i will be looking for more books from this gifted author","478":"it is very well written with enjoyable characters it's a page turner and handles difficult subject matter in a digestible way","479":"interesting but somewhat predictable","480":"justin campbell was twelve years old when he went missing his parents and younger brother spent this time trying to deal with or in some cases not deal with the loss of justin then wonders of wonders he is found due to an observant lady who notices him and calls the police a man is arrested a pedophile who feeds on the young and a man who is the son of someone justin's grandfather knows it is here that the story really begins a family trying to put their lives back together brothers who must rediscover a bond guilt ideas of revenge and many other emotions that can affect a family and tear it apart is it possible to rebuild lives after such a horrible event will it ever be the same the ease of just being together how to keep the quest for justice from tearing everything wide open while the kidnapper does play an integral part not so much what he did to justin but just the fact that he exists it is more about this family their bonds their thoughts and actions i believe that this is the author's first book of fiction previously writing non fiction and he does a wonderful job he doesn't try with his prose to wring every last ounce of heartbreak out of his readers but presents the story very realistically at least i thought so after all the story itself the circumstances alone provide enough emotion arc from librarything and the publisher","481":" this book explores the struggles of a family after they find their son after he has been kidnapped for four years justin campbell is found after being kidnapped and their family is of course ecstatic upon his return each family member deals with their own emotions about his return each feeling some responsibility for his kidnapping and his prolonged absence from their lives it is at time awkward for them to be around justin making the guilt even stronger shortly after he is found the kidnapper is released on bail making the family more nervous feeling like they are being watched soon the father and grandfather devise a plan that may finally bring the family together or destroy them entirely","482":"this book did everything i want a book to do suspenseful narrative deeply flawed and realistic characters cutting away from the sensational to focus on the true clear story of aftermath i will read anything johnston writes","483":"this is a wonderful read a story of survival and healing not just for the victim of abduction but of the whole family upon his return bret anthony johnston is a true master of the written word","484":" this is a book perfect for book clubs there is so much beautifully executed language deft use of metaphor and genuinely well crafted characters that beg discussion every person is well crafted rather extraordinary in a book that centers upon the aftermath of a kidnapped boy's return to his family i feel almost guilty admitting that i wish i had enjoyed the book more while 'remember me like this' is a brilliant character study of a healing family it is not a thriller and the pacing is glacial at best","485":"dragged on and on","486":"reading the first 2 3 is like when you've got a nice buzz and you jump into a clear lake and open your eyes underwater and everything has a different light and is slow and you feel like you'll be in the present moment forever and reading the last 1 3 is when your animal brain kicks in and you start to swim as fast as you can to the surface turning pages turning pages to get the hell out of this book and and get away from these characters and their pain their failed remedies to assuage it which are too close and too true it's a book i'd give as a present and say i'm sorry ahead of time for what's going to happen to you while you read this but i know you'll forgive me because isn't it incredible","487":"ugh if you want to read a painfully naive book about a child being kidnapped and abused for 4 5 years and then returned this is the one for you it seems to me that very real and dark issues are ignored and replaced by pretty farfetched and unlikely complications that as a bonus just happen to sort of resolve themselves that being said i actually really liked the family members like able characters that i wanted to be ok","488":"this was a hard one to get through and i'm not really sure why i finished this one to the end i think i kept expecting it to pick up it really did seem to have a lot of promise so i was pretty disappointed when it just chugged along to the finish i was interested in the premise of this about a teen who's reunited with his family after being kidnapped for a few years but i was pretty much bored by the story it seemed a little dry i think and it just wasn't able to pick up any momentum i actually think i scanned the last 20 or so pages rather than actually reading them","489":"excellent writing characterization premise suspense detail a compelling read all the way through i had read in a review that the narrative was made up of multiple perspectives so i expected worried that my interest and investment would vary among the characters but i found that this wasn't the case i wanted to hear from all of them equally highly recommend","490":"i'm not just saying this because i'm starting a workshop with the author tomorrow but i thought this was a terrific book because we learn early on that the son of eric and laura campbell has been kidnapped we assume that it's going to be one of those books it is in a way but it's a lot more than that all of the characters seemed terribly real to me and i was especially impressed with the portrayal of the sons","491":"absolutely brilliant portrayal of a family surviving and recovering powerful subject matter blending with moving characters each persons perspective eloquently felt with clarity by the reader the pace of the narrative masterfully executed from the backstory to the present bravo johnston's stunning prose elevates the emotional impact of this novel in its entirety flawless debut by bret anthony johnston an author on my radar for future projects excellent novel fiction at its finest","492":"i liked the premies of this story but i was not a fan of the writing it was one of those books that rambles about feelings like a whole chapter just for a character to have internal monologue i know some people like that but its not for me i like a quick moving story which this wasn't","493":" i loved the narration felt it really conveyed the pace and atmosphere of a southern town in the heat of summer as well as how that really served as an image of the burden facing the family i also thought the author did a good job of reflecting the inner voices of each of the main characters i'll confess that like many of the other reviewers here i was disappointed in the ending but i wonder why we are so jolted by this kind of ending i don't want to put any spoilers here but i wonder if we are too influenced by how hollywood ends so many stories","494":" arguably my most surprising read of the year i did not think a book that followed the life of a family after their kidnapped son is found could be this riveting i read every word i skimmed nothing this was a powerful heartbreaking yet hopeful story you spend the majority of the book in the families' heads sometimes reading streams of consciousness the writing was absolutely gorgeous the plot realistic believable i wasn't depressed reading this and i was always ready to put this book down if it made me so i think it was because the characters struggled and fought to work through their fears and challenges the author did such an amazing job bringing them to life that i felt like i knew truly this family and was rooting for them as i turned the pages i have rarely seen characters this well drawn just wow amazing a great book","495":" is there anything worse for a parent than the death of a child this story is a grave reminder that yes yes there is something infinitely worse and it is the not knowing being a parent makes this a hard read striking at a terror we have all felt when turning around and discovering your child is not there trying to fathom four years of this anguish is beyond comprehension yet this author does an amazing job of giving you a taste of what that may feel like when you think about condemning the campbells for their thoughts or actions just for one second put yourself in their shoes and pray this is never you lototyreviewer for coffee time romance u0026amp moreofficial review @ coffee time romance u0026amp more","496":"this is a story about the campbell family which has been understandably in turmoil since the disappearance of their 14 year old son justin when he returns it is no surprise that the three year gap has changed everyone","497":"parents of two sons 12 and 8 live in texas one day the 12 year old goes out and is abducted he is rescued 4 1 2 years later the bulk of the book deals with the family and how they cope with being whole again very good story i was glued my only problem was the ending tied up in a a neat little package","498":"once i started this book it was difficult to put down imagine if you can your 11 year old son disappearing what would happen to your life while you search for him over the next four year and what would be the impact of of that son being found 4 years later tense heart rendering and nuanced this book holds your heart periodically squeezing it as you feel the impact of the losing and then gaining a son just one caution this book can be triggering view spoiler there is some discussion of sexual abuse of a child in this book hide spoiler","499":"engrossing read that avoids the trap of romantic melodrama that many of this genre fall prey to","500":"what would your life be like if your son went missing a nightmare that is what happens to this family a haunting story of guilt sorrow and hope they try to hold on each in their own way and have faith that he will come home but even after he is found life as they knew it will never be the same","501":"this book is so freaking good","502":"i'm all about character development but this was a little overkill even for me i'm not discounting the author's very real talent because he is a very good writer but it was just too much for me it seemed to drag with every single thought or feeling and i was ready for it to end about 100 pages before it did i also am skeptical of the family no family especially one in that situation could be that nice i find it hard to believe a family could click back together as easily as this one seemed to too perfect and clean what i really found lacking was information about the character who was the whole reason for the book we never get to hear anything from justin's point of view even just one chapter would have made the book seem more complete","503":"pretty depressing and drug on","504":"this book had the things i want most in a work of fiction likable realistic characters and a fast paced plot that engaged me instantly approachable but it never felt dumbed down this would make a great beach read it's hard to imagine anyone disliking this book","505":"johnston is another iowa writers' workshop graduate who gives us a great first novel the slow development nuanced character development and increasing emotional pitch combine with the frightening topic of child abduction compelling and satisfying","506":" yes people react violently to abuse and uncertainty and nothing is worse than a child missing or dead but the endless analysis of every word everyone said was irritating and while there are many clever images i felt somehow they were contrived to creative an impression and i didn't like sensing the author trying so hard to do this i get that texas is hot and sweaty with the images dark and foreboding until near the end the abrupt changes in the family when things happen to dwight were just too choppy at one point the analyses are halted while everyone enjoys the shrimporee except for eric in the epilogue where more analysis does at least show the author is creative to think of all these possibilities i didn't get into the characters much except justin himself and felt the author was trying too hard to make them believable","507":" a family's nightmare doesn't disappear when their lost son kidnapped at 11 recovered at 15 comes home instead it changes it ebbs and flows and each member of the campbell family has to refigure what feels wrong what feels right and where he or she fits into the whole bret anthony johnston's first novel has elements of mystery and even elements of thriller but its quiet nuanced sense of character both within the troubled campbell family and moving in and out of its orbit makes remember me like this much more","508":"this seemed to me to be a fair honest and realistic depiction of the physical and emotional trauma various family members experience when one of their own is lost i liked the pace which was somewhat like that of a thriller or suspense novel","509":" i'm going to have to give this between 3 and 3 5 stars the blurb promises that this is a gripping novel with the pace of a thriller but it sure doesn't deliver on that it's definitely a well written novel with lots of delving into the minds of the family members that are dealing with first the disappearance of their son and then his reunion with them but the pacing is very very slow i was also very disappointed in the lack of any real characterization of justin and i found it hard to believe that he would be so calm and collected once he was returned to his family after all the horrible things that were rumored to have happened to him at the hands of his kidnapper one would think that he would act out a lot more be a lot more angry be a whole helluva lot more withdrawn yet he seemed to be almost too good of a teenager one that was well adjusted and well loved quiet shy and well spoken not a boy who'd been held captive for four years subjected to sexual attacks and threatened with the deaths of his family if he ever tried to escape i would really have liked to have gotten in justin's head not just his mother's and father's and brother's just to see how he truly felt about the whole thing both the abduction and his return this is also a very long book there are long meandering passages about his mother's feelings and his father's feelings and while they're very well written and interesting at least the first few passages are they quickly turn very long and tedious recommended for someone who enjoys emotional thrillers but not necessarily for someone who needs a bit more action to balance out all the navel gazing","510":"an achievement in characterization with one frustrating flaw -- i could not at all believe the teens in this book they behaved much too mature and grown up especially griff who is supposed to be about 13 his thought process dialogue justin and fiona's as well did not fit it was necessary for the development of the story but unbelievable and so much of this book was about sharing emotions that feel true to life","511":"this is the story of a family whose older son goes missing at age 11 and is located and returned 4 years later the book deals with what the family has been through and their struggle to return to normal i liked the device the author uses to tell the story through the perspectives of the family members although it was interesting that he chose not to speak through the child that went missing at times i found the emotions expressed by the characters to be repetitious although i'm wondering if that may have been intentional i imagine anyone who has gone through something this horrific would obsess and fixate on the same thoughts over and over again i received this book for free through goodreads first reads","512":"one of the reviews i read stated my feelings to a t beautifully crafted and so suspenseful you cannot look away this is a novel as much about what is hidden as what is revealed i read this page turner in 2 days","513":"awful i'm so made at whoever told me to read this","514":"simply couldn't get into this book found it to be overly dramatized not necessarily predictable but definitely could expect the occurrences i was reminded of some of the llama drama hollywood mysteries such as before and after","515":"johnston's characters are psychologically compelling but his project getting inside what happens to a family when a son is abducted and abused then found is less so","516":"boring dull and frustratingly lacking development i kept expecting something to happen but i might as well have just read the dustjacket it was not horrible but reading this was a pointless and joyless experience in the end and who the heck writes an epilogue about all the things that could have possibly happened in the story but didn't not cool","517":"this is the best book i've read in a long time told from multiple perspectives each feels honest and unique the location and weather become another character ominous and oppressive there are no easy answers in the dilemma of the plot or in the relationships between the characters i read a few very good books after this one but they seemed mediocre in comparison it took me a long while to shake the beauty of this one from my mind and my expectations","518":"often unpredictable and never obvious very involving story","519":"i couldn't put this book down","520":"this novel had a cast of vivid and unique characters and the author does a brilliant job of pacing the story at times i felt as if i were floating above this family watching their days and years in a fluid and rich fast forward seamlessy the action slows and focuses with acuity on individual family members we see how each family member copes with the disappearance of eldest son justin their individual guilts grief and struggles deeply human the suspense does seem to lag mid way which was frustrating but there are some nice twists at the end for a good save","521":"interesting read maybe good for a book club i liked some of the characters enough to really think about them after reading well written","522":"this is a very powerful book chronicling a family dealing with the kidnapping of their son and then his return after 4 years the writing is pretty stellar early on there were bits that bordered on over written but that was only before i really got a feel for the pace of the novel the characters are all well drawn and complex all facing complicated decisions and heart wrenching situations to deal with there are a lot of places a novel like this could have gone wrong but somehow it never does there were a lot of different ways that i imagined this book ending and then just as one of them started to come into view it took a big left turn before winding up somewhere else i hadn't seen it going","523":" i just couldn't get into this story after reading jaycee dugard's autobiography of her kidnapping i guess that all else pales hence the reason it took so long to finish it i had to renew it twice from the library i didn't really care for any of the characters in this book they were all so self absorbed and continually running away from the issues duh in this day and age getting counseling for mental health abuse issues is not a big deal i am so constantly distressed by authors who write about serious issues i e sexual abuse and the characters don't seek out counseling really of course then there may not be a story i would rather read an uplifting account of someone who actively sought help and how it helped there situation it would certainly be more useful information i found this book to be depressing and it just dragged on forever","524":"story of justin who has been missing for 4 years and his return to his family all the ups and downs of his re establishing his relationship with his parents and siblings but something dark from justin's abduction lurks around the corner","525":" before i started reading i wondered how i could enjoy a book on this topic and i worried that i would find out more than i wanted to know about what happens to this young boy when he is abducted and kept prisoner for years i should not have worried the book was utterly engrossing and lovely in a tender and large hearted way that had nothing prurient or salacious about it each character is fully rendered and unique and we feel for how they each struggle to cope with grief and fear this will be a book i read again in a years time","526":"i appreciated that this book chose to skip the sordid details and neatly avoided a few hasty cliches ultimately it felt unfinished to me although i did enjoy it seems like the kind of book that could use a sequel","527":"the only good thing to come out of this book is that i discovered my audio app can be set to read 2x faster i kept holding on hoping it became better no dice","528":"loved every daunting honest part i had to go back and reread sections because the author gave such thrilling suspenseful hints through the characters' pov [?][?][?]","529":"son justin disappeared 4 years ago after he is found each family member deals with guilt that he or she was te reason he was taken worry about what cruelties jstin endured worrying about te kidnapper returning ad hurting the family again how to return to a normal family i liked the book but i didn't find it thrilling","530":"i usually think of depression as a cold thing but in remember me like this it is oppressive heat set in the fictional town of southport texas near corpus christi on the gulf coast bret anthony johnston conveys a languid tension in a family in a small town that has experienced tragedy a child has disappeared the family is broken eric and laura campbell's oldest son justin has been missing for four years eric laura and their other son griff have spent those four years searching for justin not knowing whether he is alive or dead four years from when he disappeared and they don't know if they should stop what has felt like a fruitless search or continue if only to find their son's body as well as conveying the brokenness of the family johnston seemed to capture each family member's own grief signature laura's energy for her family fading into passion for a rescued dolphin eric's inability to confront his own lack of strength and griff's life in his brother's fractured shadow trying to be careful not to mention or emulate his missing brother too much how does a family live as hope deteriorates i loved the atmosphere of the book tension and guilt and fear and depression and hope and heat johnston makes each character come believably alive having never experienced the awful disappearance of a child as well as the unknowing of the lost child's fate many times as i was reading i had the thought that this is what it must feel like the book begins with the family four years into justin's disappearance about a third of the way into the book i read the back cover which told a major plot point i wish i had not seen that plot development before it happened in my own reading this is one of those books i think it's better not to know too much about it's a gift to be part of the unfolding these characters and this story will be with me for a long time check out other blog posts here notthenewyorktimesbookreview blogspot com","531":"imagine killing a man the commitment the irreversible and unspeakable isolation in its wake with a line like that you know this is a well written novel i almost didn't read this book i have a hard time with books where a child is kidnapped that is my biggest fear as a mom i would have missed a very good read this story is really about the adjustment a family faces when a victim comes home not only do you hear from justin but you hear the story told through the eyes of the mom dad brother and grandad how each of these characters react and the guilt each of them face is very heart wrenching and so real it is a very tragic engrossing tale that you can't stop reading 5 out of 5 stars","532":" this is the story of a family whose son is missing for four years it's very well written and told from the perspective of the boy's parents brother and grandfather their accounts of the loss are heart wrenching and at times difficult to read and imagine i would have liked to read justin's account of what happened to him it feels that this was not a a story about justin rather than a story of his family that is probably what the writer intended but it did make for some frustration there were times when i wished that the story would move along a little more quickly but all in all it was a very good read","533":" reading bret anthony johnston's remember me like this brought me back to 2003 when kidnap victim elizabeth smart was released after eight months in captivity i was teaching a course in journalism ethics and i asked my students to assess the media coverage which included 24 7 speculation about why smart hadn't escaped earlier and what horrors she'd been subjected to that led to a vigorous debate over the conflict between the right to privacy and the public's right to know i argued that in this case there was no right to know only prurient interest and morbid curiosity not everyone agreed and certainly not cable news if only anthony's novel had been available then it would have been assigned reading it's the perfect answer to media callousness remember me like this is the story of a family trying to cope with a miracle--the return of 16 year old justin campbell four years after he left the house with his skateboard and did not return the search for him has consumed the family and much of the small texas town where they live the family never stops looking but their efforts are all in vain until a flea market vendor recognizes the boy and calls the police it turns out justin has been held all this time in nearby corpus christi imprisoned by a shadowy misfit but allowed enough freedom to play with other kids he even had a girlfriend why justin hasn't tried to escape and what unspeakable abuse he's been subjected remain unknown to the family and to readers justin doesn't volunteer much and his parents and his younger brother griff have been instructed by justin's therapist not to ask they are all too glad to obey more important the author takes the same advice john_9780812971880_cvr_all_r2 inddthat's because this isn't the story of justin's time in captivity it's the story of his family trying to return their lives to normalcy in a small town where everyone knows what happens and where everyone now wants to treat justin like a celebrity with well meaning acquaintances asking for his autograph but never for details his return isn't the end of the story it's just the beginning of another one the family has a lot of work to do it's been shattered by the kidnapping with mother laura withdrawing to spend her nights monitoring an ailing dolphin father eric finding moments of solace in the arms of another woman and brother griff grappling with misplaced guilt blaming himself because he and justin had argued just before justin left the house the family's attempts to adjust after justin's return are described with remarkable sensitivity and insight we feel for them as much now as we did when justin was missing they don't know how to adjust and at first each goes about it in his or her own way eric tries to get closer to justin by teaching him how to drive while laura devours books on the stockholm syndrome and griff tries to prove he can be as unhappy as he thinks justin is while each deals with his own guilt and regrets--and they all have plenty--they must learn anew how to relate to one another because they're all different people now especially justin johnston who directs the creative writing program at harvard has worked hard to get inside the heads of laura eric and griff as well as justin's caring grandfather and he succeeds in intimate detail i can't remember a book fiction or nonfiction in which i came away with a better understanding of the characters' though processes but johnston wisely eschews justin's point of view so that we like the rest of the characters in the novel never get more than fleeting indications of what he is thinking feeling or suffering in an interview with national public radio johnston says he intentionally kept his distance from justin and particularly from the details of his years in captivity it was a conscious move i really didn't include it because i wanted to respect the character i wanted to spend most of the time on the page with his family and not with what had happened to him i understand that the reader is going to be curious about it but i didn't leave it out for any kind of tactical reason i think the information is in the book it's just there in small obscure kind of off the page ways at one point in the novel griff works up the courage to ask justin what life was like in captivity \"is that a clever way of asking if he raped me \" justin responds griff denies it but he knows he's lying and hates himself for wanting to know as johnston notes readers will be curious but like griff we will hate ourselves for it i think johnston deserves a lot of credit for knowing when to be silent if only the media could learn the value of such restraint life might be just a tad bit easier for other victims","534":"this was a struggle to finish although it's billed as a thriller it doesn't have the same fast pace as most instead it concentrates on what's happening in minute detail to the family whose oldest son goes missing for four years only to be discovered living in the same city there is enough drama to keep the reader going but only if you're persistent and curious about what happens at the end","535":"the writing u0026amp language are great but the story was elusive to me it could've been great but didn't quite work for me u0026amp i found the building climax implausible toward the end i just wanted to be done with it","536":"what happens to a family when the kidnapped older son returns after four years there are huge gaps in their life together and in spite of the joy a great sense of pain and loss i really liked reading this book so much that i read it in under 4 hrs i just couldn't stop until i knew the outcome","537":"i haven't read this and don't know how to remove the stars some friends i respect have it on their to read lists though so i'll add it to my infinitely long one as well","538":"i wish fortunate to be asked to do an early review of this book i'm happy to say this book was great it caught my attention from the first few pages and had my attention throughout i highly recommend reading it","539":"very realistic that it was disturbing not a happy read but definitely educational on the fallout from loss all kinds of loss","540":"started out very gripping but didn't stay that way","541":"well paced and captivating","542":"forced myself to finish although was bored almost entire way through author created an amazing story line idea but failed to put any true life into the story truly disappointed at the end and surprised that it somehow made it onto the nytimes notable book list","543":"i love this book beautiful characters in a heart breaking story lovingly told","544":"eight things you can find in remember me like this1 a nuanced and well thought exploration of grief and loss it is the story of the campbell family whose eldest son justin was kidnapped it chooses to focus the majority of its time on what happens after justin returns home how does a family that has been so brutally wounded begin to recover 2 a pet snake named sasha as someone with a near phobia of snakes i didn't find the parts with sasha slithering under the covers to be very charming 3 very flawed characters i found the father eric to be a thundering asshole about 50% of the time but he was a very well developed asshole with believable fears about his ability to be a capable father and husband if i had to choose a character i liked best it would be laura the mother she clings to hope so tightly years of excruciating waiting have made her fragile and unstable she's also an avid reader who loves animals yes even that stupid pet snake rant time view spoiler eric dumbass that he is finds bottles of xanax and valium belonging to laura now at this point in justin's disappearance they are almost strangers laura spends her time caring for sick marine life while eric fucks another woman when he finds bottles of benzos does eric think to ask laura about it leave them be since their son is gone without a trace and laura is clearly not well nope the dumb fuck flushes most of them down the toilet first he is not her doctor he has no damn right second don't flush pills it goes straight into the water supply if you have pills you need to get rid of ask your pharmacy if they have a takeback disposal program surrender them to the police dept or mix them with coffee grounds and seal them inside a plastic container before chucking them in the trash third benzo withdrawal can kill you he has no idea what her dosage is like going cold turkey off of something like xanax is really dangerous hide spoiler 4 a sweltering summer setting in southport texas it's currently 7deg here with a foot of snow in my front yard i would welcome a little texas heat right now 5 up to par writing it's not flowery or dramatic the word choice acts to service the characters and their emotions it works for this type of story where connecting with the characters and giving a damn about their psychological trials is crucial 6 this quote \"the past was a bridge that looked solid and sturdy but once you were on it you saw that it extended only far enough to strand you to suspend you between loss and longing with nowhere to go at all \"7 use of sick as a slang word with zero explanation as to why is this the 80s the 80s with cell phones are we done reliving the 90s and i missed it 8 vengeance and people who are overly fixated on it what happened to justin was horrible to understate things but to go after dwight's parents a sick old woman on oxygen they had nothing to do with it view spoiler i'm not broken up about dwight's death though i completely agree with laura on that note i hope he suffered hide spoiler sidenote the book mentions that they want to seek the death penalty against dwight however i thought that only murder was punishable by capital punishment in the state of texas is the internet wrong about something help alice sebold said in remember me like this johnston presents an incisive dismantling of an all too comforting fallacy that in being found we are no longer lost she's nearly dead on it's a good novel about family what it means to be found and the million tiny losses we endure this was a freebie from goodreads firstreads thanks goodreads","545":"a well written book the story deals with the abduction of a boy and the struggles the family has to deal with when the boy returns several years later it is a very slow read and at times repetitive but nevertheless an interesting read","546":" i received this book as part of the goodreads giveaway and wanted to write a review to thank the author for making this book available i think this book would make a better book club book than just a stand alone book because so many of the problems i had with the characters may or may not have been a problem for someone else i struggled with the family not communicating with each other or seeking outside help after or during such a traumatic experience that might be the normal response but it felt very odd to me and it would be interesting to hear other readers opinions about the story i couldn't give it a 3 just because i don't feel like i can recommend it to just anyone to read","547":"amazing book that takes place is south texas an 11 year old boy disappears and unbelievably he is found four years later having been abducted and kept in corpus christi only an hour away the characters are unforgettable especially the younger brother and the mom heart rendering and compelling","548":"haunting and achingly beautiful remember me like this is possibly my favorite novel this year","549":" perfect book for a hot summer day or days the story unfolds slowly there is no rush or thrill seeking the campbell family despairs at the disappearance of their oldest son then they rejoice in his return but remain uncertain how to proceed all is different now that four years have elapsed the family's struggle to move forward as a family is beautifully rendered each character mom dad younger brother grandpa moves cautiously afraid to shatter the illusion that they remain a family even though the four year gap of justin's absence remains ever present in their psyches the writing is spare evocative and emotionally true i can feel the ache and the persistent sorrow present in this family throughout","550":"i will admit it took me awhile to finish this book not because it was boring because it had so much going on i didnt want to miss anything the beginning was a bit slow for me but took off and gets 4 stars johnston sure does know how to twist a story how do you move forward when you dont know what just happened strong emotions through out this read","551":" my view this narrative opens with a great hook - the discovery of a body on the very first page plants an image and a scenario that stays with you while you journey through this story and what a story this is it is quietly spoken honestly written and so so powerful this is a superb character study of pain and hurt and grief and love johnston explores the intimate reactions to every parent's worst nightmare - the taking of a child this novel is so simply written so personal it peeks into the life of a family in chaos their emotions strung tight and fraying around the edges ready to snap it explores grief and guilt and family dynamics under strain the fissures are wide and gaping the hurt bleeds through the pages how does anyone survive this type of trauma how do you move past the damage to reconstruct your family when the missing returns and how does the victim survive the damage inflicted upon him this is such a painful yet powerful expression of emotions that lay bare to an internal struggle that defies you to put yourself in this position and question how you would react i loved this writing it concentrates on the reactions of the family and the victim and does not give a voice or power to the abuser a wonderfully fresh perspective and the ending is guaranteed to surprise i look forward to reading more by this author","552":" while this book is every parent's worst nightmare an abduction of a child the story is primarily character studies of a family's healing following the son's return the viewpoints alternate between the father mother sibling and grandparent each drawn extremely well and with great empathy i cared about them all of course i identified most with the mother i have two sons and was riveted to her methods of coping thoughts of despair and struggles to maintain normalcy for the benefit of the other family members i also especially loved the grandfather i bought this many months ago on the recommendation of one of my favorite booksellers then i dreaded reading it because of the subject matter while the surviving son is depicted and interacts with the family on his return the author never uses his voice in any chapters throughout the book the details of the time away and the abuse is never divulged from the victim's perspective it is only lightly touched upon in the book this story is more about the love of a family and the struggle to survive this horrific time period they have to make some really difficult choices i liked the ending and had been apprehensive in the final chapters well written character studies i would definitely read other books by this author","553":"captivating in the beginning but i felt like it was slow and drawn out i found myself skipping ahead a few times as a new mother i wasn't sure i'd be able to read it but no graphic or gory details were included just the after effects and struggles from each family member's view","554":"overall i thought it was a very good book it wasn't boring by it also wasn't exciting i didn't really like the ending because it didn't satisfy me i guess it was a interesting though","555":" great story easy read wanted to always get to the next section or page hard story but very well told and from all angles interesting how people's lives can be changed due to one event and how it can effect everyone so differently felt closes to the character laura being a mother but could relate to cecil and the road he was willing to go down to help the family heal eric the dad was dealing with everything very differently then his wife griff lobster was the most interesting as to his feelings before during and after and the responsibility he took as to being a confidant to his brother but relaying information to his parents too and fiona loved her character and that she really watched out for griff and was his escape","556":"suspenseful and agonizing this novel was one of my best reads of the summer what seem like a series of scattered observations at the beginning of the narrative weave themselves into the tapestry of symbol conflict and character that made this book such an engaging read at core this is a story about what a family endures during and after trauma but the author leaves the reader plenty of room to inquire never offering easy answers to the issues broached","557":"well written but slow moving and about a quarter of the way through i thought we're not going to actually find out what happened to the kid while he was kidnapped are we nope you never do find out i get it it's not the point of the story but the family's reaction to his return overall i found underwhelming okay but not a great read","558":"strangely gripping portrait of a family in crisis","559":"if you had a child who was kidnapped and then years later returned wouldn't you live happily ever after not necessarily so and here is a lucid description of one family's journey in this situation we see everyone's point of view and the gradual post traumatic isolation as they all go spinning off into their own orbits then begin to recover or do they","560":"spot on","561":"i enjoyed the book almost up to the end stories like this never end happily ever after and perhaps this one does not i was dissatisfied with the end","562":"well handled story of family whose 11 year old son is kidnapped and found alive after four years his parents and younger brother want to comfort protect and love him but there are so many questions they dare not ask and so many feelings at the very raw surface of their lives his re entry is not smooth not a book for everyone because it will leave you emotionally exhausted","563":" this would have been a five star book until about 3 4 of the way through i found it very thoughtful and well written and telling the story from different points of view gave it nuance and kept it interesting this is all on the back of the book so not a spoiler if felt like a very realistic presentation of what would happen to a family whose child disappeared and then four years later reappeared having been living with his kidnapper not far from his home i read some reviews that complained that nothing happened but i thought that a lot happened not a lot of action but there was lots going on in this family mostly in their heads i like plot driven thrillers as much as the next person but a great story does not need to have a lot of action to be great but then the book took what to me was a weird turn probably in service of the need for thrillers to have twists and turns the book went from very realistic to what felt very unrealistic to me view spoiler hide spoiler the kidnapper gets released from jail on bail and the family freaks out first of all pedophile kidnappers who clearly did the crime do not generally get released on bail and certainly not to their family who lives nearby to the kidnapped kid with the freedom to come and go as they please it just wouldn't happen and then the father and grandfather come up with some kind of plan to do away with him i didn't buy it given everything we knew about them i didn't believe they would risk the future of this fragile family on such a scheme certainly not the father and it was a really stupid plan for which they would most certainly have been caught maybe even killed it didn't feel true to me to the rest of the story i was relieved when they didn't need to go through with it and it redeemed the story somewhat for me but i would have preferred that they decided not to do it not that it became unnecessary except for that little interlude i really liked this book and would recommend it","564":"this was one of those hard reads but such a good book a child abducted a family torn apart after years missing the boy is found and then the family tries to mend the brokenness of all of them this was written so well you can just feel the heartbreak on every page","565":"this is a novel about a boy who goes missing for 4 years he has 2 parents and younger brother who miss him and continually search for him the boy is found and the book is about what happens afterwards between the family members the kidnapper and the small town i thought the writing in the book was realistic but a bit too melodramatic for me","566":"very good mystery psychological drama about an abducted boy who is returned to his family","567":" i am not a big fan of books about mothers of missing children there are so many out there they should probably have their own section in the bookstore they're all the same the child is kidnapped or maybe goes missing on the way to the corner store and the rest of the book consists of the mother's angry self pitying inner monologues with plenty of sleepless nights and maybe an eventual affair with the crusty but caring detective assigned to the case the mystery of what happened to the child and if he or she will be found alive isn't usually enough to get me through all the shrill hand wringing because that's not why we show up to read is it i don't want to trudge through somebody else's worst nightmare if all i'm hearing is the voice of the person who knows the least about what's going on that's why i loved remember me like this--it's so much more than just the story of a mom whose son has been kidnapped it's about an entire family and how far they will go for justice johnston gives us his story from so many different angles all of them fascinating all of them devastating justin disappeared at age eleven the family he left behind did everything they could to find him papering their corpus christi suburb with flyers organizing search parties through the dunes taking out a second mortgage on the house to offer a reward for his return still all their efforts turned up nothing but thin air four years later the impossible justin has been found alive just miles from home his parents laura and eric shocked back to life by his return are instructed not to press justin about what happened during his captivity their younger son griffin is thrilled to have his brother back but he often doesn't know what to say or how to act around him eric's father cecil also figures prominently a fount of simple wisdom and righteous anger i'm having a hard time describing him in a way that doesn't make him sound like a cliche but he's not trust me justin's sudden return is only the beginning everyone has so many questions and not one of them has an easy answer what happened to justin while he was being held why didn't he try to get away if the case goes to trial will the man accused of taking him go to jail will he be able to hurt justin again what could they have done to prevent the abduction will justin ever be able to live a normal life after suffering such an ordeal will any of them it's those questions that make up the bulk of the book and they're what kept me reading late into the night each character is realistically drawn so clearly teetering on the edge of control that the suspense just builds and builds every single member of the family seemed capable of anything i read the final pages with my heart in my throat more book recommendations by me at www readingwithhippos com","568":"i found this book to be both disturbing and compelling disturbing from the perspective of being a mother and thinking about how you would react if this happened to your family the compelling part comes from the writing it is written like a literary novel but paced like a thriller the mix is my perfect mix of genres i loved the characters and felt they were very authentic the book leaves you wondering but it was the perfect ending highly recommend reader received a complimentary copy from library thing early reviewers","569":"i am a little surprised at how many really good reviews there are for this book i had some somewhat high expectations for this one i was left feeling bored and uninterested in any of the characters including the boy who was kidnapped there were so many descriptive details of unimportant things descriptions of clothing items on a table etc and not enough depth to the emotional upheaval that would come after a kidnapped child one who has been gone for multiple years has been returned to his family so little was provided about what the kidnapped boy experienced who the kidnapper was that it was impossible to consider what it would be like to endure things for four years then go back to a normal life the whole point of this book seemed to be an exploration into what it would be like to return together as a family after that kind of trauma but the author fell incredibly short","570":"if you start reading this book during the work week make sure you've got vacation or sick leave available","571":"a young 12 year old boy disappears he is presumed kidnapped or dead one day he is returned to his family happily ever after absolutely not each member of the family especially the kidnapped youth has his or her own demons to overcome the debut author deals with each family member in an amazingly clear way i could feel their emotions wonderful book","572":"a beautifully written yet painful story of a family attempting to find their way after a horrible tragedy turns miraculous what i loved most about this book was the way johnston revealed bits of detail like peeling an onion slowly and meticulously a story was told but in gorgeous and sparing prose a refreshing change of pace from the tell all the gory details storytelling method","573":"remember me like this is a novel that tracks a family after the shattering experience of justin the eldest son going missing justin has been gone so long that he is presumed dead the family can not allow themselves to voice their fears to each other lest they increase the others' angst i was impressed that the story did not over sensationalise the ordeals of the family or their reactions to people situations conversations etc i enjoyed the side story of the developing romance love story of griff the son remaining with his parents and fiona this showed that life and happiness can still be developed and obstacles overcome the story lacked pace at times and required a conclusive ending","574":" this is the story of what happens after the happy ending a missing boy is finally returned years later to the family that never stopped looking for him yea but then what what are their lives like how do their family dynamics shift how do they endure the scrutiny that accompanies the arrest of the kidnapper while i came to like the parents and grandfather the younger son griff was by far my favorite character he was such a good kid though imperfect and he was trying so hard to be the son and brother his parents and sibling needed through this difficult time justin the boy who was kidnapped is drawn in less detail but that's ok i liked that the author provided this kid some privacy i don't need to know exactly what horrors he endured in captivity this is a novel not the nancy grace show i can imagine that he'd be reticent to share these details with his family and i was ok with not learning them there was a moment a small moment that hit me hard that gave me a window into the rage turbulence he was dealing with and it had to do with the pet mice his mother doted on that's all i'll say you'll get no spoilers out of me he may have been returned to his home and his old life but he's forever changed they all are","575":"missing kid don't know who knows what turns out close two brothers anguish of parents had lines like picoult usually has for me so profound had to stop reading to contemplate so true to what parenting really is steve thodes pick of the year kenyon had but hasn't read loved it","576":"as a mother of two sons this was tough to read and think about one can never imagine what they would do if confronted with this situation wow vague at times and sometimes verbose but very thought provoking an emotional roller coaster loved the pov transitions","577":"remember me like this is part mystery and part family drama the excellently written story by bret anthony johnston tells of the disappearance of justin campbell and the destruction it has on his family the narrative is told from multiple points of view but offers little insight into justin's thoughts thankfully the book doesn't go into explicit details of what happened to justin during his supposed kidnapping i just wish the book had focused more on justin's feelings i think that would have made the story more effective in telling the tale of survival in spite of tragedy","578":"very well written book looking at the aftermath of the return of a kidnapped boy after four years","579":"couldn't put it down but it's not a thriller or mystery the way the previews suggest it's subtle and gentle and devastating highly recommended","580":"really good till near the end then wait what the end is vague and a bit of a let down up until the end i would have given it 4 stars it gets only 3 for the ending","581":" the following review contains what might be perceived as a spoiler but all the blurbs about the book contain the same spoiler and it occurs quite early in the novel this is a taut emotional novel about the impact of having a child missing and then found after four years now age 14 the story is heart wrenching feels authentic and is written with considerable empathy we are privy to the raw emotions challenges life changes and psychological journey this family endures following both the loss and the return of their son a thoroughly engaging read","582":"excellent book touching story how a family deals with a child who goes missing i found it very moving as it went into each family member's emotions and thoughts","583":"this book was a little slow in parts but only because it was so thorough and deliberate i feel like i know every member of the family i loved it","584":"this was brilliantly written and the first half was totally engrossing loved it the characters the emotion the realism were all just spot on then the second half although equally well written just dived although i'm sure a very accurate accounting of the journey and emotions a family placed in this situation would go through it just didn't captivate it became repetitive and after the first half you just wanted more disappointing but only because the start was so fabulous would love to read one of his other novels","585":" http oneblogtwobroads com 2015 02 1 11 year old justin campbell goes out to skateboard and disappears the family is devastated there are years of searches and tears eric his father begins an affair laura his mother spends her time watching over a dolphin at sea lab and young griff tries to continue his life and even has a girlfriend but that hole is always there then they get the phone call justin has been recognized at a local flea market life takes another turn for the campbell family they find out he was taken by a local man and has been nearby the whole time as they try to sort out their various feelings of joy anger sadness frustration can they begin the process of healing this was a very dark book at times that was interspersed with little rays of hope they all walk on eggshells around each other hoping to learn the truth but maybe really not wanting to know it at all sometimes i just wanted to reach in and hug one of them i couldn't say this would be for everyone because the storyline might be too harsh for some but i had to keep reading and hope that there would be redemption for all of them and that they could and should forgive themselves","586":"fantastic read read this book in just a few days not something that happens for me often given my schedule friends from corpus would find the location references so accurate that you feel transported back regardless of where you may be at the moment","587":"devastating subject matter but excellent engaging storytelling it was definitely a page turner the author was so emotionally insightful it's hard to believe it was written by a man the characters were so honest i was really impressed with the psychology in this book","588":"i received this book as a goodreads giveaway i will remember this remarkable book for a long time the author engaged me from page 1 to the end the book was well written with interesting complex characters","589":" i will remember this book and if i could give it more than 5 stars i would the narrative taps in to so much that we all dread and does it in such a clever and considered way that it becomes a treasured journey alongside striking companions it reminded me in some ways of the under read novel by joseph heller 'something happened' in that in exploring an extraordinary event through the hearts and minds of ordinary people something profound is created the language used is sturdy and not in any way lyrical and provides a strong platform for the reader and the protagonists to walk upon without the author drawing any attention towards himself and his powerful writing he allows the subjects to build throughout the novel into real people very worthy of our attention and our time johnston never puts a foot wrong and i was pulled along turning the pages without pause towards a satisfying and tear inducing conclusion mrs sheppard i salute you what i loved most about the book was that the perpetrator of what must rank high on the list of most cruel crimes is never handed power dwight bruford is a dark shadow throughout but he is never handed the wheel never written up to shock or to gain a hold to become a powerful bogeyman he is there as pathetic mean and unworthy it is the ordinary mixed up and messed up loving and fearing characters who star and who are written with such a sense of solidity that i fear for the author in having such knowledge of human emotion and relationships but hope that he writes much much more i was given a copy of this book via netgalley in return for an unbiased review and i am so glad that i signed up because i may not otherwise have encountered a new favourite author","590":"beautifully written enjoyed the characters was never quite sure how it would end","591":"this book had all the potential to be awesome but never quite made it i couldn't put it down but i feel very unsatisfied","592":" i usually do not seek out books about the topic of missing and exploited children due to my work they are not an escape for me i started the book more as a mystery read i loved the author's language particularly describing the mother's emotional journey in experiencing a loss this year there was one section that screamed to me yes there it is in words that is how i feel especially in a room full of people oddly though the family remains disconnected in their private discussions regarding the abuse while not broaching the subject with the victim and leaving this area to the therapist it seemed that the rest of the family all remained isolated dealing with it in solitary ways a good read in general","593":"wonderful the haunting story of a family in which a son who had been abducted returns moving exploration of the ways such a crime wounds everyone and the complicated journey toward healing","594":"one of the quotes who reviewed this book said that it isn't quite the ripped from the headlines story but rather what happens after the newspapers stop writing about it and that is so true for this novel i loved getting a glimpse into this family's saga but i felt the book dragged at times writing was great but felt this book was a bit long for what it was trying to accomplish","595":"a solid 3 5 stars the book grabbed me at the beginning and then went flat and drug on for a good portion of the rest of the book","596":"perhaps i came into this with overly high expectations b c it was so strongly recommended there were elements i liked a lot but in spite of the detailed interior examinations of the characters i still felt like this was a rather cold book","597":" remember me like thisbybrett anthony johnstonwhat i knew about this book before i read it a young boy is taken from his family he is gone for four years and then he returns my thoughts after reading this book wow there was no real happy dancing while reading this book it was stark and cold and cruel and sad and has so many layers and levels that it took me days to read it i could not read this book straight through even though it was extremely well written and told an incredible story this family eric and laura parents justin returned son griffin younger son and cecil eric's father everyone found a way to shut down during the four years justin was gone it's so sad laura worked with dolphins eric had an affair griffin learned to skateboard better than his brother even cecil was changed the town is elated when justin is found but then during counseling sure enough come the waves the undercurrents the things that no one is saying why didn't he call he had a girlfriend he was out and about then after being told that the man who took him would not be allowed out of jail he is out and this just makes everything so much worse that is all that i will say this is a book with so much going on and an ending that is mysterious and unbelievable what i loved about this book there was so much to think about with this book but one of my favorite parts was when the sweet little old ladies gave laura a package of lorna doones for justin final thoughts about this book this story sort of reminded me of a story similar to this that happened in st louis a few years ago this family unravelled and then seemed to put themselves back together again or did they how did the body in this book come to be in the river i found this to be a riveting and fascinating book but again very very sad in lots of ways","598":" i received this book as part of the goodreads first reads giveaway program i enjoyed this book until the end the end left the reader with a ton of unanswered questions i felt like the author forgot to include the last few chapters of the book what happened with justin why was it never talked about what happened to justin while he was gone for the 4 years why did we not know what happened to the kidnapper who killed him or did he kill himself what really happened did alice survive there were just a lot of unanswered questions that i really would have liked knowing what really happened a good book but it could use a better ending","599":"i loved this book about a boy who has been missing for four years and then returns to his family told from the point of view of each family member the story focuses on the adjustment each makes without dwelling on the years he was missing","600":"first off thanks to random house publishing and net galley for the early release copy of this book remember me like this by bret anthony johnston is a fabulous story the plot is one that really will hook the reader and keep you engrossed all the way through to the finish so many novels have the fate of having a good opening a saggy middle and then a big finish happily remember me like this does not suffer a stalled out story line at all remember me like this is about a boy justin who is kidnapped at age 11 and then found four years later having been only miles from home the entire time while the story is about a child kidnapping it is more about about all the ripple effects from it rather than the actual event remember me like this is the peek behind the curtain of a family both cemented in the past and longing to move forward before their lost son is found the campbell family is in incapable of moving on without him trying to rebuild a life that does not include justin would be to acknowledge a horrible truth that their beloved might never return when the unbelievable happens and justin is found they feel that their lives suspended for so long can return to normal however finding normal is much more difficult than they imagine","601":"this book was beautifully written the characters were well developed and i could feel the turmoil and loneliness that they went through however it didn't pull me in this was not a page turner for me and not one that i will insist all my friends have to read so just 3 stars","602":"started strong but weak conclusion tired of reading books about children as prey","603":"liked it very much had enjoyed his work in the new yorker excerpt and really liked this despite some minor plot holes recommended and i have to admit i have trouble remembering the title as ironic as that is","604":"an interesting psychological look at the way a family deals with an abduction and what it means to put the pieces back together i was expecting more of a mystery or thriller or something or a plot twist at the end so i was a little disappointed but as long as you start reading he book with the image of what would i do if this happened to my family it will really make you think","605":"the book is very well written and it's also a page turner the ending was a little disappointing it seemed a bit easy and the prologue was unnecessary it also contained a sentence that felt deliberately misleading the characters were well drawn and seeing the story from different points of view was a good choice also i think a good choice not to show justin's point of view there was a well of mystery in that boy one i think he himself was not ready to delve into so it was okay that the readers did not get to know very much about his perspective although i did wish to know more about how things were for him the boy seemed too normal considering the trauma he experienced","606":"i really loved this book about a family whose 11 year old son is abducted and suddenly found and returned home 4 years later the book is not so much about kidnapping as coping with the aftermath really really good","607":" a classic 3 1 2 star book if remember me like this were a kitchen appliance it would be a slow cooker put the chicken in first thing in the morning set it on low and go to work for the day when you get home it'll be done maybe you might want to put in an hour overtime just in case to be upfront and honest i can understand why readers would 5 star this and you curious reader might just fit the profile of a reader who would love it the writing though not stellar is well above ordinary really and the characterization of a texas family the campbells mom dad two sons grandpa is top notch and gorgeous to behold if reading a lot of internal monologues is what you like you'll find johnston's book a memorable one but i'll warn you it's a lot of thinking well done thinking yes but a lot bottom line if you like psychological stories that have little use for a fast moving or real time developing plot click cart or hie thee to the nearest brick and mortar now if it's 10 gallon action you want did i remember to mention the setting is texas you'll suffer some frustration ah the plot it's not that one is lacking it's that the early promise of direct conflict is drawn out for a long time and well never quite fulfilled you might argue well bub that's how an author develops suspense and i agree partially we get a lot of tortured thinking here first of a fractured family with a kidnapped son then of a reunited family stepping on eggshells and finally of an outraged family not sure what to make of the legal system and its guarantees of safety and due process but fans of the crime thriller genre might buy this and find all of the psychological musings mom writes everything important and not so important in a moleskine overdone thus the docked stars i mention this only because taking stock of your preferences as a reader might influence your purchase overall a story of an ordeal no family would ever want to suffer professionally told by a writer who knows how to use everyday actions dialogue description and thoughts to capture characters slowly","608":"a kidnapped boy is found and returned to his family after four years exellect character study of each family member as well as a study of the family itself the author chooses to dwell heavily on the time following the boy's reappearance sparing details of his years as captive","609":"i'd give this a 2 5 i liked it at first but then it got boring because it was bogged down by every character's innermost thoughts and the by the end i really just didn't care that much and it was anticlimactic","610":"update its bugged me for too long this book should be 5 stars 'not' 4 i have recommended it dozens and dozens of times its a great story i was 'hooked' from page one really hooked the only reason i'm not giving this story 5 stars is my patience was starting to be tested about the last 100 pages 364 pages in all i wanted the conclusion faster i just couldn't stand it any longer how is this book going to come together i do think those last 100 pages were not as strong as the rest of the book yet overall this story will stay with the reader a long time its good lovely beautiful writing is a plus also i was able to almost smell the shrimp etc my mind started getting restless towards the very end maybe that's the point though its still restless i'm still thinking about this story this family this community i 'still' want to know more about these characters overall there are many things to like about this novel its very engaging the emotions within this family u0026amp community are so real and raw feels truthful to the core this book would make an excellent 'book club' discussion book just the characters alone let alone the story much could be discussed here's a line i read a few times hm got me thinking the past was a bridge and looked solid and sturdy but once you were on it you saw that it extended only far enough to strand you to suspend you between loss and longing with nowhere to go at all one more mom's can relate to this maybe i should take karate i'd rather you never leave the house i'd rather cover you in bubble wrap i laughed sooooooooooo hard at the above sentence i wouldn't actually 'say' those words to my children but some days to love family love","611":" as much as i enjoyed this book i was slightly bothered by how much of justin's story it left in the realm of mystery particularly the fact that dwight never truly appeared always a shadowy presence spoken of yet never directly encountered on the other hand the examination of all the emotional turmoil undergone by justin's parents and brother in themselves and in relation to one another was beautifully crafted the overall impression was a compelling meditation on the power of communication the challenge of authenticity and trust and the harm done by hiding certain truths for the sake of protecting one's self or others","612":"interesting in depth character development but in the end you know very little about justin perhaps that was the whole point but i grew tired of the endless descriptions of texas heat and wanted something more to happen","613":"this book was well written u0026amp drew me in kept me guessing until the end heavy subject matter but handled in a way that allowed it to be digestible and engrossing","614":"i read this in one day i literally could not put it down excellent depiction of the aftermath of a family trauma","615":"ok first novel but not great too many points of view","616":"read this for fun soon","617":"remember me like this is raw and at times disturbing but how could it not be with a story about a missing child unexpectedly found a few years later johnston is a captivating storyteller creating characters who feel so real creating an unimaginable world of hope after a tragedy and uncertain times i spent every spare moment pulling myself back into the campbell's world unable to pull away from the emotions and suspense of what was going to happen next","618":"nicely written but i got about 80% through it and did not finish the plot although beautifully descriptive just moved so slowly and so much is vague about justin's captivity would have been compelling to have his prospective","619":"i can't say that i really enjoyed this book but i think that the way the author showed all the complicated emotional states and responses of the family members was pretty amazing","620":"they accelerated toward the half known and desperate history that bound them together the true story behind what would otherwise appear to be a simple happy ending this book is a solid read","621":"this is an interesting story about a family whose son disappears and returns years later it is told from all family members' point of view but the one who disappeared so is a most intriguing tale this would make a fun movie i think","622":"heart wrenching there wasn't a page that i wasn't heartbroken for the characters on it","623":" i'm not one that usually writes book reviews but i can't say enough good things about this book if literary fiction is defined by being character driven then this book is literary fiction in its truest form from the very beginning i was drawn into the lives of the characters i could relate to them understand them every character johnston has done a remarkable job of allowing me to travel not just to inhabit one character but many the book elicits emotion from the reader through this connection if you have a heart you should read this book","624":"1 2 way through this book i felt i was on a freight train i had to read faster faster to find out how it would end and it did not disappoint","625":" i thought this was a wonderful idea of a story a kidnapped son returns after four years what issues does he face what issues does his family face how do they all come back together as a family can they resurrect what they once had i honestly found the book repetitive in many places and i thought it could be made much more compelling by dropping the more redundant passages the author has a wonderful way of describing the heat and humidity of coastal texas but after you've read one description you've read them all enough already we understand that it's superbly hot and humid the ending seemed to be building to a dreaded catharsis but it worked itself out with a whimper and not a big bang almost like a hurricane that blows itself out prior to making landfall in short i just didn't enjoy it as much as i felt i should well written and wonderful descriptions but it could easily have been a 200 page book that packed a bigger punch","626":" if books are a way for a reader to understand and experience other lives this is as fine of a study of humanity as it gets johnson creates a portrait of a family rendered asunder by a terrible tragedy a disappearance of their 11 year old son and then brought back together by an incredible unexpected joy of his return four years later through alternating perspectives the readers get to know every flawed complicated character from every angle and the exploration shines in its delicate emotional intelligence it's a fairly small story plot wise not much happens the plot is driven almost exclusively through the powerhouse of a narrative even the locale simmering sizzling summer texas normally a turn off here didn't distract and was easy to overlook with exception of the constant y'alls in fact it became another character in itself another oppressing factor in the lives struggling to obtain and hold on to a semblance of normalcy this is a heavy depressing drama caveat emptor and absolutely stunning read highly recommended","627":"really liked this book","628":"couldn't put this down gripping story albeit not the most amazing writing ever","629":"great read every family's worst nightmare satisfying ending","630":"i really enjoyed this book i would have read it in one sitting had i been able to i enjoyed the guessing game of what happened to dwight i had to dock a star because i thought griff's relationship was to far fetched for a 14 year old boy that part really bugged me","631":"not the most elegant writing but i was totally caught up in the story of a boy's disappearance and the profound effect it had on each person in his family","632":" this is a quiet and compelling novel reminiscent of those written by kent haurf the story chronicles a family's experiences and the aftermath when their young son justin is kidnapped and held for four years before finally being spotted and returned to his parents once again bret anthony johnston's writing style like kent haurf is eloquent spare and beautiful the author shows amazing insight as he explores the family's grief their guilt and their isolation when confronted with this tragic event the novel it told in the alternating perspectives of four of the family members as they attempt to reconcile reintegrate and heal from what must be the worst nightmare that any parent will suffer the family members have all been transformed by the kidnapping and wrestle with how to move forward once justin has returned the writing is remarkable and emotionally powerful i highly recommend this wonderful book and author","633":" this was a very moving and rare look into one families life after their kidnapped son is found and returned home justin has been missing for four years and is now 17 years old the story is more a characterization of each family member justin's mom dad younger brother griff and grandpa cecil it was both haunting and realistic not much is mentioned about what happened during justin's four year ordeal nor why he did not try to escape instead it explores how each person including justin attempts to pick up life where they left off four years earlier i wished i had the time to read this book in one sitting it was that good it also explores the issue of guilt that each person feels excellent writing storyline with a very satisfying conclusion can't wait to read more from this author i received a complimentary copy as part of the librarything earlyreviewers","634":"so tedious i almost couldn't finish it it's only saving grace was that it was set near my hometown","635":" remember me like this is thought provoking you will sit and think long after you have finished reading this book particularly if you are a parent this book is not dissimilar to room but the perspective is more from the family of the missing then returned child the impact of the loss of a child is profound whilst the child is deemed missing the torment is endless when found deceased the child's family is sentenced to a lifetime of grief but to have that child suddenly found returned therein lies the difference in this book the author takes you on a very difficult and painful journey as a family try to rebuild to reconnect and to understand their changed relationship with their son this book is sad and poignant and well written it's not a feel good story but it is well and truly worthy of reading i was provided with a free copy of this book to review and give my honest opinion","636":"this was a pretty good book i was expecting more from it though very intriguing premise about a kidnapping victim who is found after four years and returned to his family i enjoyed seeing all the characters' perspectives about this return and the effects on the family but then the ending was just wrapped up so nice and neat it left me a little cold i wouldn't necessarily recommend it","637":"it kept me on edge wanting to know what happened and at the same time not wanting to know i couldn't decide if it was a 3 or 4 star book i finally decided 4 stars because i kept wanting to get back to it each time i had to put it down","638":" in a small town near corpus christi tx a young boy is kidnapped four years later he is found alive and rescued while one would expect a horror story of the kidnapping and abuse this book is about the way the event even the rescue changes the boy's family his mother father grandfather and younger brother and how they are continually trying to adapt while the book is well written it is so agonizing and depressing one really feels for each of the survivors i think the reader experiences the feeling one can have about not wanting to be around the grieving what can you do or say etc","639":"wow great book","640":"the author provides an insightful look at how a family copes with the return of a child who has been missing for four years the focus of this book is not on what happened to the missing child but on the family it explores the complexity of the family members' emotional responses how they have been affected by grief guilt isolation and how they begin to heal i really liked the ending","641":"kept me reading and interested in the middle i started glossing over paragraphs i thought the author was a little repetitive and the story stagnated the ending could have been so much better good story good characters overall kept me entertained","642":"justin is an eleven year old who is kidnapped near corpus christi tx four years later he is reunited with his family his parents younger brother u0026amp grandfather the book follows the aftermath of the victim u0026amp his family as they struggle with becoming a family once again","643":"heart wrenching to read as a mom but well written and didn't want to put it down","644":"i could not put this down really the plot was so seamless and natural and constantly surprising especially considering the subject matter definitely one of my best reads in a long time","645":"bottom line i would not recommend this book the time was depressing and hum drum nothing really happened and the author gave details on inane events which i found myself skimming through despite that it held my interest enough to finish it which is the only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 from me","646":"this fast paced and emotionally wrought journey of a family whose kidnapped son returns is definitely worth reading i liked everything except the ending which was an overly reflective epilogue that posed too many maybe questions that took away from what could have been decent closure it's not the type of book that can be wrapped up neatly and i'm glad it didn't but this felt a bit tacked on and forced","647":" i won this book in a goodreads first reads contest i was pleasantly surprised by this book i had started out reading it thinking that it would be the usual family drama after a member does story but then that missing son shows up alive the story is about what happens after justin shows up after being held captive for many years how the family copes with all that has happened and how they cope with his kidnapper being arrested and all that transpires after that the book shifts points of view everyone's but justin's this drags the reader into really becoming invested in all that is going on while not hashing out what happened to justin while he was held captive it focuses on the family and the issues that come up with them after justin is found i liked this book and am glad i read it","648":"i thought the end of this book was incredibly weak and very disappointing","649":" sometimes a reader and a book come together with subtle magnetism each invisibly drawn towards the other that's how i felt shortly after i picked up this book after i received a free courtesy copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review the author sets the venue as southport texas which i'm certain is actually portland across the bridge from corpus christi the landscapes smells weather structures atmosphere and people are portrayed with flawless accuracy what we have is a family who is torn apart by the stress of the mysterious disappearance of one of the two sons followed by his return four years later in deus ex machina fashion the boy had been kidnapped and likely sexually molested and we soon begin to understand full well that there is an abundance of victims of psychological collateral damage just like in real life there is no preparation for random traumatic events nor are there any obvious remedies to let the afflicted reconstruct their world this book isn't a clinical study nor are we talking about actual people but i found myself professionally convinced of the accuracy of the author's insights furthermore i soon had images of real people in my mind then certain events stir the pot again such as the pendency of a criminal trial and the issue of whether self help might produce closure that won't do irreparable damage no tells here but i can say that anyone who's ever found themselves caught up in events beyond their control can likely relate to what it's like when the characters are forced to look into the abyss man's search for redemption is perhaps best successfully concluded when struggles against adversity are won when the odds looked anything but rosy","650":"i received this book from goodreads remember me like this is a novel about a family turned upside down when their son is abducted it showcases the viewpoint from every member of the family except the victim i found myself tormented by my own thoughts of what could have happened to this child a novel i won't soon forget","651":"firstly i want too say a huge thank you for this book that i was sent though goodreads first reads and then a huge sorry for the amount of time it took me to read it and boy do i regret it now i really enjoyed this book and it was great to read it with a totally different perspective too what you usually get in this style of book i thought it was well written and so real it was great thank you so much again for sending it too me","652":" bret anthony johnston is incredibly skilled at characterization i felt as though i truly knew this family and i cared deeply for each one despite their flaws if not for life getting in the way i would have finished this story in one sitting even then it would have taken me longer to read than it should have as i returned to previous pages to reread and savor certain passages what does this story of loss and redemption have it is filled with humanity and poignancy what does it not have that many novels do a formula i loved this book","653":"won this from goodreads well written story about the psychological effect of child abduction on the family highly recommended","654":"i have to remember that i'm really not the psychological side of things i was hoping for a trial or for some sort of understanding of why justin was abducted but that wasn't what this book was about not a terrible read if you go into it knowing it's more about the effects on the family of abducted children but that is not what i thought it was only going to be about just an okay read for me","655":"although it was a sad topic i thought the author really did a great job capturing the emotions the the whole family felt i would give this a 3 5","656":"this book was beautifully written and the story kept you turning the pages i liked all of the characters my lower rating is because it was a book that filled me with sadness so sad that i didn't want to recommend it to friends as a book they should read if you don't mind sad then you may want to read this one","657":"d held promise at the beginning good writer but just didn't have the motivation to read beyond 100 pages i may try something else he writes","658":" justin campbell had been kidnapped four years ago and now he's returned to his family \"remember me like this\" tells the story of his reintegration and of his family's response first exuberant and then each person struggling in their own way to make sense of the trauma justin brother griff their father their mother and their grandfather are all likeable tragic characters their responses are believable and each turns to an outsider to assist in the process part thriller part family drama part character study the story told by johnston's capable pen avoids sensationalizing justin's heart breaking abuse and his family's guilt and need for retribution sometimes i felt like i was reading jodi picoult but here the sadness was more mitigated the resolution less contrived \"remember me\" will be the sort of book that hangs in the recesses of my mind both the shattering situation and the family's remarkable resilience","659":"i really wanted to like this book but it was just not enjoyable in any way it was an interesting and heart wrenching story to tell how a family deals in the aftermath of their kidnapped son being found after four years but it became a very heavy character study bogged down in too many details and limited plot","660":"it took me quite a long time to get through this book i found it to be slow and pretty predictable","661":"this is an interesting topic for a fiction novel but this book was so slow and redundant the author seemed like he was trying so hard to describe in too many words what each person affected was going through minute by agonizing minute i felt like i was watching a two hour dateline story that could have been told in one hour i'm not sure why i finished this book as it was so painfully slow maybe someone who has gone through trauma could relate more to this story","662":"remember me like this is one of those books that tear at your heart while you hold your heart full of feelings there are so many redemptive qualities in the book that the harshness of the subject matter is masked a child returns after being kidnapped four years ago the family kept looking and finally one day a stranger thought she recognized justin and like that he was saved he returns a teenager with locked chapters in his head justin returns to a family that has been slowly imploding with his absence this alone would make a wonderful book but bret anthony johnston chose the time after his being found to write about it is a time to rebuild the family while keeping everyone safe and healing except for one small detail - the alleged perpetrator the book will be with me for a while while this book is not a traditional thriller you are on the edge more than once worrying about the characters willing them to heal wanting to celebrate with them different family members write different chapters as the various points of views exposed this gave the story a more rounded aspect and included more of the angst this book is a giant wow i absolutely will be sharing about this book with many people encouraging them to read remember me like this bret anthony johnston has written a must read book of the summer perhaps the most poignant part for me is there is a missing girl from conway who has been missing for sometime and the family continues to look for her with the same urgency","663":"he has some skills it was plot driven and there was some complex writing about some of the relationships and it certainly held my attention but not really a book i will remember or recommend i did enjoy it as a break between book club books though","664":"this book was a real and searching look at what trauma can do to a family i enjoyed hearing the story from the perspectives of all family members however the more i think about the end the more i think it was a cop out i don't want to ruin it but there was such anguish and unknowing throughout the whole book and then it tied up a little too neatly for my taste overall though i think it's an interesting read and i would definitely recommend it","665":"i received an advanced digital copy of this from netgalley at age 11 justin mysteriously disappears from a small town in texas leaving his parents and younger brother to cope with the loss an even worse living each day not knowing if he is still alive after four years justin is reunited with his family after being found in a neighboring town upon justin's return the reader follows the family as they try to return to normal a state which can be nothing more than a delicate balance of who they were before justin's disappearance and who they became in the four years after overall i thought it was interesting story and i feel like the author did a great job showing diversity in the character's reactions and behaviors not only amongst each other but also from characters in other literature and film portrayals however there were several points where the story seemed to drag on and spend too much time on scenes that did not move the plot forward additionally coming from a background in criminal justice i take issue with some of the inconsistencies in plans for the legal case surrounding justin's disappearance","666":"this book was very touching but very difficult to read it was so close to reality that it was heartbreaking to have it splayed out on the page for all to read how life isn't full of happy endings even when your wishes come true","667":"such a good book the descriptive language is delicious i read this book slow so i could savor every adjective yum","668":"read this book beautiful and heartbreaking i was crying within 5 minutes of starting it many times throughout and the whole last chapter just lovely","669":" when i first got started into this book an unbelievable amount of grief for this family enveloped me i have two daughters and as a parent i found this book an emotional read i am one of those worst case scenario parents a little suffocating but i try to hold it in and let them learn to navigate the world on their own but with supervision so i think about what would happen if someone took one or both of my girls and i can't even describe it because my mind won't let me go there it is protecting itself from the unthinkable somehow though johnston was able to describe some of it to us in the beginning of the book placing us in that unbearable unthinkable place when justin is found i rejoiced but to read all the horrors he endured to watch him go through so much emotionally i saw red i was so pissed i was thinking about all the horrible things i would have done to his abductor this book covers an emotional roller coaster of our capacity to heal this book focuses not on the crime as it is occurring but it delves into what happens after even though it was hard to read at times because of the content this family and the way that they start to get through this is nothing short of a miracle and i am so glad that i got to read their story","670":"sorry i wasn't enjoying it and just stopped at page 236 i kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did","671":"as promised this book doesn't focus on what happen when her son is kidnapped but rather on the journey to healing her family the best way they can bittersweet because no one wins in this situation story of hope and healing","672":"what a sneaky little book picked this up randomly after reading a review somewhere ew i think but didn't have very high expectations since it seemed like so few people had read it i loved it easily one of the best books i've read this year beautifully written and the characters were fantastically drawn i feel sad to have finished it","673":"i thought this was a pretty good book just too gloomy for me to give it more than three stars","674":"well written but dragged on and i stopped caring","675":"i liked this book for many different reasons the author's skillful yet subtle descriptions drew me into his world so effortlessly that i felt like i'd traveled through the small texas town where the campbell family lived he didn't have to resort to making the point of view characters quirky or demented to keep me interested they were ordinary loving family members whose lives were torn apart when one of them disappeared that fast their lives changed forever i needed to know what happened to justin before he was found after he was found and i needed to know how the family would cope after i closed the book needing to know was what made me turn the pages to the very end bret anthony johnston's talent for writing multidimensional characters who struggled with real emotions will make me remember this story for years to come","676":"3 49 starsthis was like eating a giant tootsie pop and discovering the chewy chocolate center is missing lick lick lick lick lick suck suck suck lick lick lick suck suck suck suck this hard candy stuff is yummy but where's my reward for all that sucking and licking at the end there's just that white paper stick soggy with your saliva bret anthony johnson is a talented writer and i would read another novel from him for sure but he gave us all the good stuff in the first half of the story in the second half he belabored all the points he'd already made and ultimately didn't hand over what he made us crave early on lick suck lick suck ick uck wet stick now if you'll excuse me i need to go brush my teeth","677":"very strong and real characters and yet another oft told story told differently","678":" it has been four years since justin the campbell's 11 year old son was abducted near corpus christi his family has been torn apart by the experience not knowing what has happened to him then one day he is found and returns home but this is just the beginning of the story with the pacing and tension of a thriller this novel gets inside the heads of justin's parents and younger brother as they have to make another huge adjustment welcoming him back into their family and dealing with the release on bail of his abductor this may be 5 under 35 johnston's debut novel but he writes with the skill and grace of a master craftsman it grabbed me from the first pages recommended","679":" i received a free copy of this book through the goodreads first reads giveaways remember me like this by bret anthony johnston is every parents' nightmare how does one go on living when your child is taken and nowhere to be found how do you react when that child is found years later and you are given another chance can life return to normalcy i really enjoyed this book as it represented the views of the various family members of the campbell household i also liked that justin's story is fuzzy as in you never fully know what this child went through during his ordeal the reader receives glimpses of justin's time away and then there are hints that allows the reader to decide what may or may not have happened of course one hopes for the best this was a good read that i had a hard time putting down and kept my interest up until the last page","680":" justin campbell has been missing for four years and his family along with the entire community has never stopped looking for him and then one day he reappears much to the joy and astonishment of all and life goes on right wrong bret anthony johnston weaves a taut intricate deeply suspenseful tale as he tells the story of what happens to a loving family when tragedy befalls them the characters are expertly rendered and as we get inside the heads of eric and laura justin's parents griff his brother and cecil his grandfather we feel as though we are actually living their lives so detailed are the emotions and thoughts drawn we learn of the agony they felt during the long years looking for justin and the initial joy and subsequent fear they experience once he is found will justin ever recover from his ordeal will the family do you ever get over something like this consider this exchange between laura and a friend i've been wondering how much any of us can take the worst is behind y'all he said you'd think so wouldn't you really once the worst happens it's always happening it's never not happening and when they learn the kidnapper has been released on bail prior to trial the family's paranoia kicks into overdrive although it has the characteristics of a thriller this is not an action packed fast paced story in fact at times the slow pace is frustrating we don't get any gory details about justin's captivity we don't learn any grisly facts about the kidnapper's life but after a while we're glad we're not being offered a police procedural and we settle down to what is an amazing character driven novel we just get the thoughts and deeply loving actions of the campbell family as they fight to find their child and once found to protect him as well as themselves it's interesting that the only person we don't really hear from is justin himself what is he thinking just what happened to him during those four years just where is he going all those nights when he sneaks out of the house justin is at the center of this story but he is not the main character you could say it is the entire family who takes the starring role this is a debut novel for johnston we are in for a real treat with this author","681":"this book has it all intrigue love sadness parental guilt teenage angst violence and suspense this is in my opinion a must read i loved it","682":" this is probably the heaviest novel i have read for a long time it is a deep analysis into what the kidnap of a child does to every member of a family and when that child is found and home again how nothing can be the same how they struggle to cope with how to be normal how to continue there is no fast action no end goal in sight for the family because nothing can ever be the same again how does this change someone change a family what small intimacies between parents and children become uncertainties of acceptance and truth the brutal reality of how families fall apart in a sea of sudden uncertainty of parenthood how each person deals with the trauma in their own way how it impacts on their relationships both inside and outside of the family and then again when justin is home again after 5 years how they have no idea how to begin again and have to learn how to be a family all over again but with the knowledge of what has happened to justin i struggled reading this book because it is so heavy i could feel it dragging me down with it however that is the mark of how a good writer can make you feel a story and not just read it what makes it different it is written so beautifully and insightful it is not a story of the kidnap and search but of what how it impacts on personal lives day after day when doors close it offers a reminder of how families live with the trauma of a missing child after that child is brought home this is an account of the trauma starting over again in a way that is heartbreaking there is a tenderness that will touch every parent who reads it what did i like best i love the descriptions that convey the pain of coping in their world which feels so real you are afraid it has to be true eric justin's father describes his pain \"how often in the last four years had he almost knocked justin's bedroom door then when his thoughts fitted themselves to reality he felt cored out and drugged groping awkwardly through his days as if he'd lost a limb in an accident an arm or leg whose weight he still anticipated he recognised its absence and yet he could still feel the arteries as they dilated the nerves as they burned johnston describes how each member of the family cope in their own way beautifully so that you have a real sense of how they move through their days in their own way laura throws herself into an anonymity of volunteering at a dolphin research place griff his brother disappears into his own anonymity of being the brother left behind and eric his father has an affair but each feels responsible for justin's disappearance what was not so good for me because of the 'heaviness' of the writing i almost lost the will to live and nearly gave up reading it has a feeling of being one long pain driven account of despair when a child is kidnapped which is most likely true but to read it in a novel can be very depressing butit is stunningly accurate in its emotional account of how a family falls apart coping when a child is kidnapped and found five years later i had to keep reading to find what the conclusion was ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~many thanks to the publisher via netgalley for a copy for my honest review","683":"four years ago justin campbell was kidnapped this novel is the story of what happens after his return to his family in keeping the focus on the campbell family johnston does make some sacrifices that make the book less exciting than it perhaps could have been but his prose is so stark and haunting that it works debut novels are rarely this good","684":"loved the way bret anthony johnston developed these characters i felt their anguish i wanted to join their search i would have staked out the house for them this left such an impact on me","685":"as a parent you cannot begin to imagine the abduction of your child what happens when that child is returned what does it do to the family dynamic how is each member of the family personally affected and how does the abducted returned child feel this book picks up four years after the abduction of justin campbell and his subsequent return this book seemed like a realistic depiction of this family its members and the repercussions of the abduction of a child i felt my stomach tighten at times felt a surge of maternal love at other times and throughout did not note many false emotions a talented writer to be sure for capturing the emotion of each family member and even the surrounding small texas town","686":"great story great storytelling you can feel the characters anguish","687":" richly descriptivei borrowed this based on the nyt book review and i got the deeply moving prose i sought it was unfortunately a bit to verbose at times and i found myself skipping paragraphs hoping to get past it it may be that the story was just too long and i wanted to know the answer to the opening scene kept expecting a different kind of book it's a story about love and loss and fear and hope nothing more it's how lives are changed by tragedy it's not a court case or cop thriller as i had expected but i still liked it","688":"i liked this book i really did but i only gave it 3 stars cuz for me it felt like the tone was out of whack so much foreboding no dramatic climax it was eerie and left me feeling disquieted powerful but the ultimate feeling it inspired was not awe","689":"very good story it was a sad story but had a happy ending happy things worked out for the family","690":"remember me like this by bret anthony johnston is a highly recommended novel about a family in crisis justin campbell disappeared 4 years ago at age 11 in southern texas since that time the campbell family parents eric and laura grandfather cecil and younger brother griffin has been coasting and slowly disintegrating under their stress and grief they have become alienated from each other and themselves eric has been lying about his actions and having an affair laura has been working at a dry cleaners and putting in many hours volunteering at a local aquarium and tending a sick dolphin griffin is now 14 with his first girlfriend everyone knew what they had endured and what they had lost more and more eric had the sorry sense that he and laura were both just treading water trying to stay afloat until griff graduated high school a good husband a good father he only knew he'd filled those roles at one time though he could hardly recall it now location 250 cecil is more taciturn about his emotions this was another thing he'd learned over the years sometimes a man's obligation was to tell his family what he knew of life but more often his duty was to keep it to himself location 479 then miraculously justin is found in nearby corpus christi the family must rally together to help him recover but this requires that they confront their own issues by all outward appearances justin seems fine and doesn't talk about his four year ordeal but he is clearly suffering from stockholm syndrome clearly the family's development is arrested too meanwhile his abductor dwight harrell is charged and released on bond which sends the individuals in the family into a tail spin this is a capable and well crafted debut novel by johnston he explores the themes of family bonds and guilt in a family that must either rebuild their lives and connections or find a new way to live in their fractured current state of existence he allows much of the inner turmoil of some of the family members to boil and bubble over as they contemplate their next moves while i enjoyed remember me like this quite a bit i had a few problems with it opening with eric's affair was an immediate turn off for me i comprehend the implications of his actions but it didn't need to be thrust to the forefront of the beginning of the novel then after justin comes home it seemed like there was just endless inner dialogue going on i guess i was expecting more outward sharing and more exposure of the events that happened and how justin could be healed along with the family if you like slow moving family dramas with lots of emotional inner contemplation monologues from family members then this is a good choice for you it's well written which should help your enjoyment enormously disclosure my kindle edition was courtesy of random house for review purposes","691":"good but not great wanted so much more out of the story good author and enjoyed reading about the galveston area but there was just too much left out of the story for it to be a great read","692":"very interesting type of story line really enjoyed the book thanks to goodreads for another chance to enjoy a new book","693":"i kept waiting for a bomb to drop but it just never went anywhere","694":"remember me like this by bret anthony johnston is about a young teen boy named justin who has been missing for four years one day he is found in a town not too far away but that is just the beginning justin returns home and finds that his dad mom and younger brother are not the same and he is not either great play between the family members makes this book rock and they all have their own secrets that they are not telling i got into this one quickly with the great writing i really enjoyed it and now this is my new book of the month so far for may gerard's review","695":"a really fine novel written from the differing points of view of a family suddenly reunited with a son who disappeared four years prior kidnapped it turns out as one might expect it is emotionally wrenching but ultimately hopeful focusing on the collective bonds that hold a family together and help it to heal","696":"not my typical read not even sure if it was an ad or a greader or an article that drew my attention to the author but it's a decent read maybe 3 75 the plot is not only headline material but also suspenseful and rings false in a couple of major facets can't specify without spoiling but the writing is good and inner lives of most of the characters feel true enough and accurately detailed enough except for the victim to appreciate i guess the descriptions of the loss and isolation of the family are the best parts the loneliness and guilt and futility felt by the family i quite like the cover design","697":"eric laura and the son griff are drifting through life trying to exist since the disappearance of their son brother justin 2 years ago then the unbelievable happens the police call and justin has been found a tip from a vendor that saw his missing poster all seems well on the surface justin has been saved from his abductor and the family is overjoyed to have him home but sometimes justice is unkind and the kidnapper is granted bail to be with his dying mother how the family copes is a story that you can't put down and i absolutely love the ending so well written and complex the characters could live next door a great read","698":"didn't love it didn't live up to the suspense promised too predictable","699":" it's been four years since 11 year old justin disappeared without a trace his family has tried to hold it together in his absence but are often barely hanging on with his parents and younger brother all secretly blaming themselves now suddenly the news comes that justin has been found and the family has to learn to right itself once again in trying to embrace his return and deal with the changes the pain of the previous four years have inflicted on them i really loved this book johnston creates such a sense of place in his writing the town and it's people felt palpable and very real to me i appreciated that he didn't dwell on exactly what happened to justin during his absence he provides enough detail to answer the big questions but what happened to justin in his time away is not the focus of the book the coverage of those four years is mainly to show what brought his family to the state they're in upon his return the real crux of the book is how they deal with where they are now and try to move on it's a lovely story and i would highly recommend it","700":"i know this book is a big deal but it has so many unanswered questions there was way too much detail about unnecessary things and a complete lack of detail in others i guess i missed the greatness","701":"a story about a boy who was kidnapped and returned four years later there is a lot here to engage with including the texas setting the family members and the crime itself it is a good solid read but of course upsetting it's a situation that feels almost impossible to imagine but the author did it for us nicely","702":"well written but i just couldn't get into the story","703":"eric and laura campbell's son justin was kidnapped and went missing for four years the book opens while justin is still missing and we see what his family members were doing to cope after he was found and returned home and the initial elation wore off the family tried to return to normal of course things could never be exactly as they had been then they find out the kidnapper is going to be out on parole and the family goes into a free fall this author has an absolutely beautiful writing style his descriptions are poetic i loved this thought provoking book","704":" i felt very tense the whole time i was reading this book i constantly felt like there was another shoe about to drop which is how the main family in the story probably felt most of the time i liked how the author didn't feel the need to go into graphic detail about justin's kidnapping instead the focus was more on the happiness and struggle of justin being back home and re acclimating to his family you know that on the periphery the sordid details are out there in the media in people's conversations etc but the family doesn't discuss them instead they focus on each other this approach made me feel like i was more a part of the family than an outside party to the story it gave me a better understanding of the family's motivations and the actions they had to take in order to move on with their son","705":"well written but also frustrating book its about a boy who was kidnapped and then found 4 years later its from the perspective of everyone in his family and goes into great detail about how they feel and what the do to cope with both his disappearance and his return but you never hear from justin the boy himself what happened to him is revealed only in pieces and you never really learn much about the 4 years he was captive strange device and sort of a tease i also felt like the end of the book the final boat trip u0026amp the shrimporee were awkward story telling and not believable","706":"this was more psychological suspense than mystery because it focuses on the time after a missing child is found and returned to his family the story is told through the eyes of four family members the parents grandfather and brother of the missing boy first following how each copes with the four years the boy is missing and then with the older boy returned to them and the man arrested for his imprisonment the family struggles with the changes in all of their lives with guilt and relief and puzzlement of their own actions as well as those around them it was very fascinating and involving with well realized characters growing in ways they never imagined and finding damage they never expected the book it most reminded me of was ordinary people if you want to know what makes people tick this one is for you highly recommended","707":"there are those who write from the heart and those who don't","708":" really once the worst happens it's always happening it's never not happening \"remember me like this\" by bret anthony johnson took my breath away the \"ripped from the headlines\" plot touches the reader emotionally on so many levels suspense happiness sadness fear and the writing is absolutely beautiful johnson is one of those writers who is so talented it reminds me why i should stick to reading set in the greater corpus christi texas area with which i'm familiar johnson's prose beautifully captures the tone and the heat of that environment with its small town sensibilities while still being a busy tourist area the novel begins 4 years after justin campbell was abducted at age 11 and takes us through the rollercoaster ride that he and his family embark upon as he returns to them it's fascinating who hasn't wondered what happens when a kidnap victim is returned to their \"old life\" we try not to be voyeuristic when we read the papers and watch the newscasts but it's human to wonder and speculate johnson has taken into account that very human curiosity and created a humane touching and sensitive story bret anthony johnson is a writer to watch i know i'll be anxiously awaiting his next novel","709":"this was a hard book for me as a parent but it was well done it did drag in the middle and there were points where i wanted it to go on already but still good","710":"this was good but it simply could have been better the premise is brilliant and i'm fairly certain not done before or at the very least not done well the characters are interesting excepting the women who felt like women written by a man and the teens especially were real and not just figments of the author so yes read it but after the first 190 pages you might want to stop and i wouldn't tell you not to","711":"reminiscent of an oprah book family tragedy family slowly unravels while trying to hold it together it reads like a thriller and i was certainly engrossed but after finishing it became entirely forgettable","712":" wow incredible book so there have been quite a few books out lately that deal with child sexual abuse but this book is different in that it does not delve into the details of the abuse instead it delves into what the effects are of having a kidnapped and abused child return to his family the books basically opens with justin nearly 16 now being returned to his family and while describing eric's dad laura's mom and griffin's other son reactions to justin's return the narrative expertly and engagely weaves in past detalis of their trauma along with their current thoughts and fears each character's experiences are fully realized and so well crafted that i felt like i was in the house with them as they ate in the car with them as eric teaches his lost son how to drive with griffin as he tries to navigate his first relationship amid thoughts of his brother's past four years with laura as she tries to come to grips with now know what happened to her son but also trying to move on a create a new life truly a fantastic book and i look forward to johnson's next novel","713":" sixteen year old justin campbell is spotted by a flea market worker four years after his disappearance from his home in corpus christi texas the kidnapper is arrested and justin is returned to his family parents eric and laura younger brother griff and grandfather cecil the novel is told in these four alternating perspectives as the family attempts to reintegrate justin into their lives both needing and afraid to understand what he went through some reviewers say they'd have been more satisfied if justin's point of view had been included in the novel some say they were frustrated that justin's ordeal at the hands of what is hinted to be a violent rapist was never revealed to the reader both of these things i accept as the author's decisions this book could have been stellar without more information about justin because nothing about justin himself is the point of this story the rest of the family is the point what happens when you lose a child and then get him back how do you accept that he's standing in your kitchen eating cereal when for years you hoped he was dead given the alternatives in your imagination how do you become a family of four again after you were forced to become a family of three they're all psychologically fascinating emotionally powerful questions and the answers of the novel start out intriguingly messy then spiral into bleakness and powerlessness seemingly for their own sake still were it well written i could have appreciated the novel for what it is life can feel bleak humans often feel and or are powerless if that's where the author wants to take me i'll follow to a point the prose here is pleasant enough though all the character voices sound the same including the teenager's the dialogue is neither memorable nor cringe worthy the metaphors are heavy handed justin's snake laura's dolphin but they work but the plot the plot there are a few high points such as the campbell family's getting the news that justin's abductor has made bail and is staying in his parents' home easy driving distance from their house apparently sans ankle monitor because that's plausible for the most part however very little happens even the climax is mostly a non event for the point of view characters still the book might have coaxed three stars out of me simply because it's a psychological exploration and i find those fascinating in almost any form not literally any it turns out here are the twin fatal flaws of remember me like this narrative summary and inner monologue the majority of this book's scenes are summarized told to the reader as one of the characters is thinking about what happened an hour ago yesterday last week last year almost nothing happens in real time instead we get endless introspection from all four of these characters they just think and remember and think and remember some more it's frustrating it deadens the suspense entirely and it kept me at arm's length from these people for the entire book these two story killing flaws will keep me from reading johnston again i wanted to care about these characters but being mired in their every thought leaves me with nothing to infer or discover for myself and ultimately with nothing to feel for any of them","714":"a unique perspective on the effects of a family when their son brother is kidnapped and returned four years later","715":"the first half of this book was a gripping look at a family torn apart by grief and the miracle that brought them back together the second half was slow and seemed to drag on and didn't have the same suspenseful feel to it","716":"excellent book the writing was very good","717":"strangely unsatisfying i enjoyed the first two thirds and this was definitely on track for a four star however for reasons that i can't quite identify i found that the resolution was dispiriting perhaps this is because the denouement was more a reflection of reality rather than meeting my ingrained indoctrinated desire for a happy ever after","718":"really enjoyed this book a quick read a sad story about a child abduction and his ultimate return time is spent with different characters as they work through their feelings of loss guilt anger depression well written and worthwhile","719":"cool topic","720":"the return of an abducted kid is a curious event and that is the plot of our story here 11 year old justin is last seen leaving with his skateboard in the fictional texas town of southport he is spotted at a flea market 4 years later in corpus christi an hour away rescued and subsequently returned to his beleaguered family a heavy event on any scale the family eric laura cecil pawpa and younger brother griff don't even know what to do with themselves upon justin's return missing for fours years had just started to rip the family dynamic apart each person falling apart a little each year in their own unique ways the return of justin is at once joyous and also as we start to learn a loaded gun at first it's almost like his return acts as a drug on all the members of the family his mere presence in the house is like they all popped some ecstasy the happiness extends into every element of their lives buoys them but slowly a nagging feeling that it can't last starts to run through your head how exactly are you supposed to treat the return of an abducted child there's going to be a lot going on with him we intuit horrible things have happened to justin during his time away with buford perfect name for an unseemly abductor but we never get the full story it's both creepy and tantalizing as when he returns we want to know as much as every character in the book there are tidbits thrown out here and there enough that you get the gist it's like his family wants to know but to hear it spoken might prove to be catastrophic how delicate the emotional fabric of the family is is part of the allure of the book it starts in one uncomfortable space only to unsuspectingly slide into a different type of weird space all together the characters are very well written and the heat of south texas bears down and frayed my nerves like i was there right along side the drama","721":"when a horrible crime happens to one the impact lives on not only in the victim but to those closest to them \"remember me like this\" speaks of lives forever changed and family trying to live on with all the conflicting emotions and stress of life 'after ' this story is told the points of view of the parents sibling and grandparent an achingly haunting tale that is well worth the read thanks to goodreads first reads for my copy","722":" this novel opens with the discovery of a body is it that of justin campbell who disappeared 4 years ago at 11 years old no because a flea market vendor recognizes justin from numerous flyers papering the town he returns home to his parents eric and laura and younger brother griff and his abductor is arrested the family handles justin with kid gloves never delving into his life as a captive as they begin to dig out of their grief stricken lives they are all more than a little apprehensive certainly about what unspeakable torture justin may have suffered but experience even more anxiety about whether he might want to return to that life justin's therapist has warned the family members about stockholm syndrome and that prying may do more harm than good griff however as justin's only real sounding board besides his therapist gleans a little more info than his parents do also griff has harbored a secret burden of guilt since justin's disappearance because an argument kept him from accompanying justin on that fateful day 4 years ago the giddy euphoria of justin's return is short lived for the family as developments in the criminal case bring on a new cloud of foreboding and the sense that things may be too good to be true i really liked this book and i would have loved it if some activities near the end hadn't seemed a little out of character and not quite up to the level of the first  3\/4  of the novel i also would have appreciated a little more insight into the actions of dwight buford the abductor but perhaps the author didn't feel he could really get into the head of such a character or perhaps the author didn't want to sully this story of family mending with too much unspeakable evil overall the novel was gripping without being overly sentimental","723":"suspenseful storyline well developed believable characters the despair and emptiness of the family of a missing child is described so well you can feel their pain and suffering","724":"alot of loose ends but i liked reading it","725":"this is a ruminative and sometimes insightful story of an abducted and ultimately returned teen and the resulting hurt it is told from the perspectives of multiple characters and for all of them touches desperation deep wounds and also resilience the blurb says it is fast paced but i didn't think so likely due in part to the rather lugubrious reader on the audio version","726":"for four long year's the campbell family has suffered mother and father eric and laura and there son griff have spent that whole time in despair at the disappearance of there son and older brother justin having had there hopes raised time after time again the campbell's are suspicious when a boy matching justin's description is found alive and well only for it indeed to be the miracle they were hoping for the sands of time have caused deep psychological scars on the family eric having found solace in an affair while laura has volunteered her time looking after sick dolphins in a bid to hide her unhappiness and griff has found himself a girlfriend to share his frustrations with justin back the families tries to go forward only for things to go backward when it is revealed that the alleged kidnapper of justin dwight buford has been released as is planning to plead not guilty at his trial the family have only two real options one to move to another state or two go to the extreme to eliminate the problem the mere thought of knowing buford is alive and nearby is to much for the family that now thinks the risk of blowing itself apart is a much better option than the thought of him walking free remember me like this was a hard book for me take in on the positive side this tragic tale of an american family has many themes that will make you think such as how we as humans deal with grief and does it every really end this could happen to any one of us and it begs the question how would you react to the disappearance of a loved one on the other side though the authors writing style for me over describes scenes to such a degree that i would end up scipping the odd paragraph while the ending seemed out of place with it's upbeat feeling although the open ending did add to the novel's feel for being thought provoking","727":"i couldn't finish this book it was so slow moving and just lacking a layered look into the emotions of the different family members","728":" well written detailed portrait of a family devastated by a child's disappearance and shakily restored by his reappearance four years later what bothered me was that the story of what happened to the boy is left behind a veil his parents and his psychologist are afraid to ask the only one who gets glimpses is the younger brother that might have worked if justin was somehow more visibly damaged yet he appears to be very self possessed other than his odd sleeping pattern it is never explained why he didn't try to return to his family living within a short walkable distance while kidnapped he had friends and a girl friend and was curiously uninterested in his family there are hints about the stockholm syndrome and death threats but basically justin is a black box the rest of the family totally believable and heart wrenchingly rendered","729":"glad i read it but ultimately disappointed there's so much we never get to find out that it falls flat after an intriguing first half","730":" a few years back there was a book called the deep end of the ocean about a boy who was abducted and later found and returned to his home this book is similar in plot but still an interesting read and well written a child who has been missing for 2 years is discovered living in a nearby town when he returns to his family it is not an easy adjustment for anyone everyone celebrates his return but he is a constant reminder of the crime that was perpetrated on him the original crime of his abduction is not over when he is returned as the damage caused seems boundless","731":"it was just ok there was no excitement no thrill just a family trying to put their life back together after a missing son is returned went on too long and the epilogue was completely unnecessary and just confused the issue read it and listened to the audio","732":"on it's own merits i really enjoyed this book it was gripping and raw and beautiful that being said i had a hard time not being annoyed while i read it i've read several raving reviews of this book from well respected sources if the exact same book had been written by a women it would be seen as emotional chick lit and no one would bother to review it","733":"i liked the first half of this book and definitely saw potential but it just didn't go anywhere for me it was okay but nothing mind blowing","734":"the best novel i've read in a long long time a story that draws you in and continually elicits responses and feelings as you read fear recognition satisfaction warmth and unease by turns characters so believable you think you know them dialogue so real you feel you're hearing it and a story paced so well you can't bear to skip a word even though you're dying to read on to find out what happens next full of truths large and small the only character who remains enigmatic to the last is justin the returned kidnap victim and this like everything in this book is as it should be","735":" i had the pleasure of meeting the author and having lunch with him at the recent writers' league of texas conference in which he was a keynote speaker after listening to his amazing and motivational speech i knew i was in for a wonderful read when i started the novel and i wasn't disappointed at johnston's beautiful prose but to tell the truth i almost put the novel down when i knew where he was going with it boy missing a body found the implications of horrific child abuse i just cringed at the thought of the words to come in such an author's hands i'm glad i forged ahead and finished it the subject matter was handled so deftly and in such a uniquely sensitive way that i was enthralled and uplifted at the same time congratulations on an amazing achievement bret anthony johnston your novel deserves all the accolades it has received","736":"wow i devoured this one in just a few short days it picks up where most kidnapping stories end the homecoming it was fascinating to read about it from different family members' perspectives and see their struggles to resume life the characters and setting were so rich i felt as if i was there with them when i was way from the book i couldn't stop thinking about them all the characters drove me to read it as fast as i did i had to follow them until the end","737":"not a fan read like a experiment in pacing gone wrong long flowery passages followed by short chapters from different characters' perspectives interesting premise kid returns to his family after being kidnapped for four years but then nothing happens so much false drama and fake build up","738":"i do not see how this book was voted a bestseller i wanted to quit reading many times","739":"i won this in a firstreads giveaway i'm really glad i did a boy named justin disappears from home for four long years his parents and younger brother wonder and worry about him they replace old flyers with new ones they put up billboards from time to time the police contact his parents to look at a teenager's corpse or meet a teenage run away who might be him the parents get one of those calls a vendor at a flea market called the police to report she's seen an older man with a teenage boy who might be the boy whose face is on those flyers when the police responded to the call the man fled they have the teenage boy in custody this time it is justin so incredibly there is a happy ending but putting the family back together is hard what happened to justin while he was away who is the man what did he do to justin how can his parents and brother stop thinking about the horrible things that justin must have endured how does his family reconnect with justin how does justin reconnect with the people in the town will there be a trial what happens if the man is acquitted and goes free how does the family get back to normal this is an excellent well written book","740":"i admire that bret anthony johnston did not pander to an audience that clamors for salacious details but concentrates on the agony the mother father grandfather and brother are experiencing when their son brother grandson goes missing i think the author did an admirable job of taking us into the lives of that sad family by using various points of view interesting book and very readable but with no answers this is an author to watch","741":" i read this book as an advance copy before interviewing bret anthony johnston it's prose is excellent he's always been praised for that but let me get the non literary nerd's attention this story will change you you owe it to yourself to follow this family through the end of a nightmare and into a stranger reality they're fully realized people they act naturally this entire universe makes sense even at its most horrifying johnston is masterful when it comes to taking away the safety net from his imaginary worlds and seeing his characters through to the end if it doesn't make you an evangelist for his fiction then i don't know what to tell you send me your copy and i'll use it to line my loft's walls to inspire me while i write","742":"touching lovely moving","743":" this is such a great book it moves slowly at times but while doing so it's developing characters and introducing you to the lives of 'normal' people who have experienced a tremendous loss a child who was kidnapped four years ago against all odds is found and returns to his family although the mother father grandfather and other sibling had all struggled in different ways after his disappearance the subsequent changes in the intra family dynamics as they integrate the 'new' son back into their lives is fascinating what made the book so interesting to me were the unasked questions that seemed to be floating around where was the boy all that time what happened to him while he was being held captive who was the kidnapper what will happen to him will there be some sort of retaliation by the family the questions are eventually asked at their own pace and answers are provided but to me that's what propelled me to become totally involved in this novel and to finish it in a long sitting although i'm a voracious consumer of spy novels thrillers police procedurals and other relatively fast paced types of fiction i'll occasionally step outside to read a book like this i can't praise remember me like this enough it's well written characters are developed and you care about them the story is interesting and believable and you just know that suspense is building for some sort of solid ending which does indeed occur i loved it","744":"closer to 4 stars than 3 read my full review here bit ly 1ixc238","745":"bad lots of fluffs repetition very little plot focused more on the immediate aftermath of a child kidnapping boring as heck started skipping after 25% should have read amazon negative review more closely because it said the same thing what a waste of time and money","746":"overall it's a great book even if the 'plot' is driven purely by people not talking to each other i needed to finish the book i cared enough about the characters to worry and cry for them even if i feel like i don't really know the kidnapee or what he went through even after finishing the book there were times i was fed up with all of the imagery and prose that i skimmed or skipped entire paragraphs but i still liked the author's style and pacing ovrall","747":"crazy good a book about a family trying to put itself back together","748":"while i appreciate the writing i felt the book really didn't end or resolve itself in a meaningful or enlightening way it just didn't live up to the promise that it purported to offer","749":"i received a copy of this book from goodreads giveaway program i loved it it was thought provoking the story takes you through each characters feelings as they live each day after the oldest son disappeared then four years later is found and returned very well display of emotions and thoughts for each character i think anyone having experienced some sort of loss in life will relate well","750":"boy missing for 4 years is found in a nearby town and reunites with his family most of the story actually happens after justin is found and centers around how his family struggles to adjust and deals with the upcoming trial of justin's captor there's a lot of description and emotion less dialogue and you're ne maybe more like 2 5 stars based on goodread's rating system it was ok i can see why johnston is a talented writer but i wasn't really gripped by the story the premise is interesting -- boy missing for 4 years is found in a nearby town and reunites with his family most of the story actually happens after justin is found and centers around how his family struggles to adjust and deals with the upcoming trial of justin's captor there's a lot of description and emotion less dialogue and you're never quite sure what justin endured those years he was kidnapped i think that's the point though none of justin's family would be able to relate anyway even if johnston did offer details","751":"i couldn't put it down author describes the area of texas and you feel like you are there smelling feeling and seeing it","752":"this was a powerful very well written novel it never quite goes the way you think and is unique in its perspective what would you do if your 11 going on 12 year old boy went out one day to skateboard and disappeared this novel explores this through the thoughts and actions of the father eric mom laura younger brother grif and grandfather cecil how do you survive the agony of not knowing then the real twist of the story happens when the missing boy justin is found four years later he had been snatched and kept captive in the next town the book delves into how each deals with having their boy returned but not quite the same the only perspective you don't hear is justin's which keeps the book from being a sensational recounting of a horrible crime you imagine if it happened in your family you would celebrate the joy of being reunited and heal together but in truth there is a lot of guilt unspoken feelings anger that each needs to deal with in their own way there is realization that each person is on their own island of loneliness but somehow understanding that the fragile bonds of family are needed to really heal wow as i reflect on this book i think i need to change this to five stars such a well crafted story","753":" remember me like this is a very well written novel about the return of a kidnapped teenage boy four years after his abduction unfortunately it's really not all that interesting after that it has a terrific beginning but never really goes anywhere i don't need a novel to be plot driven to enjoy it but in this case it felt like the story was going to turn on a plot and it never did the character development for all of the main characters is very good except for justin the returned boy who curiously is an enigma as good as the writing was i'm sure that was intentional but it didn't serve the story well all in all a disappointment but i would look for the author again","754":"corpus christi is one of my all time favorite short story collections and the contributions bret anthony johnston has made to literary magazines in the years since that was published are always remarkable so it goes without saying that i was eagerly looking forward to this novel as soon as i heard it would be coming out mr johnston didn't disappoint with his first novel it is a terrific read it has a ripped from the headlines premise a boy goes missing for four years the family has no idea what might have happened to him and no clue whether he is alive or dead then miraculously he is returned to them what makes this not pulp or popular fiction is the author's deliberate choice never to enter the head of the kidnap victim justin and not to offer all the lurid details of how he was treated during his abduction and for that reason when we do get a few details second hand they are all the more devastating instead the novel chooses to focus on the psychological damage done to his family members his father mother brother and grandfather and the emotional hell they have to go through while justin is missing and then it explores all the confusing wrenching emotions they live through when he is returned to them the parents' guilt that they couldn't do more to protect their son hits particularly strong mr johnston has an incredible gift with lyrical prose and unlike most other authors who have that talent he manages to never overdo it not once do you get lost in his words or wonder what all that abstract language is supposed to mean but the majority of the book is told in a beautifully detailed straightforward style that captures with unique voices the interior thoughts of each family member collectively you get an amazing portrait of the family as was the case with his short story collection the setting of the towns around corpus christi becomes like a character itself and the community which lived through this horror along with the family plays an important role as well it's a marvelous literary achievement and the characters come alive on the page you feel like you're living through their turmoil right alongside them it has the same power as another novel that was also one of my favorites from the past few years christopher coake's you came back about a father who is lead to believe the ghost of his dead son has returned to his former house do not hesitate to add remember me like this to your reading list and if you see a notice for a reading from the author in your area be sure to attend mr johnston is ancharming funny and affable man who puts on a very entertaining show","755":" a 'typical' american family is rocked when their eldest son goes missing from their small texas town 4 years later he is found in a neighboring town this well told story is of the aftermath where the 'happy ending' to their tragedy is really just the beginning of what everyone including the reader hopes will be a recovery the author captures the depth of emotions the lies and the truths and all of the turmoil experienced by husband wife both sons grandpa and a girlfriend so well wonderfully written with some incredibly poetic sentences that capture an insight into the soul of people who are not quite done with trauma and heartbreak","756":"wasn't expecting to get into it much less be so moved by it","757":"i loved this book it was very intense and moving","758":"great story as long as you don't read the epilogue","759":"i won this book from a first reads giveaway here on goodreads remember me like this explores what happens to a family after their son is returned from being kidnapped and abused for 4 years the dialogue fleshed out characters compelling storyline and beautiful prose make this book well worth reading the first half of the book is near perfection in the second half i felt as though the story fell apart a bit and became harder to believe justin whose character seemed to purposely be left flat became even flatter instead of more dynamic which felt like a bit of a broken promise i spent a lot of time expecting big ripples from the transition this family goes through but they never really happen the criminal consequences for such a crime were not based in reality even for texas and it was harder to follow why some characters would make the choices they did why would setting an abductor free in mexico be preferable to going through a trial in anyone's mind overall i really enjoyed this i will recommend this to others and look forward to whatever else johnston writes","760":" a few years ago i started avoiding imperiled children i wasn't always so callous i'd wept for susie salmon in \"the lovely bones\" and cheered for jack in \"room \" but suffering kids are an easy way to extort emotional thrills from readers if you're not careful your bookshelf starts to look like a row of old milk cartons each with a child's plaintive headshot staring out as maureen corrigan once noted in our pages \"in too much of contemporary american literature -- high and low -- the story line concerns kidnapping pederasty and the torture of children \"bret anthony johnston's first novel \"remember me like this \" initially gives every indication that he's trudging down that gruesome old path in a brief prologue joggers in corpus christi tex see a body floating in the bay \"none of them thought of justin campbell \" johnston writes \"the boy who'd gone missing years before \" then as the story begins we immediately meet justin's parents eric and laura who've been hollowed out by four years of looking for their son their marriage desiccated by anguish eric is having an affair while laura tends ailing dolphins at a marine laboratory the amber alerts have fallen silent the photocopies have blown off telephone poles and cable new reporters have lost interest neighbors stare at the campbells as though they're burn victims their faces \"mottled and waxy with misfortune \"but johnston who directs the creative writing program at harvard isn't going to retell the story of a child's murder or a family's grief fueled incineration to read the rest of this review go to the washington post http www washingtonpost com enterta","761":"i was a goodreads first reads winner of remember me like this it surrounds the campbell family their son justin disappeared four years ago when he was eleven now four years later justin reappears now the campbell family pick up from when justin is found little is given away about those four years and what justin may have gone through each of the family members are trying to put one foot in front of the other along with those who are related or know the family this book leaves the readers wondering what may have happened during the missing years not a lot is given away a well written book that leaves the readers thinking about the campbell family glad i got the chance to read this book by bret anthony johnston","762":"this book fell between a 2 and 3 for me but i rounded up because i think the book was on an interesting topic i feel that the author could have explored the topic more though i disagree with the synopsis of this book having the pace of a thriller it moved pretty slow for me this is silly but i'm annoyed when people respond with do what and that made it in this book several times which i found odd just an ok book","763":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i loved every bit of this book the south texas setting and johnston's clear love of skateboarding make me feel right at home skating backyard pools in austin or trying all day to land a trick down some gap were moments that fueled my life in texas however this book is more than just marina rails and shout outs to whataburger i couldn't put this book down because i love how these

night at his friends houses because he didn't want his parents waking up to another missing kid really made me love this character and i couldn't help rooting openly and out loud to the people on the bus next to me for fiona and him to make it all work the last one hundred or so pages were impossible to stop reading i was traveling in cambodia at the time and my eyes were glued to the pages while we were driving up to kulen mountain i don't regret any of the cool things i may have missed on the drive up because this book was just so good and because i saw them on the way down anyway more","764":"beautiful writing","765":"i think this might have been a 5 star due to the writing still i kept waiting for something to happen it did not in the grand shoot em up car crash sort of way but in a quieter more subtle way and in the end i won't tell you who did it because i'm not sure this is the story of a family putting itself back together again and if you think it ends in a happily ever after mode you weren't paying attention","766":"there can be disturbances of every kind eating disturbances disturbances in his sexuality and attachments disturbances in fear based behavior victims of childhood trauma often won't have the vocabularies to describe their emotions i have been working with abused children for 30 years johnston's description of a family trying to heal from a traumatic ordeal is spot on beautifully written nuanced and heart stopping this is neither clinically rendered nor a potboiler rather as it says in the book description this book begins where others tend to end `happy ever after' after a rescue from an abduction is not this book's premise this deals with post traumatic afflictions of family after one of the sons justin who was kidnapped at age eleven returns four years later roxanne gay's 2014 novel of ptsd an untamed state concerned the kidnapping captivity and post rescue of a young mother and how it affected all the family members that book started with the amplified action and graphic displays of trauma and later moved into the more nuanced territory however johnston's book is consistently understated there are no overt atrocities if anything johnston curtailed the gruesome events and delicately implied what we tacitly understand about the trauma allowing the reader to interpret and move on from the headline grabbing type of action and into the deeper recesses of the emotional wounds that is what this is about how a family's life is permanently altered from the events an upheaval that requires therapy and time her life everyone's life seemed rigged with trapdoors and hidden collapsible walls panels that would open without warning and claim what had been yours claim it only because you'd allow yourself to believe it couldn't be claimed justin's parents laura and eric his grandfather cecil and his younger brother griff all possess their own turmoil after justin comes home johnston reveals the contrast of before and after how their lives have been capsized in innumerable ways and especially he depicts the isolation that each family member feels and the way they walk on ice to give a wide berth to each others' fragility but we feel the tension of that ice about to crack johnston's luminous use of extended metaphors such as conveyed in laura's volunteer work with ailing or impaired dolphins invariably brings it home to the central premise johnston's prose is flawless and every passage is organic and lucid he doesn't put too fine a point on things allowing the reader to translate what is revealed to what is not he tells you enough but does not telegraph events there isn't one inauthentic moment in this novel his descriptions of corpus are so ripe that i felt that i was there as i have been numerous times as a tourist he brought the city into sharp relief the harbor bridge the brackish water and the townspeople and he sets up a suspenseful plot line in the prologue which keeps us on tenterhooks until the very end this is mesmerizing writing and i am not using hyperbole when i say that johnston is easily one of the top 1% of american writers living today i am astonished that this is his debut novel but he does have short story collections under his belt no wonder he is harvard's creative writing director if you only read a handful of books this year consider remember me like this","767":"yes lots of repetitious passages pertaining to victims' thoughts and insights regarding abduction then recovery of child yet book held my attention","768":"gripping emotional novel about a missing teen and how his return after four years affects his family great descriptions of place and person","769":"absolutely fabulous brimming with emotional authenticity wonderful writing that creeps up on you and won't let go","770":"great characters and wonderful suspense in this well written thriller i could not put it down until i read the last words","771":" bret anthony johnston's debut novel is a compelling character driven family saga rendering the ways in which members of a family struggle with losing and then finding again a son who has gone missing for four years johnston uses a shifting third person limited point of view in which each family member save the son justin convey their thoughts and feelings enhancing the psychological complexity of losing and finding a son and brother after four years have passed the writing gleams with emotional truth and while there is the reality of darkness and despair there is also the promise of renewal and hope after loss","772":"i couldn't put the book down for about the first 2 3rds of the book but then it lost the momentum the one person that you really want to hear from in the book is the victim i wanted more from the victim and his perspective still a good read","773":"it was ok don't know what all the fuss was about","774":"young teen missing for 4 years returns i kept thinking something interesting would be revealed about his captivity or his reentry back into life with his family and community it wasn't","775":" i received a free copy of this book to review through the goodreads first reads program remember me like this is a novel about a family's experience after a son has gone missing and once he's returned justin is missing and people in the community at first work to help laura and eric find their son after a handful of years a woman at a flea market recognizes the boy and he is returned to his family he had been kidnapped and kept in a town not far from home the man who kidnapped him is arrested but eventually released on bail to his parents i wanted to rate this book somewhere between 2 5 and 3 stars the book is decently written and it is interesting to read about the different perspectives on the situation and its changes by justin's parents brother and grandfather my biggest complaint is that nothing much happens the preceding paragraph really does capture pretty much all that happens save for a spoiler from the end that i won't give away the book is a lot of internal thoughts details on small actions logic of the various characters but not much in the way of actual activity dialogue or even very much interaction between characters not to say there isn't any but it is limited and where it does happen it still seems very much like non action not a bad book but definitely not one i would ever read and one that was a bit of sluggish to get through","776":"this was hard to read but ultimately rewarding in the end in the vein of lovely bones mr johnston postulates what would happen if an abducted child returned years later well written and riveting","777":" this book is all about peopel and relationships under stress it's not action it's all dialogue and thought i've often wondered how parents and victims get over a situation like this and i found this book quite convnicing in it's depiction the writing is convincing and keeps you firmly interested in what is happening to this family the 'resolution'at the end is satisfying in that it is believable and convincing regardless of your wishes for the characters i personally considered it under the circumstances to be a happy ending if you want a story that is beautifuuly written convincing and thought provoking whilest always entertaining i would recommend this highly","778":"yawn tooooo looooong i abandoned it after parents flipped out about kidnapped being released","779":"remember me like this chronicles a family as they adjust to the return of their kidnapped son justin was kidnapped when he was 11 or so and remained captive for four years we are introduced to the family and how they are disintegrating b c of justin's disappearance but much more of the book is devoted to how they must adapt after his return and how they deal with the many repercussions a good book but not great","780":" my thoughtsthis book hit home because we had a very similar situation occur in our general area a young boy goes missing only to be \"found\" four years later i still remember thinking wow i wonder what that whole experience was like for this young boy and his family obviously i can't answer that on a personal basis but i get the feeling that this author has probably come fairly close to hitting the nail on the head he writes about the people who were left to deal with the sudden disappearance of justin the mom and dad a younger brother and a grandfather how their grief is tearing their world apart how they don'y know if they should give up or hold on to hope forever and then justin is found oh the joy the disbelief the yest to be asked and answered questions the writing was compelling this is a story that unfolds slowly and by the end my stomach was in knots it was wonderful my thanks to random house via netgalley for allowing me to read this in exchange for an unbiased review","781":"this review can also be found on my blog https autonomynyc wordpress com remember me like this a novel that i personally will remember as being very unique this book is centered around the disappearance and return of sixteen year old justin campbell but not once does johnston let us into the thoughts of the oldest campbell son instead he writes in the voices of justin's younger brother griffin justin's morose father eric his crumpling mother laura and his ailing grandfather cecil besides what justin chooses to divulge out loud to any of the other characters in this novel what truly happened to him in the four years of his disappearance remains a mystery to all readers johnston chooses to focus instead on the circumstances surrounding a broken family and what caused them both to shatter and heal i don't believe i have read a mystery book where details of the actual mystery remain just that a mystery throughout the entire thing i do wish that i had a bit more insight into what exactly happened during justin's four years away the other part of me gives a little grudgingly credit to johnston for an accomplished attempt at a unique perspective in terms of the plot i have to admit i was disappointed reading this book was a little like eating an apple a good looking shiny new apple at first bite it's delicious savory even but as you continue to bite into the apple you realize that its bruised and damaged inside it's still a decent apple if you can ignore the \"tainted\" spots but the point is your apple while perfect at first bite failed to follow through from the core to the end in the same way remember me like this has a \"damaged bruised\" middle the beginning was absolutely captivating an amazing way to start a book and to grab the reader's attention right away it seemed that johnson's use of descriptive language would absolutely make the reader fall in love with the entire book however it took a turn for the \"3 5 stars\" as the action started to slow down and the scenes began to drag out the descriptive language became too descriptive the inner workings of the characters seemed to become extremely repetitive and unnecessary for example johnson seemed to prolong the inner conflict of cecil a character that while important did not provide much to the story as a whole i gave this book 3 5 stars because while i easily admit that there were several flaws within the plot it was quite enthralling to enter the world of the campbell family who had experienced more than anyone could ever imagine i got through this quickly finished it in a day it's not a difficult book to read but any reader who can't stand some overly descriptive language shouldn't attempt this book during a busy day or week","782":"such a realistic portrayal of a family and their emotional roller coaster i was enthralled with their imperfections no unrealistic super heroes here johnston's prose and descriptions of places and smells transported me right into the book being from corpus christi this book was like going home well done mr johnston","783":" thank you to random house for the advance copy i've long admired bret anthony johnston's work because he tells real stories without gimmicks or twirly bits he understands that in our world twists and turns truly happen and if you're watching and listening close enough you'll experience these wonders remember me like this uses the foundation of a headline event and allows us to go inside around and between it the characters fly without a net just like we all do and in this knowing it's easy to relate to them and experience the large and small moments of their world in this experience perhaps we can treasure these same moments of our worlds johnston doesn't smother a reader with big showy life lessons yet through gentle insightful storytelling they appear regardless","784":"i didn't even finish this book too rough a story too dragged out","785":"this book wasn't particularly well written but it held an air of melancholy that kept me intrigued

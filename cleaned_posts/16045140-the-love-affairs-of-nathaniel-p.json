the headline for my review is chick lit in drag i like the premise of this one and i admire a good bit of the writing but i was ultimately disappointed with it the idea behind it is that a woman writes about a man's perspective on the contemporary dating life he lacks any clear ability to reflect on why or how he's attracted to women and as a consequence he hurts a lot of them the persistent question of the book is what makes nathaniel tick that makes the premise almost necessarily narcissistic which might work if nathaniel were as interesting as he thinks he is instead even though he writes about various cultural insights and social problems he ultimately finds himself pretty dry of ideas he makes it clear he doesn't want to talk about his relationships but almost all the exchanges of consequence turn on just those questions in the end then the ventriloquism of the premise fails nathaniel's lips may be moving but the perspective is finally that of the women to whom he can never fully explain himself","2":"i felt that i was the wrong demographic to read this book i admired waldman's ability to write from a male point of view but itwas not a novel that captured my interest rather it dragged me along","3":"it definitely grabbed me sucked me in at the same time it was a bit too much of the girls this and boys that talk it could have been written 30 years ago which is not the author's fault she did an amazing job it is just a huge disappointment that people still think a lot of the cliches are true so there might be something to it or not it is just the stories we tell each other over and over again it makes me want to puke i don't even know which one is worse","4":"acceptable for chic lit nothing earth moving fun quick read","5":"this book had an interesting premise romances of a man narrated by a woman but it did not meet my expectations the characters were mostly unlikable and the writing style and redundant descriptions of conversation were not my favorite however it describes many personal relationships more realistically than other works of fiction out there currently and there were more intriguing thoughts in the last third of the story","6":"the people who populate this book are often preposterous but they also felt incredibly real to me i simultaneously empathized with them and wanted to punch them all in the face very entertaining and oddly touching read","7":"debut novelist adelle waldman has an uncanny talent of describing women through the eyes of a man the love affairs of nathaniel p is essentially in the words of reviewer sasha weiss a mercilessly clear view into a man's mind as he grows tired of a worthy woman women readers must find the journey into the male mind infuriating i found it to be fascinating and slightly troubling how is it that a woman can describe my subconscious behavior toward women better than myself who told her all the secrets this isn't a book that i would recommend to everyone some of my friends would find it intellectually snobbish others would say of the characters no one really talks like that but then those friends haven't spent time with ivy league humanities grads slumming it in brooklyn 90% of american men are clueless to the fact that there is a foreign land where attractive well dressed sophisticated women fight for the attention of bookish introverted men this foreign land is called new york and it must be a terrible place to be a woman looking for love my assumption is that many of these women move to new york for professional ambition or because they watched too much felicity growing up but eventually as nathaniel p observes in his thirties everything was different the world seemed to be populated to an alarming degree by women whose careers whether soaring or sputtering along no longer preoccupied them no matter what they claimed they seemed in practice to care about little except relationships the first three fourths of this book could have been written by a modern urbanite hemingway only toward the end does it become occasionally clear that its author is a woman my hunch based on the most popular kindle highlights is that the majority of readers are women as well that shouldn't keep men away it's a surreal and satisfying experience to peer into the male mind from a woman's point of view","8":"i walked away from this book extremely self conscious of the way i come off to men let's hope they're not all as self centered as nathaniel p","9":"i am surprised i liked this book as much as i did it has so many elements of novels i do not like but i couldn't stop listening of course it may be most entertaining to that subset of the population that has been embroiled in the 30 something urban dating world you will say yep been there to me there was so much honesty in this novel that is what moved me i didn't love the ending as it seemed so much less explored than the rest of the novel but that choice says something as well","10":"i went to see adelle waldman speak about this book at dc's politics u0026amp prose bookstore before i read this book only being familiar with reviews and having it on my 'to read' shelf from the questions asked by audience members and the general reviews it was clear that this book was about gender i'm in grad school for women's studies so i gravitate towards anything that looks to complicate gender stereotypes in popular fiction this didn't disappoint in fact i think this book is much more complicated in its examination of gender that what is generally suggested in the reviews waldman is a woman writing from a white upper middle class cismale perspective through the eyes of nate nate deals with relationship problems throughout the book and he chalks it up at first to being 'messed up' but i would say that nate isn't messed up nate while critical of overt social structures and being able to 'logically' point out sexism is a vessel towards understanding just how complicated sexism is if a woman's arm's jiggle how should we react we know how we should feel in seeing a beauty flaw but how do we really feel why is it such a turn on to physically take up more space than the woman you're seeing what's so important about being able to reach all the way around her and encompass her petite frame why are we not happy when we get the things we want as i finished this book i felt completely satisfied in where i left nate and where i found myself waldman said she found it interesting that some people found this a happy ending some a sad ending but i think as complicated as the characters are and the depth to which waldman reaches in the development of nate and the people with whom he interacts each person will find something different in the book depending on where they see themselves whatever my gender or the gender of the characters i was reminded with chagrin of times that i acted like nate and embarrassment of times that i was a hannah and in the end seeing some of nate's revelations helped me come to terms with some of my own personality flaws and relationship failures last note at the event waldman said that if nate had written this book it would have been about his work and not about his relationships and now i wonder how nate would feel if he read this book would he learn things about himself or would he excuse his behavior i wish i knew","11":"this was fun though frankly also depressing at times the plot felt a little static but as it's a deep look into the psyche of the modern single man i suppose she needed that space to let his thoughts and choices simmer some of the prose felt a little too dense if this was intended to make the reader feel as foreign to new york's literati scene as nate felt beholden to it then mission accomplished waldman's nate confirmed my most depressing hunches about the mind's of current day single men whether we're both right or just hack wannabe psychologists with similar axes to grind i don't know but nate is as deplorable as is he recognizable and i started to resent that throughout the book i kept wondering what's nate going to do a terrifying parallel to the life of a single girl dating who constantly passively feels forced to wonder what's he going to do","12":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i had a really hard time relating to the character the man can't even sit down at a restaurant without feeling like he's being trapped by the conventionalities of a relationship i couldn't believe how he just let emotions pass in an out of him without any examination one minute he'd be annoyed at his girlfriend the next tender without any internal understand he doesn't understand at the end why it works out with another girl and it's because she's able to keep him in check and call him ou i had a really hard time relating to the character the man can't even sit down at a restaurant without feeling like he's being trapped by the conventionalities of a relationship i couldn't believe how he just let emotions pass in an out of him without any examination one minute he'd be annoyed at his girlfriend the next tender without any internal understand he doesn't understand at the end why it works out with another girl and it's because she's able to keep him in check and call him out on when it's not okay to be a jerk my boyfriend said it sounded like a woman trying to write what she thinks guys are like and coming off worse than they actually are more","13":" the love affairs of nathaniel p is a wince inducing novel about a young man who based on two fundamental truths he holds sacrosanct causes a great deal of unhappiness amongst the women he dates the first truth is that he is a nice guy who doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings especially the women whom he has convinced himself are the start of something exciting and new in his life the second truth is that it is way more exciting to be single and he needs to be on constant alert from being wrestled down into a relationship which would lead him to have to compromise himself many reviewers have found the various characters both male and female to be loathsome pretentious hipsters they are not they are young they are not as clever as they may think in certain ways and yes they are stumbling around after some kind of meaning or success however defined which i think sums up most people i ever met in their 20s as someone who lived in new york in my 20s and early 30s i think the author managed to capture the entire conlicted glorious mess of it perfectly with a side dollop of shining wit it may well be that the entire book is completely niche to those who have lived in that tiny self important geographical sub set but on the whole i sincerely hope not after all you don't have to been to an 18th century tea dance in bath to enjoy jane austen i do think it is a universal truth that the desire to be a nice guy has caused more than its fair share of sadness when inevitably the pretense falls","14":"this book truly pissed me off the main character is boring gray u0026amp judgmental but at the same time insecure and has no idea what he wants being in his everyday mind was straight torture i used to think that men knew exactly what they wanted but choose not to verbalized it to women b c many tend to be too emotional to handle honesty u0026amp will take it in a different way but this guy didn't even know what the hell he wanted in his own damn mind he kinda reminded me more of a female than a male in fact i truly could understand what hannah was dealing with as far as not being in the clear while they were together if this is how the modern man is then i am ecstatic that i turned out to be a girl it was also a hard read with the constant use of big words i feel like i needed to carry a dictionary with me u0026amp the conversations he u0026amp his friends had where they always made references to past writers u0026amp philosophers made this book sooooo boring u0026amp dry i can't even think of why i would recommend this to someone except to a male friend to ask is this what you assholes really do","15":"awesome the author really nails the whole how single men treat women thing ok some men but still it's humorously weird parts of your own past relationships echoed in a fictional story ladies you have to read this one","16":" i slogged through this bore for my book club it was apparently highly acclaimed by npr so i kept waiting for something redeeming to happen perhaps nate will have an insight stop objectifying women or show some personal growth when that didn't happen i started waiting for something flashy to occur as they're standing on the rooftop at a party have someone fall off or on their way to yet another restaurant have someone robbed or hit by a taxi anything instead it is just page after page of loathsome self centered blather hated it","17":"this is one of those books that you find yourself strongly disliking the main character but you can't stop reading to see what he will do next or in nate's case how he will break another heart or leave another girl stunned and scarred i found myself being grateful that i am no longer single as i read this book as i think his actions would have gotten under my skin even more it is a well written captivating book that leaves you feeling as insecure as nate leaves the women he dates","18":"really enjoyed this book from first time author adelle waldman she writes from a male's perspective and his various relationships in nyc definitely recommend to anyone in the dating scene as it basically nails every type of dating relationship out there but from the guy's point of view really made me think about my own dating history and i actually cringed at some of the similarities but overall i really enjoyed this modern day literary romance","19":" {excerpt from a longer review on my personal book review blog} nathaniel piven is not your average 30 something brooklynite literary nerd nor your dime a dozen shallow pretentious competitive and flaky ex boyfriend material business boy living in new york or at least that's what he thinks this funny and involving novel about nate's romantic entanglements and their repercussions for his self opinion and life offers a poignant glimpse at the way the modern metro man thinks lives and loves as well as explores contemporary gender dynamics in a way that is refreshing unabashed and spoken with both conviction and honesty the authorial voice proved to be my favorite element of this book nathaniel though a bit of a douche as a great number of goodreads reviewers have found to be an issue is a well formed and richly developed douche displaying the full spectrum of emotion and range of thought in an unfamiliar way making reading his thoughts similar to taking a field trip into the inner workings of a mind i've never encountered most interestingly the strength of voice drudged up the very pertinent question for a novel that especially delineates and is forced to contend with the messy tangles of men and women mentality and status in interpersonal relationships how much of this is playing into previously crafted tropes of what is distinctly masculine and feminine this superb quality of the style of writing really forced a weighing of archetypes and i really appreciated that added undercurrent of questionability and mental effort to hold the author accountable to her characters the characters themselves both men and women were similarly complex and developed they all served distinct purposes of course but couldn't be argued into stock character corners they furnished the story line without becoming mere furniture themselves i can only guess that they were probably at least partially constructed from the bones of real people they constantly challenged existing preconceptions about how these city dwelling 30 somethings would act or behave in both truth and through satire it was at least partially an almost dry and wry satire of those classically imagined lives of the young and brilliant in new york city but leaned more towards the sympathetic than the obvious it was more intuitive and self aware than over blown or desperately self acknowledging and what i've said previously about the characters directly contrasts what you'd expect in a typical satire it's just that while the novel itself lent directly to challenge the contemporary grand narrative there will still areas where the story fit puzzle piece like directly into the predicted pattern of such things but did so with a wink and a smile adelle waldman has written a deep and yet humorous and spectacularly crafted and intuitive account of the effect of one brief romance in the string of many love affairs of nathaniel p offering an intriguing study of what is man and what is woman and more interestingly what electric friction happens between the two in the lively literary sets of brooklyn upstarts the novel is clear and quick in pace which when combined with the debut author's frank and unapologetic writing style results in a simultaneous humor and elegance that you don't necessarily find in many contemporary novels","20":"while waldman's writing was quite good it was what kept me from abandoning this book the protagonist was so odious that it was not as enjoyable to read as it should have been ron charles from the washington post was correct in his assessment that it reads like the passive aggressive playbook of bright young men i'm looking forward to her next novel","21":" loathsome that is the best word to describe the pretentious self absorbed and self congratulatory emotionally stunted protagonist of this novel smarmy that is how i would describe the entire novel the entire thing left me feeling as if i needed a shower my major complaints are listed below in no particular order 1 the main character is loathsome 2 the author though female appeared to hate women 3 if she used the word gentrification one more time i may have smothered her in her own self satisfaction 4 the entire lot of characters were a bunch of winy arrogant hipster douchebags and i generally shy away from using slang in literature reviews but i just hated this book that much 5 the callous and insensitive reference to people with asperger's syndrome that i thought was ludicrous 6 back to the gentrification for all the repeated use of this 50 cent sat word the author sure did enjoy heaping on the racial and cultural stereotypes what spoiler 7 the ending made no freakin' sense was it satire that i just didn't get there was no character resolution when we last see nate he is engaged in what i would determine to be a dysfunctional cyclic feeding of codependent egos was that supposed to be a happy ending or were we meant to be left with the impression that once a douche always a douche ugh this book absolutely infuriated me i wanted to bail about halfway through but i held on hoping for some iota of redemption if i had taken the time to peak at the author's self satisfied and ironic dust jacket photo i would have known not to waste my time damn hipsters","22":"entertaining and a fast read this book became much much funnier when i listened to audible's male narrator read it knowing the book was authored by a woman had been messing me up suddenly hearing a man's voice articulate all the sentences i imagined the whole book taking place inside this self absorbed intellectual's dude mind i laughed on every page hilarious and well observed ps i recommend getting the kindle version with the audible audio book tie in i've never read a book like that before i was able to alternate between reading the text and having a professional read it to me as the kindle automatically turns the pages i still hate amazon but i have to admit nice one amazon","23":" the love affairs of nathaniel p henceforth lanp due to exhausting title is a tedious illustration of men's worst tendencies i can't say that i disagree with adelle waldman's depiction of immature millennial new yorker dude as a type and as a target of derision but i was hoping for something more for me lanp started strong with it's lightning round recap of nate's romances and resume but lost steam as we got deeper and deeper into nate's relationship with hannah mild spoiler alert the inevitability of nate and hannah's breakup was obviously the point of the whole thing but also made for a dull read nate's follow up relationship with the author greer cohen forced and out of place despite the obvious foreshadowing made for an unspectacular conclusion overall i suppose lanp just didn't hold much appeal for me because its story arc was just so standard if i were inclined to suffer through a long winded romantic fizzle i would just talk to any of my friends","24":" nathaniel p is a painfully authentic profile of a youngish rising dynamo in the pretentious if not affected brooklyn literary scene nate's internal narrative deliberately unfolds from conversations and engagements both romantic and otherwise as he navigates his desires and the lack thereof professional sexual and emotional waldman's diction is somehow economical and grandiloquent at once a feat which would otherwise be incredibly annoying if it weren't so appropriate for nate's cagey nature okay maybe it's still a little annoying he struggles to find his place amongst the pretentious literarti and attempts to construct his own social narrative free from expectations unfortunately nate is not above the temptations or anxieties of status and we leave him very close to the place we found him the string of one dimensional characters rob the reader of an opportunity of personal investment and the pervasive shallowness both in nate's man child reasoning and in the static plot is nearly unforgivable i wanted to love the love affairs it has all the makings for a great read but none of the follow through while waldeman is often lauded for providing an accurate depiction of a man's internal dialogue and an unsentimental portrait of the elitism present both in and out of the new york literary scene her obvious hesitance to meaningfully delve into the issues belonging to both nate and the world he lives in makes the characters fall flat and the story unsatisfying waldeman is a wordsmith that much is certain the crass conversations and brute honesty are both endearing and entertaining while love affairs shows promise the author's refusal to call nate out on his shit undermines her potential cleverness with that said once the final page was turned and i put nate and his friends to rest i still caught myself wondering about his little pocket of community and the muted women with which he found himself entangled if you're a removed reader who enjoys carefully crafted sentences and impressive vocabularies then you can't let this opportunity pass you by if you're anyone else well don't bother","25":"phenomenal thoughtful writing i really liked the book and found it hard to put down at parts my only complaint is that i like an ending to my books and this one just sort of stops","26":" i was oddly hooked on this book but i'm not sure why because absolutely nothing eventful happens the novel follows along with the many ups and downs of nathaniel's relationships with women throughout his life a review on the back describes nate as a young male you would think you might hate but you don't or at least i didn't but i truly hated nate he is just as self absorbed and pretentious as the friends with whom he speaks so negatively about it's an interesting look inside the male mind well one very odd male but other than that i don't recommend this book","27":"ugh i don't really like books with unsympathetic protagonists like when there's hardly anything redeeming about them at all this book also made me terrified to date","28":"i loved the intellectualization of something so common a love story it felt like a ya novel for an older set i expected a little more from a woman writing from the male perspective if her ability to write from the male perspective as a male sounding author was intentional then she deserves a ten out of five her intentions are difficult to discern additionally the conclusion felt a little forced","29":"this book wandered a lot the protagonist is occasionally interesting often tedious and frequently an asshole it's hard to get behind him or his friends or finally to care what happens to them nonetheless some great observations about women through men's eyes and about what might be called the new literati as much as i disliked this book i'll probably check out waldman's next","30":"it was ok nothing spectacular didn't draw me in too much hence the length of time it took me to finish but characters were unique","31":"impressive how well the female heterosexual author does such a good job conveying the first person perspectives of a heterosexual male very well done also an interesting account of the intellectual elitism that exists in some circles","32":"waldman's writing is excellent and her portrayal of nathaniel is clear and cutting but still affectionate nate is that guy as in he's every guy women who date men will find a lot to talk about and get angry about here","33":" i think that the love affairs of nathaniel p is worth reading simply for the fact that the female author so accurately finds and uses the internal voice of a man the plot is not the main drive of this novel but there is one and it flows nicely it serves as a way for us to hear the internal dialogue of nathaniel and the conversations he has with his friends girlfriend and ex girlfriends this would be considered very good dialogue by anyone but its incredible to see an author go inside the thought process of the opposite sex so convincingly of course this has been done before but this really is a perfect example of it and really worth reading even though the plot is not the most interesting part of this short novel i did actually find it interesting and was interested to see how it would end nathaniel is a writer who has not only a big intellect but a big ego to with it he has dated a few women in the past but the novel focuses on him meeting a new woman and their budding relationship as a 33 year old guy this is normally not the type of plot to keep me turning pages but this book's great dialogue kept me interested in nathaniel and his fate if you like hipster dialog the gentrification of brooklyn and relationship issues check this one out besides its short so its not a huge investment of your time i read it over a weekend","34":" there must have been times when i thought this book was going to be about something as i did read it all the way through i may be simply too old for this book nate is a self absorbed idiot who eventually finds someone inane enough that he can bear to be with her there's a lot of pseudo intellectual conversation which i initially thought might turn into something but it didn't really it just conveyed the general pomposity of most of the male characters then there's the women who are mostly clingy and put up with all kinds of baloney just to keep the relationship afloat by any desperate means ugh i have never know people like this and for that i am grateful","35":" well that was pointless does it really take an entire book to get across the fact that relationships sometimes don't work out especially if you are a self absorbed self centered wanker who doesn't feel like putting any work into them two stars only because the characters did feel extremely real if mostly unlikable though i liked hannah and was sad as she got more and more diminished in her relationship with nate which is an interesting facet of that relationship i have felt myself acting the same and it's not great so kudos to the author's ability to create incredibly realistic characters and animate them so well and because now i'm petrified that my friends analyze me as harshly as nate does his friends i have now talking myself into thinking that it was a love hate relationship i had with this book actually i see the high quality of what the author created but ultimately i didn't enjoy it regardless of the quality","36":"intellectually stimulating adelle waldman's valiant and i think successful attempts to dive into the mind and moral compass of a 21st century literary brooklyn ite are admirable and intriguing a somewhat bleak while at times humorous social commentary on the importance of relationships family friends and most importantly loves i felt at times both defeated and hopeful a reflection on waldman's challenging and quick wit and structure","37":" was it balzac or flaubert who wrote that the novel is a mirror traveling down the highway or zola regardless waldman's social criticism of the state of relationships reflects back the ennui of upper middle class brooklynites and their faulty relationships what i saw reflected back to me in the image of nathaniel was a intelligent but inept man who needs to climb over the ivy cluttered wall of his ego to exist in any relationship nathaniel uses his selfishness as a harry potter invisibility cloak and covers up his vulnerability with it hiding it even from himself when he wears his cloak he can escape any commitment in any relationship i didn't really like this novel but really respect it waldman has razor sharp precision in writing engaging dialogue and her character portraits i found disturbing but i give art permission to disturb me to confront me and this novel made squirm because i did not want to be a 'guy' like nathaniel he could really be an a hole and i like to think that i never am bump it up a star then read it too and let me know if nathaniel's compulsion for selfishness rings or wrings you","38":"not much happens in this book but by god the writing is fucking brilliant","39":"hilarious frustrating dead on","40":"it's not you it's him my favorite book i read this summer in a few days it would be as if this night never happened the only evidence of it an unsent e mail automatically saved to his drafts folder dear hannah he'd no more remember the pain or the pleasure of this moment than he would remember once he moved into the new apartment the exact scent of the air from his bedroom window at dawn after he'd been up all night working","41":" this book delves into the mind of one nathaniel p a self centered writer from brooklyn specifically it explores his relationships with women and ladies the mind of this man is as bad as you might imagine when having dinner one night with his under 30 year old girlfriend his eye is drawn to of all things the flabbiness of her upper arms of course this is a major turn off to him as if he were an adonis if you want to explore one's mind exploration of women this is the book for you of course it was written by a woman so you must take it with a few grains of salt yes much of it rings true but i think most men do not give their relationships half the thought process that this guy does maybe that's a good thing given the way his mind thinks anyway i enjoyed it but it's a very urban kind of 'inside the literary' scene type of book so please keep that in mind probably not for everyone","42":"this reminded me of the young adult book i recently read the sentences and the character just lacked sophistication it's hard to exactly delineate what makes good writing and what makes amateur writing but it's easy to recognize in the reading in this case i might have liked the book a little more if waldman had spent less time early on laboring over how awful nate is she needed a save the cat scene to make me like him instead he felt like a one dimensional character like a woman who met a bad guy tried to write a novel about him and could only imagine him sitting around objectifying women in the end it just wasn't fun to read","43":"i found this book to be rather enjoyable but a hard book to review objectively i thought that this book had several issues that could detract from its enjoyment the characters and world that it depicts is a rather insular one the brooklyn literary scene among 25 35 year old heterosexual singles and the writing was good but nothing that stands out the final thing that was hard for me to judge was the depiction of the protagonist i found it extremely interesting that a female author wrote a book that is essentially a singular male's view on his relationships that at least for me was a big part of what i found interesting about this novel however especially early on in the story some parts rang slightly untrue from my not far removed experiences as a young single male despite those quibbles by the end of the book i was pretty drawn into this character study and i really liked what the author did with his trajectory i would suggest this novel to anyone who thinks that they would enjoy a story about such a specific topic","44":"informative","45":"i think all of us have met a nate p at some point in our lives this was painful to read and sometimes infuriating it inspired a lot of internal self reflection i'd recommend it to any person my age","46":"after i read this book all i could think about was thank god i'm done dating when i started it i have to go back to the cover several times to check if the book author was a woman she did a great job and i wonder who was she among the characters we encounter in her book","47":"i really despised this book the main character was such an asshole it reminded me too much of my life and the horrible dudes i met during and after graduate school i read through 2 3rds of it put it down for a month then quickly thumbed through the ending before i returned it to the library i couldn't bring myself to spend any more time with him or his people","48":"this book gets two stars only because i suffered through it to the end without throwing in the towel mid way through and was genuinely interested in what happened to this modern day jerk waldman does not seem to like her protagonist he had almost no redeeming characteristics at all not only did i dislike nate almost more than any other main character in any book ever the characters in general were pretentious and snobby i obviously wasn't a fan and wouldn't recommend it","49":"thought provoking for anyone single and dating in brooklyn","50":"overall i really did enjoy the book but i had strong urges to punch out every individual character","51":"gosh this book is a bit terrifying i kind of want all my male friends to read it and report back because i suspect this is how women of a certain type think that men of a certain type think but hopefully that's not accurate anyway closely observed highly entertaining anxiety inducing","52":" i'm confused about this book ron charles gave it a five star rating i've heard how wonderful a first novel it is and i really liked the way waldman writes her writing is very insightful and honest but when i finished tlaonp i sort of felt the same sad way i feel when i watch girlss sad and confused about the 30 somethings of today the author says it best this book is about a decadent new yorker who whiles away his time on self indulgent personal drama it just makes me glad that i'm not dating and would never want to engage in that activity ever again if it in any way resembled the life of nathaniel p hopefully waldman can put her obvious talent to something with a little more meaningful next time around","53":"well written ironically entertaining","54":"waldman's rather distant intellectual account of modern relationships never failed to capture my attention or my recognition her characters are completely realistic in their flaws as is the narrative in general while i didn't leave this story with a great sense of fondness for any of it i appreciated that it presented a specific portrait of a certain type of bright young thing and enjoyed the journey","55":"this was a well written book but i only gave it 3 stars because i found the protagonist so snobbish self important and condescending it was like hanging out with someone you can't stand","56":" i was pretty tempted to dismiss adelle waldman's the love affairs of nathaniel p as one of those annoying pointless books steeped in its own brooklynness and thus published because if there's anything brooklyn writers like to read and heap with effusive praise it's a book about brooklyn barf as a citizen of the internet and an avid reader i've made a conscious choice to actively avoid the whole brooklyn literati thing it's entirely too twee and self congratulatory for my midwest sensibilities also i have yet to be wholly impressed by anything it has produced read more","57":"tale of the dating woes of a modern day literary brooklynite d bag amusing at times cringeworthy at others","58":"it's been a while since i've hated a character this much beautifully written","59":"there was some fine writing in it but it was unfulfilled","60":"a must read i quote from the blurb the love affairs of nathaniel p is super smart well observed funny sad adelle waldman writes about men better than most men josh radnor","61":" if i wanted to listen to a self centered emotionally immature thirtysomething guy whine about commitment there are plenty of ex boyfriends and former lovers i could have called up for a chat i get what adelle waldman is trying to do with this story and with the character of nate piven i just don't think she does so in a particularly engaging or thoughtful manner and it's not as if the premise is original or innovative nor is the literary trick of a woman writing from a man's perspective all too impressive","62":"oh my i never thought i would be this harsh on any book character but nate is all in all u0026amp throughly an ass it was sometimes hard to continue reading the book and i had to take breaks i would have given the book 2 stars because i hated nate so but given that this male character was written by a woman so well makes it worth the additional star if all men were indeed this self absorbed and cynical it would be impossible for relationships to last","63":" this is one of the better contemporary novels that i've read about the selfish grasping and self confidence crippling decade after college waldman raises an important modern question why should the privileged white male urbanites do the hard thing when doing the easy thing gets them what they want without the hassle even moral imperatives can be rationalized when viewed from a position of privilege nate the everyman hipster narrator has the potential to do better and be better because he does have moments of clarity and self reflection but he inevitably takes the easy route and then justifies and rationalizes his choice overall this is a clear eyed and cleverly done send up of the rationalizations white privilege affords in the guise of a book about relationships","64":"preferably i would have given this novel 3 1 2 stars but alas not an option the book definitely was a bit slow and possibly gratuitous in nathaniel's constant musings but a grain of truth was always there somewhere walkman appears to be a bit of a writer in the line of austen or at her most interesting wharton would give this book a spin if you had a chance and i can even see myself reading her next work","65":"while the introspections of a self involved hipster and his romantic travails does not seem like the sort of book that would grab me i'm glad i looked past my initial reservations and dove in nathaniel is of course deeply annoying but annoying in a way that perfectly captures the inner world of upper middle class people with no actual problems who somehow still can't quite manage to get their lives together funny and acerbic with a few slings that strike rather close to home","66":"i will start with the good stuff waldman has an engaging writing style her prose is both breezy and smart not the easiest combo she knows literary hipster brooklyn really well and provides a great setting she also developed one interesting and dimensional character sadly that character is not nate i think the author set out to write a book in the tradition of authors like philip roth and john updike but with more depth of character what would it look like if we could see inside of nathan zuckerman's or harry angstrom's head unfortunately i think that was a fool's errand what is inside of zuckerman or angstrom or nathaniel p is pretty much what is on the outside of zukerman or angstrom or nathaniel p i am not saying men are not deep or that men are all alike what i am saying is that a certain kind of man a narcissist who thinks about what image he is projecting rather than being a good man doesn't have the kinds of inner battles that nate fights in this book nate is both jaded and callow that seems like a paradox but when you experience a lot and never grow as a person that is what happens waldman tries to make nate complex but he's a simple man he cares about his writing and he cares about how he is perceived he cares about getting laid he cares about feeling important without actually doing anything of import nate wrestling with himself as he does for most of this book is simply untrue to the character hannah was kind of great though i liked hannah i want to read her story i think waldman would write it very well","67":" this is a smart novel about an intelligent man who is also kind of a silly little boy nate us a jewish left leaning liberal living in new york at 35 he has worked himself through a string of relationships with mildly successful beautiful women living in new york when he starts dating another he is struck by the benign ness of the experience and of his emotions for a woman even he can see is certainly girlfriend material you really don't want to love nate's character but he ends up becoming a bit of a guilty pleasure he has this incredible ability to simply walk out of a situation when he realizes it isn't going to go his way usually there's a woman crying involved it's fun to step inside the current new york literary scene which is about as banal as you'd imagine high intellectuals paying rent by writing weekly health roundups for websites and the such interspersed by readings and trips to coffee shops nothing much happens in the book which you have to understand is simply the point it's just a snapshot of one man's mildly successful life but with closer observation it's a delight it's a fun first novel and adele waldman is absolutely a writer to watch she even got me to read svevo","68":"if everytime you watch girls you smile but thank your stars you are no longer in your 20s dealing with god awful men in squalid apartments this book is for you i couldn't help but picture lena durham's swarmy boyfriend as i read this adele waldman manages to portray in nate all the angst and frustration of a self absorbed but undoubtedly smart over educated 30 something writer in brooklyn what makes it great is that nate isn't a one sided character he actually has moments of clear self perception but that he manages to brush away quickly and go on his misogenic path like nails on a chalk board some of the time as you see nate treat horribly the only woman who gets him but also full of vision into the privileged world of the literati and the wannabes in brooklyn today","69":"this book is really well written to the point that it is hard to believe it is written by a woman with a man as the first person narrator however its hard to like the man that she has created","70":"this book is smart about gender dynamics specifically the type that keep promising literary men succeeding while their girlfriends worry about their sexual marketability at the expense of their intellectual potential i also appreciated the way characters were defined by their ideas for essay topics this was creative and original ultimately however this book gets me no closer to learning how one actually makes a living as a freelance writer which i realize was not its purpose but suggests that once again a writer has shrouded the economics of hipster lives in mystery","71":"i forced myself to read through this book because it had been so hyped up despite some very skilled phrasing this book was such a disappointment being trapped inside an unfunny dislikable character's head with nothing going on is really not very interesting but if you live in brooklyn the social analysis will likely amuse and depress","72":" i was looking for something light but intelligent after the last several novels this was certainly light but it was incredibly disappointing after its rave reviews i may be overly naive in thinking that this young female writer's dissection of the young would be intellectual hipster brooklyn gentrifying 30 something male is overly simplistic maybe sadly it is on point but the novel's accuracy would not redeem it it doesn't wink at the pretentiousness and preciousness of its protagonists it refers to one street not sarcastically not ironically as myrtle once known as murder avenue there are references to hester prynne and brainy smurf in the same dialogue and there is a disdain for women that one senses is supposed to be an indictment of the latent misogyny of nathaniel p but seems to truly animate the story in the end the characters and their story are familiar and incredibly boring the author's attempt at a realistic depiction of her main character means one is left with a shallow insipid protagonist who even after endless attempts to explore his own psyche and that of his lovers remains willfully blind as to his own desires and intentions this same protagonist inspires at best indifference and at worst rage that one has spent $6 99 and a few hours of one's life on this endeavour","73":" a great book about a very particular type of man in a very particular time in history in a very particular place which manages to both nail all of those specifics and still have universal lessons and ideas about art masculinity and casual cruelty people are capable of to each other especially those with the intellectual capacity to justify nearly anything nate a self perceived good guy living in brooklyn and getting ready for the publication of his first novel is shown through the history of his life and relationships he spends his time writing reviews and disposable think pieces going to parties moping and feeling guilty while doing nothing much to make the world a better place the novel focuses on one relationship the most recent as it comes together and falls appear","74":"$5 words the author used in order to convey her point i get annoyed when authors use a lot of overly fancy words to say what they want to say i get that the main character was kind of a pretentious douche and maybe that's what the $5 words were for but it was quite a turn off i also really didn't like the ending or the main character so i'm probably not one of the better people to talk to about this bo this book had potential so much potential unfortunately i got lost in looking up all the $5 words the author used in order to convey her point i get annoyed when authors use a lot of overly fancy words to say what they want to say i get that the main character was kind of a pretentious douche and maybe that's what the $5 words were for but it was quite a turn off i also really didn't like the ending or the main character so i'm probably not one of the better people to talk to about this book","75":" this should really be a 3 5 star ranking or actually possibly even a 4 or 5 but good lord i could not deal with being in nathaniel p 's head for a minute longer the book is so smart about the ways ladies and dudes in their 20s sabotage relationships i saw me and or my friends in page after page which yes made me squirm uncomfortably and be extremely happy that i am a bit out of this phase of life the revelation nate has at the end view spoiler that possibly he actually doesn't desire the sort of women who challenge him the sort of women he has told himself he desires was incredibly insightful along the way hannah has this revelation too although she's forced to it by nate's insensitivity hide spoiler adele waldman has done an excellent job of recreating in writing the sort of person i want to spend absolutely zero hours of my life with","76":"i've never read a novel where i so throughly hated the protagonist nate is a self centered self absorbed sob the author's talent kept me reading page after page and her insight into how the male mind and ego may work was fascinating this brilliant first novel rocked my sensibilities as a woman some readers by be slightly put off as i was by the pretensions and elitist attitudes of nate's group of friends beyond the reality that people do live and inhabit these kinds of lives and beyond my envy of their unlimited life potential i couldn't put down this jewel of a debut novel","77":"$4' section in ibooks i decided why the heck not give it a read well i'll tell you why not the main character one nathaniel p is a pretentious and contradicting asshole while the book itself was indeed well written the only reason for two stars i can't say the same about the story itself a plotless miss at trying to understand the mind of a man nathaniel is disgusting an i've come across this book several times in the past and always admired the cover art after seeing it in the 'under $4' section in ibooks i decided why the heck not give it a read well i'll tell you why not the main character one nathaniel p is a pretentious and contradicting asshole while the book itself was indeed well written the only reason for two stars i can't say the same about the story itself a plotless miss at trying to understand the mind of a man nathaniel is disgusting and the further i read the more i had trouble forcing myself to continue reading what a pig and the ending i mean just a hypocritical self absorbed vain ass wipe","78":"complete waste of time","79":"reminds you first to be afraid because you can never truly understand people nor really speak the language they understand then reassures you that everyone even narcissistic self absorbed infantile mean jerks find love eventually excellent read","80":"three and a half i really enjoyed this although it is a little dense and probably only appealing to about six people reminded me a bit of the show girls with a dash of annie hall thrown in i'm definitely interested to see what she writes next","81":"alfie in the 21st century","82":"too many unnecessaries pages in a book that we could easily conclude in the first chapter nate is a selfish self absorbed boring moron as a positive note loved the cape and tittle of the book","83":"hated every character in this book and i hope that's the point i get it but it was exhausting and i just wanted it to be over from the beginning","84":"it was pointless elitist drivel it was like watching the bachelor with smart pretentious douchebags if i wanted to hear boring dating stories and the over analyzed relationship crap i would talk to a room filled with high school girls thanks for wasting my time","85":"an engaging slightly harrowing read the main character is a type that ladies who've read a book or two and dated a guy or two will recognize the kind of rat in sheep's clothing who can talk to you about bell hooks while rating your cultural correctness on a one to ten scale the book includes a lot of elaborate internal rationalization that almost allows the character to convince himself he's not a total asshole the female characters including a skeptical smart friend and a girlfriend who inspires some uncomfortable insights about what the main character values in women it's patriarchy 101 offer experience to the contrary i found the ending to be rushed and pretty pat but for the most part this book had me laughing and cringing with lots of well wrought metaphors and small lovely details like the nod to lermontov i hope i never meet this dude again but i enjoyed spending a day or two with him in spite of myself","86":"very good writing and strong character sketches but the main character is a jerk who shows no change over time i couldn't have read another word about this guy","87":" ultimately this is an enjoyable if not particularly groundbreaking or mind expanding novel reading it felt like watching a few especially well written episodes of girls but from a male character's point of view the main character nathaniel p is impressively real woman writing a male's inner voice as are the female archetypes he dates if not necessarily his male friends they're inconsequential though ultimately it's a quick and fun read that will resonate for most coastal overly well educated readers the only downside is that the core of the book a relationship between nathaniel p and a smart independent woman hannah drags and grates bringing the book into similarly repetitive circles in the middle section","88":"a quick read but rather middle of the road not much plot insufferable protagonist","89":"this is an enjoyable quick read a perfect summer beach book but definitely not trash as it's well written full of great insights and peppered with fun philosophical arguments waldman does a good job of taking on the male voice i assume she did some research her nate is interesting infuriating kind and sometimes cruel but never depicted without sympathy if like me you spent your 20's single and living in a city you will definitely relate to this book","90":"droning on and on about his first world problems and inability to 'commit' the protaganist bored me vapid and self involved i kept reading it because i hoped it would get better and he'd meet less despicable people nope","91":"boring book couldn't finish it","92":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found this was a very interesting read not a lot happened in the story but i was mesmerized by the writing i found myself disliking nate as the story progressed and couldn't help but feel that by the end of the book he had settled for someone that he could be cruel to without repercussion i think everyone has their own challenges and it was interesting to see someone's from their own perspective without them understanding their own issues","93":"i didn't think i woul have enjoyed the book as much as i did only because i had no knowledge of it whatsoever the cover pulled me in and the backing is what intrigued me all reviews mentioned the modern day dating story a male's perspective it was an enlightening read and waldman nailed it exactly although there were some parts of the book that really question why she wrote her women characters the way she did she wrote nate perfectly a charismatic writer and mingling in the editorial and publishing industry while he has had past relationship experience nate finds himself attracted to a woman of intellect also working in the publishing industry as they begin to date nate finds himself unhappy after 5 6 months into their relationship the reason he doesn't know why but he knows he's unhappy after he breaks up with hannah he begins to date another woman greer who is not intellectually stimulating but keeps him happy this is the part where waldman gets it perfectly because this happens so often in the modern dating life where things ends and there is no definite reason besides being unhappy and you cannot figure out why goes for both men and women but often in men such a great book and deserves being a national best seller","94":" this book was frustrating in its prose redundant in its imagery and it felt like the omniscient narrator turned on nate when it should have been the reader's job to decide where to fall it's also a hell of a good description of the mental machinations of a self interested and insecure man trying to act like a good guy and present himself as the liberal ideal among an urban intellectual elite in reading reviews and looking at reader comments it's increasingly clear why the critics like it and the general public isn't so enthused as a gentrifying yupster like most of the critics the book was familiar and sometimes painfully so for someone who hasn't tried to figure out their place in an environment like that brooklyn and its cast of characters probably seem fake pretentious and unlikable i thought it was a perceptive and usefully uncomfortable read","95":"waldman writes the book from her male main character's pov it seems that she really got his voice but i found him to be unlikeable this made me want to finish the book rather than savor it it's a certain generation a certain crowd and not something that completely appealed to me found the book on kate hudson's instagram and was intrigued when my 25 y o daughter saw that i was reading it she said she hated the ending me not so much it was par for the course probably would have given the book 2 stars but given the writing it definitely deserves an extra just not my cup of tea","96":" see my full review here http booksaremyfavouriteandbest wor \"i feel like you want to think what you're feeling is really deep like some seriously profound existential shit but to me it looks like the most tired average thing in the world the guy who is interested in a woman until the very moment when it dawns on him that he has her wanting only what you can't have the affliction of shallow morons everywhere \"this quote - from toward the end of adelle waldman's debut novel the love affairs of nathaniel p - sums the book up perfectly well almost it skews the judgement toward male behaviour which is certainly the intention of the author however i felt waldman's careful dissection of relationships - building and destroying them - is as equally telling about women as it is about men it just so happens that waldman's main character is male - nathaniel nate piven and nate is a bit of a knob other words such as self absorbed and jerk also spring to mind thankfully liking a character is not a prerequisite for enjoying a book the story is simple - nate is a rising star in brooklyn's literary scene he's done his time as a struggling author and is on the cusp of greater things despite his successes - a book deal an attractive girlfriend - at heart nate is still the small town jewish boy who will never quite have the polish that he'd like \"nate had been the captain of his high school trivia team he knew many things - for example the capital of every african country as well as each nation's colonial name which he could reel off alphabetically - but he did not know the kind of things that make a person knowing at harvard in the fall of 1995 \"the story spans a year or so in nate's life and examines his relationships with various women the women are familiar - kristen his first girlfriend elisa his sophisticated but needy ex girlfriend hannah the attractive and smart hipster greer melodramatic and attention seeking and aurit the 'we're just friends' friend who stands on the sidelines of the nate show passing judgement \"over time nate began to grow frustrated by kristen's lack of literary sensibility the sheer practicality of her intelligence as well as a certain rectitude or squareness on her part - in other words by her essential kristen ness... he started to notice there were women who dressed differently who wore neat looking glasses and sexy high heeled boots and had cool hair that made kristen's ponytail seem uninspired \"waldman has done a sensational job - i pretty much knew what was going to happen from the outset because the dialogue characters and particularly the breaking up scenes were so realistic they felt oddly familiar but 'knowing' nate and predicting how the story would unfold did not diminish my enjoyment - waldman's humour is wry and perfectly paced and nate's voice as the narrator is brilliantly balanced between moments of self importance and self doubt keeping the reader just a touch on his side \"certainly abstract ideas hadn't prevented him from enjoying many other things he found philosophically objectionable such as consumer goods from china jet travel tori amos \"there are some meaty themes in this book particularly around power in relationships and the fact that this objectionable character that you might also sort of like was written by a woman and while i was considering who was to blame in nate's botched relationships i struck a scene at the end of the book that had me thinking nate's friend jason who is much like nate although nate thinks of himself as morally superior says this \"as a rule men want a reason to end a relationship while women want a reason to keep it going... that's why after the fact men look to all the things that were wrong with the relationship to confirm the rightness of ending it women on the other hand go back and search for what might have been different what might have made it work \"true my experience says yes depending on the power play 3 5 5 did i enjoy this book because the plot was so familiar or was that in fact the disappointing aspect of the story would i have been more satisfied with an alternative fate for better or worse for nate perhaps either way waldman writes with style and i'll look forward to her next book i received my copy of the love affairs of nathaniel p from the publisher henry holt and co via netgalley in exchange for an honest review","97":"reading this novel was sort of like sitting through a somewhat awkward coffee date with a friend in which she details everything wrong with her current relationship and you wonder silently why she is with him you still have a nice time though there's coffee there's gossip but when you leave you find yourself unsettled somehow","98":" i have been looking for a book from the male perspective written by a woman for sometime we have all read madame bovary tess of the d'urbervilles and anna karenina all great books with a believable female character this book is a start i really did begin to believe i was getting the secret internal thoughts of men i had to keep reminding myself this was not martin amis writing kudos to adelle waldman for writing such a believable character we have all dated a nathaniel p and yet his inner workings or reasonings always seemed so unintelligible waldman is able to explain why he's is just not that into you at moments cringe worthy and at moments hilarious i really loved this book at the end of the book you will feel like you too had an intimate relationship with nathaniel","99":"i love the vocabulary in this book it isn't condescending or overly intellectual just appropriate for an intelligent audience the main character nate is annoying and self obsessed but that helps me understand him better definitely a great book if you want to read about how stupid and absorbed men can be","100":"i really don't know what i thought about this thoroughly dislikable main character made it incredibly hard to get into this book and care about the outcome ah well another book read i suppose","101":"the august 2014 selection for the mostly new york book club an excellent read this one definitely deserves all the best book awards it has received the forty sixth book i have finished this year would hemingway have ended up killing himself if he had not left hadley will nate end up killing himself i do not know i am happy and grateful to have been married to the same incredible woman for 45 years this september to nate's however limited credit he does figure out the primary reason not to cheat on p 193 it destroys the intimacy in a relationship","102":" as a comedy of manners this book is great weldman has such a command of language a wonderful sense for when to shift the dynamic of a scene with a single short line the accuracy of this book however troubles me leaves me sad that people like nate may and probably do exist though by no means a terrible person his behavior towards other people is despicable the description of this book as a comedy of manners in a generation without any manners at all seems perfectly fitting but this book scares me into thinking some in my generation may be wandering missing not only their manners but their souls","103":" i had to read this book in one day because it was due back to the library and on hold for someone else but it was fun to be immersed in it for that day nate is illuminated in this portrayal as is a certain world brooklyn cool hip literary people some of whom graduated from harvard i loved the way that waldman writes it felt like listening to the people from slate talk on a gabfest but i also found some of the behaviors not just nate's but also his friends kind of too much these people are smart interesting and totally full of themselves i appreciate the intention of making sense of why relationships work or don't from a man's not a very good man's perspective but i also felt like i'd spent all day hanging out with a friend who is kind of self centered and always rehashing why this or that relationship didn't work without any more than a vague sense of responsibility","104":"a bit self indulgent high brow and pedantic yet it needs to grow on you defers misogynism as much as a feminist frazzle to romantic dysfunction and bequeaths a kind of cushion to masculine fumblings guess what this was written by a female so i think gender bias is absolutely out of the window i suppose this is the kind of a book that warrants a reread personally of course","105":"this book was so spot on hence the stars but it really pissed me off","106":" while i'm normally a fan of atypical love stories i'm not sure if this one did it for me in many ways it was right on par with the dissolution of nate and hannah's relationship and i could see a lot of myself in hannah's behaviour what i didn't like was the starkness with which nate picked on hannah's appearance albeit in his head mostly because it made me feel uncomfortable that a man could be so picky also the intellectual discussions between characters seemed a little self indulgent and pretentious altogether though i quite enjoyed the writing","107":"waldman is a first rate writer when she's directly addressing sex fucking and desire the rest is just hip brooklyn literary crowd bull shit that we're led to believe elevates the essential worthlessness of her characters to something interesting a cheap trick i'll still be looking forward to her next book","108":"all's i can say is that i hope waldman took her inspiration for nate from a number of various sources rather than from her own experience because he would be a lot to put up with all in one person i particularly enjoyed the way she captured a certain time in a certain place that i happen to be quite familiar with","109":"the love affairs of nathaniel p or relationships are canoes... originally published on http thegodsmark tumblr com sounds familiar been there samesies my thoughts exactly whoa totally how many times in just the first few chapters did these sentiments flash inside the brain pan at least five then why if my goal for the year was get attain some other perspective was i even reading this book if i had wanted to experience nate's feelings or lack thereof i could just as easily have picked up one of the many journals that chronicle the misadventures of my life except my journals weren't written by a female except when i was trying to be creative this book was however nate is convinced he successfully deceives hannah with passive aggressive band aids and rationalization skittles when in fact he fools only himself waldman proves that in spite of what we men may think many women have no problem articulating our innermost actions thoughts insecurities so guys drop the bullshit--they're on to us the question is are we on to us do we really know what we're doing in the canoe \"'don't worry about it ' she said finally 'it's not a big deal '\"you see relationships are like canoes which i thought was a really novel simile until google revealed some dude had written a book called love is a canoe--goddammit i'm going with it anyway nate spends all his time on shore prodding as many girls as possible with his oar instead of paying attention to the instructor then when he concludes he's ready to embark he convinces a worthy co pilot to set sail except once on the water nate is unsteady rocking the vessel back and forth untrained splashing water on hannah and immature crapping over the side meanwhile hannah is patient guiding and directing nate even accommodating until her well being is compromised yet why is hannah so willing while nate endangers them both waldman hints that women are perpetually aware and ready for what i have deemed the canoe perhaps as chops says this is intrinsic--women are inherently suited for listening observing and caring about canoepersonship while men just want to swing their paddles around actually hannah admits she is uncertain about hopping into a canoe with nate but does anyway so maybe women are more perspicacious about the rewards of a successful canoe trip maybe while men are handling their wood and believing all pleasure derives from their sticks women are looking out at the water imagining what a successful foray feels like because once nate gets dumped back on shore all he wants is to get back out there good for people who enjoy roth but want something a little more pg 13 rated","110":"a quick fun read waldman presents both sides of the rise and fall of one particular brooklyn romance full of cheerful insights along the way","111":" just before the book finishes nate is described by one of his friends as an unreliable narrator an accurate description and if i'm honest it kind of characterised for me the somewhat heavy handed almost clumsy prose style but nevertheless it's true to say that waldman utterly nails her depiction of this awful awful man drawn out through watching his horrific self interest and the way he runs down his relationship with the unfortunate hannah always completely convinced that he's behaving appropriately we're slowly and this gradual discovery is artfully managed made aware of what an appalling man he is whether he's learnt anything at the end is debatable but there's no denying that if the book makes us uncomfortable it's in recognising flashes of our own awfulness in this irredeemable tool a tough one to enjoy then but nevertheless an intriguing if slightly stilted read","112":"everything about this book felt pretentious though i was glad to finally see nate grow up but he was such a douche","113":" the real reason this novel gets four stars is hannah a pretty smart nice and unwaveringly authentic female character who loves and learns and lives the narrator nate pales in comparison to the very thoughtful and well developed hannah and maybe that's the point since the whole text has that tongue in cheek aura of a woman writing from the perspective of a male character waldman's writing is great sometimes poetic but i can't help but wish that we could have skipped all the pretentious and intellectual elitist thoughts and ramblings of nate who decided to deem him literary he's more accurately journalistic to get to the heart of hannah who essentially carries the plot and creates an insightful fascinating story of what it's like to look for love in contemporary new york","114":"plenty of accurate positive reviews such as","115":"oof the misogyny of this one i liked the author's writing style and thought the narrative arc of nate's relationships rang true both the primary relationship and the minor ones described more in passing but nate's overwhelming all encompassing misogyny his view of women as intellectually inferior and emotionally chaotic seemed entirely inconsistent with who this character was over educated brooklyn hipster guys who write for a living and who grew up and rebelled against a traditional immigrant family just don't hold such beliefs in my experience those sexist moments were the times in which it was obvious that a woman wrote this book and was trying to interpret male beliefs in her own biased way all that being said this book's interesting themes and vignettes led to the best book club discussion i can remember so i would highly recommend it as a book club selection","116":"3 5 stars the comments on here frightened me because a lot of people seemed to really dislike this book while on the other hand it has been on a ton of best book lists i was open to it and actually enjoyed most of it there were a couple of times i found reading things from nate's self absorbed and moderately ridiculous point of view to be a bit frustrating but overall it was a good book i don't know that i so much enjoyed the story as i did the writing and character development i really liked the cast of characters and think the writing was solid i'd be interested in seeing different work from this author to gage her storytelling abilities all of that being said i can see why so many people either loved or hated this book","117":"i wanted to like this book and i know a lot of people love it however i was not one of them i did find many aspects of this book to be extremely relatable as if waldman was commenting on my personal relationships what i didn't like was the repetitive descriptions of nate's daily life i could do without the long pseudo intellectual party conversations","118":"the is a well written book about wonderful and beautiful woman involved with a self absorbed overly intellectual cultural snob of a writer who yes dear reader went to harvard my problem with the book is that i felt the same way about the book that the fictional women felt about the main character ultimately in that life is too short to waste it here i read it because of good reviews in the usual places a good book club book discuss among yourselves","119":"main character is wishy washy and you wonder how any of the women ever liked him i kept waiting for something to happen but the book just drones on about why he thinks he deserves better and the relationships weren't even fascinating","120":"the tale of a character called nathaniel p also my brother's name who lives in brooklyn and isn't great with people it's like a romance novel but realistic","121":"blech the second book i've read in as many weeks that has made me want to strangle the main character nate's self centered mysogynistic take on women is reductive and insulting to every smart young woman living in brooklyn one can only hope that adelle waldman meant this as an example of the kind of man we should all avoid","122":"i keep thinking i'm so glad to be married","123":"3 5 stars if i could do it i'm not sure how this book works but it did for me fun read the people felt familiar more emotionally nuanced than i expected but stays within the boundaries it sets for itself doesn't try to make a bunch of grand gestures however i need a serious break from novels that take place in new york man nyc really loves nyc","124":"brilliant like exploring the map of the emotional genome of that guy who seemed so great at first and things fell apart and you couldn't track the path of disaster wonderfully middlemarchie","125":"you don't have to like the protagonist to like a book","126":"well i hate men this was such an accurate depiction of what some men think like it's almost too much to bear and for that i say bravo however what makes me think this is a 3 star book is the fact that she sums up nate's story we as the reader or privy to trying not to spoil the ending in 20 pages all of a sudden he's acquiescing and changing his tune because he is no longer threatened by the woman he is with it's infuriating and so many men do this men to men included all men this man is definitely going to think a little harder before he opens his mouth the next time to anyone but in the end say what you need to say otherwise you just end up unhappy and resentful","127":"gets right inside the head of protaganist nate an upper middle class new york author observing modern manners around relationships with fine detail","128":"so smart and contemporary loved every word of it","129":" this book came highly recommended so part of the reason for my rating may be that for me it didn't live up to its hype the writing is good details are noted that help the reader feel you are there however the story feels padded did we really need to spend the bulk of the book on the hannah relationship which lasts six moths when the the next affair that will last a year gets handled in barely 30 pages one thing the book does is highlight how relationships work relatively quickly there is sex which is often followed by a feeling by one or both parities that a relationship has started yet the couple barely know each other what follows is an extended period of sex and getting to know each other which often reveals that the couple is not compatible and so the two move on for someone seeking a true long term commitment perhaps a woman who does not want to be great grandma age when she has her kids such couplings might feel like time wasting interludes something else about nate and his affairs the last two women like himself do not have regular jobs they need to report to each morning such a life style seems to make it easier for them all to spend time with relationship drama but what of the many who do not have such job freedom how can they play this game also the book illustrates for me why happiness can be such a tough thing for most people to grasp there is what makes you happy deep down in your true self and then there is what looks to others as happiness there can be real pain when what might make you happy does not look attractive to others or conflicts with some social tradition etc","130":"the problem i had with this book is that i couldn't find the point to it the main character wasn't charming or likable or kind which made it extremely difficult to care about what happened to him the one character i did like was hannah but i felt like the emails at the end made her irrational and petty and that ruined her for me if the point of this book was to give me a glimpse into the male perspective on relationships thank god i'm single","131":"i don't think that this book quite lived up to the hype it earned i assume that the hype was generated by brooklyn literary people who couldn't help loving a book that seemed like their lives but i think that nate was a very human character i felt like i was really in his head and understood if i didn't like him i think nate is the rare character who can carry a book without being that interesting a lot of people seemed to hate him i felt more meh","132":"waldman writes believable characters that are both sympathetic and frustrating in dating situations that are painfully relatable satisfying read for someone on the dating circuit","133":"reading this book from the viewpoint of the titular nathaniel p makes me think the author did some lengthy interviews with men in new york in their 20s it must have been torture because i recognize nathaniel in many men i've known and met in passing when i lived in new york in my 20s and she gets them spot on she delves even deeper than i thought possible and sometimes that recognition made me shudder in my own memories especially that specific angle of men who believe they are not sexist and yet treat women as utterly below themselves and don't have enough self reflection to see it nathaniel p tries he really does but he's still terrible and awful and i rolled my eyes so many times while reading this there's a slew of unlikable but recognizable characters and yes some of the women reminded me of myself then also worth many shudders a fascinating book though i'm not sure how i'd feel about it i hadn't lived in new york at a certain time perhaps exactly the same but i can't know","134":"terrible i kept waiting for something to happen this book did zilch for me","135":"fast read about a totally unlikeable brooklyn dude and his love life","136":" i read a review that said that you may not enjoy this book if you weren't part of the williamsburg literary milieu i'm far removed from that world and i really enjoyed this book if you're in your 20s or 30s and you've been on a date you will find something you can relate to in this book nathaniel p is repulsive and this book particularly the chapter that details the state of his apartment is very effective at turning you off of men at the same time nathaniel p is not an atypical monster i have guy friends who have done worse i'm a girl but i really thought adelle waldman did a great job writing from a guy's pov if someone told me that this book were written by a bearded hipster with women issues i would believe them","137":"this was a little different from my usual but i enjoyed it the protagonist was kind of a jerk but he was supposed to be the language is lovely sharp intelligent an interesting look at a man's perspective on relationships","138":" man i was surprised by how much i liked this one i very nearly gave it five stars this is just a really well observed portrait of yuppie dating in literary brooklyn nothing more if neither of those things sound appealing and if you're not ok with flawed protagonists who make incredibly intelligent observations and then do inexplicable frustrating self defeating things all within the span of just a few pages then you won't like this book but if like me you believe that dating is such an interesting human interaction that there probably hasn't been enough written about it then you may enjoy this book there's no question that nathaniel p is a pretentious blowhard the kind of guy i'd meet at a cocktail party and slowly back away from after five minutes of painful conversation about organic kale and obscure german philosophers but really i just felt sorry for him and the immature way he handles relationships some of us have been in situations in which we start dating someone for the wrong reasons and find ourselves staying in it a little longer than we should because of sheer inertia but to habitually still be doing this at age 30 especially when you're otherwise so brutally intelligent in your life is just sad i can't give this five stars because the ending seems a little rushed like waldman was tying to cram a whole other relationship into 12 pages but this is a good fast read that will seem a little too familiar to anyone who's participated in the darwinian meat grinder that is big city dating","139":" adelle waldman's debut novel will no doubt divide people the lead character is not particularly sympathetic and there isn't really much plot to it man in early '30s looks for love finds it discovers that love's not really all it's cracked up to be however it is a wonderfully written character study and there's something irresistible about waldman's prose that keeps you turning the page the love life of a brooklyn intellectual who works in publishing may not appeal to everyone but waldman successfully plants us in nathaniel's world in a way it's a male counterpart to lena dunham's girls although obviously written by a woman and if you enjoy that particular hbo television show you'll lap this up","140":"this book made me so glad to be marrying a woman","141":" a literary riff on the same beat that portlandia hits waldman celebrates condemns her own intended audience of liberal leaning creature of privilege hipsters and though it is certainly critical of that demographic it carries an awareness of doing and being so not with an ironic detachment but an embrace of all the good introspective and the obnoxious overly introspective of the artistically inclined brooklynites pedaling around williamsburg however the true achievement of the novel is not the further documentation of the exhaustively documented post adolescent new yorker but in how real the protagonist the eponymous nathan feels this is a trip into the male psyche by an outsider to the pervasive and often perverse power of the penis and it is utterly believable nathan is a lived in character grappling with a familiar issue \"what the hell am i doing with my love life \" that resolves in an organic if not particularly redeeming denouement ideal reading setting location a coffeeshop in a neighborhood en media gentrifica tables and chairs fashioned from scrap material from hurricane sandy baristas bespectacled and betatted and conversant in coffee tea and dostoevsky music tori amos' \"strange little girls\" album a feminist conversion of songs with essential male perspectives highlight tracks joe jackson's \"real men\" a reflection on the damage wrought by boys trying to become men slayer's \"raining blood\" becomes a paean to eve judith and the blame foisted on women by the patriarchs or something i may have incepted a little too deep there and also i've decided that \"incepted\" is a viable adverb food anything local sustainable and delicious in proportion to its pretension","142":"yasminjaunbocus wordpress com","143":" oh man i had such a rollercoaster while reading this book there were moments where i really enjoyed it when i felt to be guided through a truly deep observance of the characters' lives however for the most part i did not feel that waldman was going slowly or patiently enough to really create nate in a complete way for me it gets weighed down by its effort to catalog only his romantic life and specific chapter of his romantic life at that all said i really enjoyed the ending that was certainly one of the narration's high points","144":" after reading several wonderful reviews of waldman's writing i was disappointed by this book in fact i gave up on it the characters are compelling and waldman writes a decent plot but there's a crassness to this book that was unsettling don't get me wrong i have no problem reading books that include profanity and harsh realities but harsh language should serve a purpose all language for that matter should serve a purpose waldman seemed to be employing coarse language and sexual references just for the sake of doing it not because it fit the voice of the piece not because the narrative needed it just for the sake of crassness","145":" when i was 36 i found myself single and back in the dating world for the first time since the age of 18 and i found that the dating world was much the same as i'd left it that is to say the same head fuckery as in high school though the men had learned to dress better read more widely and do more interesting extra curricular activities also to fuck better for the most part i had a friend whose mother was recently divorced in her 60s she told me her mother was saying the same thing the dating scene was very high school the men presumably had their complaints too but who knows what they really thought now we have a really good guess i'm pretty sure i dated this nathaniel p somewhere in my 30s and probably even his more detestable friend jason too i'm not proud of it all i can say in my defense is that it didn't last any longer than it took for hannah to get her head clear around 5 months and to be fair the signals coming from them as from nate p were mixed and largely indecipherable also in my case i'd been married for ages and i had no idea what was out there my attempts to communicate directly without any head fucking were met not with relief from the guys but as a sign of weakness oh here's a nice tender floozie fresh off the boat i'm surprised how many people have said they didn't like the characters in this book why not i found that even nate as hypocritical irrational and blind to his worst faults even as he was self critical in so many other ways wasn't all that terrible i was grateful to get this kind of insight into a type we know so well and yet don't know well enough have longed to know better have stayed up late journaling about wondering wtf a couple of people i know said this book made them hate their husbands a little even though they loved their husbands they didn't think their husbands were quite like this but some lines from a poem of mine about my own husband i fear there is something in maleness that can't help but compartmentalize that is always ready to congratulate itself a thing in you that i cannot love you read this book and then you look over at that handsome dark head on the pillow and you think hm you seem nice now but what about those earlier incarnations of you perhaps before i ever met you were you ever like this nate guy did you ever think like this we've been together 13 years and still sometimes names surface names of women i've never heard of oh he says she wasn't important someone he dated say five months maybe her heart was broken like this hannah's was though maybe she spent years trying to figure out what happened maybe she could have written a novel about it had she been a writer or my first husband the way he would say eww i wish she didn't take her sweater off just now she's so anorexic she looks like a concentration camp survivor then who did he date right after we broke up someone even skinnier turns out he was attracted to that look all along and going out of his way to lie about it i hadn't even asked he was the one who brought it up all this and more explained in this book it's not like women aren't constantly evaluating men this one doesn't have the kind of hands we like or the eyes but he has a nice way of moving he's smart and funny that one is successful the one we marry might not even be that great a lover and talk about not being able to communicate about what we like in bed nate who prides himself on being so reasonable and rational and a direct communicator totally flees any outright expression about anything including a direct request about what he'd like in a blowjob we're not too good at that either are we how do you tell a 45 year old man that what he's probably been doing all his life doesn't work too well and therefore has failed pretty much everyone he's ever been with usually you don't nate is sometimes embarrassed by what this or that woman does or says maybe greer blurts out a comment without thinking it through and sounds kind of dumb among his uber intellectual friends oh so cry me a river how many women have just wanted to crawl into hole and die for every single simpson's quote every football replay i was at a party full of english professors not long ago and some guy cracked the stupidest joke and all the other guys laughed and i said i can't believe you guys did that at other parties around boulder maybe but i thought you were supposed to be smart and one of the guys said and if he repeats himself because we laughed we'll laugh again and have fun doing it too and meanwhile the women are all dying of embarrassment and apparently nate p is too i didn't hold a lot of what went on nate p's head against him i didn't mind totally that he didn't want to put a relationship first i'm at a different stage of life now and as a woman entering menopause i found i could sympathize with a man who wanted his career to come first but wanted some way to get non casual sex also i wish we could figure out a different social organization because this insistence on nuclear families and the merging of the different male female timelines is really stupid and there's a lot of unnecessary loneliness and horniness and consequent distraction because of it what was grating in nate was the entitlement the way he held other people's sense of entitlement against them while going on feeling entitled elisa couldn't be entitled for example to a nice apartment with tasteful fixtures a sign in his mind of her spoiled outlook her constant complaining but he could be entitled to look upon her lovely face without its being spoiled by any acne or sign of tiredness the idea which although he wasn't born to this he had never been handsome or wealthy in youth that as a successful man he was entitled to a beautiful woman this does seem to be embedded in american culture and somehow it has weaseled its way into nate's thinking without him ever even fully questioning it he questions it in his friends because they are clearly worse than he is but he doesn't totally question it in himself i'm not offering this as a criticism of the book i think a lot probably most men are this way as i said i think it's embedded in our culture i think the book exposes it quite deftly why nate's relationship with hannah fails is not as interesting as why his next one succeeds and if i were to knock pieces of stars off it would be because i thought the last bit of the book was not as well developed throughout the book contains a lot more summary than scene which seems to be what's going on in fiction right now but in this last part i wasn't sure it served as us readers quite as convincingly i could see hannah better than i could see greer my guess and it's just a guess is that he learned from hannah how to be a better person he did find out that maybe he liked loving he became a little more willing to risk because somewhere in there he went from being someone who did not want to be in a relationship to someone who did and there was no real accounting for that change maybe there just is no way to account for it maybe the author is just guessing too this does happen so much the guy who changes for the next woman so of course we're curious about that question almost more than we are about what accounts for the guy in the first place who he is we'd like to know then why he changes perhaps it's just that greer doesn't ask him to change much she's pretty in all the right ways none of the other men is going to have to work hard to see what he sees in her he's not going to have explain her to anyone jason for instance she's already successful so he's not going to have to deal with midwifing her career or any insecurities she might have about his success vs hers but she's insecure in ways that might be charming ways that play to his strengths she's not as independent as hannah is in certain ways and not as needy in others or in ways that he imagines hannah is needy because he confuses her by playing head games she's smart but not in the same ways that he's smart so he can patronize when he wants to and learn from her in ways that don't have to make him feel dumb she's the right blend of status enhancing beautiful and successful without being emasculating complaining like elisa and threatening smart and secure like hannah that's my guess but i'm not totally sure and the novel does come close to saying this i guess it's the telling vs showing thing because it tells and doesn't show i'm not quite as convinced i had fun watching all the young fauna in brooklyn i was wondering how they were all supporting themselves as freelance writers really not long ago there was an essay in n 1 panicking about the cost of living in brooklyn and wondering if all the intellectuals would soon be forced into a diaspora what would happen if they had to live in the provinces whom would they meet would this improve their thinking and writing i hope so though waldman's writing is fine there's nothing too exciting about the thinking she represents as what's going on among these intellectuals the tagline for this book is something about a brilliant book about a brilliant young man i'm with it as far as the brilliant book goes but i assume no one believes nate is brilliant isn't that why so many readers are disliking these characters i mean the commodification of conscience seriously that's in the book to show us how mediocre nate is right and of course hannah engages him in this conversation and challenges him with ideas of her own which also aren't too great i've been living in boulder where wild oats and alfalfa's the precursors of whole foods got their start for 30 years we have so already had that conversation boulder btw does not have a medical school slightly annoying when someone builds their own world so well and then shrugs off the provinces though i think she did take some trouble with her east side and west sides of cleveland like that place matters but back the guy stuff the very ending when he's thinking back to hannah just before he dives deeper into his relationship with greer and he realizes that maybe it could have worked with hannah but oh well it didn't and he has greer he's happy whether or not he deserves to be and he realizes that in time he will no more remember the pleasures and pains he felt with hannah than he will the smell of the morning air from his apartment which he is about to move out of in order to move in with greer oh my god that's just how it is isn't it a friend called me up some years ago her husband was giving a lecture in boulder where he'd once been a visiting a professor she had remained at home in the far gray north you won't believe it she said he has no emotional memory whatsoever he just got off the phone with me he's ecstatic the sunshine the mountains the thin dry air the west he wants us to move back he can't believe how much he loved it there how much he's missed it she said i remembered how much he loved it when we lived there i notice that he doesn't like weather here the dark the attitudes of the northeasterners but he forgets this makes me so sad i have a male friend who had been in a tempestuous relationship he came to see me after they broke up told me all about it all about her she was beautiful she was complicated fascinating then he traveled around the world for a year he sent me a letter went round to see jenny i thought she'd be this hippie a bit brown drab somewhat whiney but no she's lovely quite beautiful actually very funny it was something to see her again and i thought i could have told you that i remembered she was lovely funny intriguing etc but he hadn't no emotional memory it's sad because you know that it happens to the guys you once loved too that they're not remembering the things you remember that even when you break their hearts they'll just forget i even see it with my son while looking at colleges he would fall in love with a place express such longing articulate such an eloquent reason why a certain school hit him a particular way and then six months later not even apply there whereas if that were me i'd feel some kind of loyalty to whatever that thing was that i'd try to say even if i should have let it go i'd apply and maybe i'd go there even if a better school had come along not saying that's better not saying they're all like that or that they can't remember once they see you again or once they return to the place etc but jeez what waldman's done here is render this guy in a light that makes him seem not entirely unreasonable neurotic conflicted selfish at times or self centered but given the culture certainly not as bad as some and you do get insight and if you accept that career might come first and be satisfying for some people and yet sex is an imperative while casual sex is off putting for several reasons you can see that people like nate p might in fact be in a predicament when in order to get non casual sex they need to go among women for whom it seems relationship is at least as important as a career and they are always breaking rules and being seen as assholes for not sharing this emphasis i don't think a bad place for a person to start what's wrong is what he feels entitled to in a man who he thinks he is how great he thinks he is how rational he thinks he is how poorly he communicates and a host of other things in general this is a huge beef women have with men the unfair charges that we are the irrational ones the manipulative ones the indirect communicators it also is unfair of women to put their own emphasis on their careers and then say wait i want a kid where's the guy if you wait too long all you get are the leftovers and haven't they shown by their lives that they don't care about family if relationship matters to you as a woman you'll live like the character kristen does weaving a well chosen man into her career early on ps because i hate it when reviewers never mention other books that have attempted similar things i did want to say that while many have compared this novel to other comedies of manners like austen's works i thought of the much more recent philosophical musings in how should a person be by sheila heti in that book too you had a lot of artistic and intellectual types with no visible means of support trying to figure out not just who to be but how to be but also there's reproduction is the flaw of love but lauren grodstein which also happens to be set in brooklyn and which also makes a decent pass at getting in a young man's head a younger man's head but still and there's a similar issue of if only we didn't have to deal with this reproduction thing overall i felt grodstein's book was far less successful just less deep somehow but it was good at the guy head thing and i liked grodstein's a friend of the family which is why i had gone back to her earlier book anyhow just wanted to mention that there has been another attempt at this if not as successful","146":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here interesting portrait of love lives of our generation and that in the end smartly manages you to pity the main character nat whom you have followed through all his thoughts","147":"pretentious pricks talking to each other about stuff and thinking too hard about life some passages were spot on eerily so i kind of hate everyone in this book because i am sort of like them very confusing","148":"before i say anything about this book itself i want to address how it has been portrayed in the media when this novel first came out i seem to recall that a lot of the coverage proclaimed that its title character nate was some kind of representative of straight males as a group even the back cover of my paperback maintains that nate is an emblem of our time this is a terrible terrible thing to saddle a novel with it can't lead to anything but women reading the book and being horrified that this is how all men think and men reading the book and growing incensed at the implication that this character represents them anger at the novel and its author ensues with none of it having anything to do with the actual writing the actual novel please do not read this book thinking nate represents anyone but himself or i don't see how you can avoid hating it nate is certainly an interesting character a douchebag to be sure but not only a douchebag you can see how he sometimes works hard to be a better person you will probably find yourself relating to him in some ways even agreeing with him at some points i did he overthinks everything which could've been tedious but instead is somehow entertaining i think adelle waldman did an impressive job of making nate both complex and consistent are all men like nate of course not and i don't think waldman intended to make that statement but i will say there were a couple of astute observations in here that jibed pretty well with my own experiences with men and it was kind of a relief to see them in print some interesting things are being said about the way men and women interact with each other so was the book entertaining somehow yes every time i had to put it down i couldn't wait to get back to it nate's brain was a surprisingly enjoyable place to be in spite of it all and the rest of the characters were very very well drawn we see them all through nate's eyes but are somehow able to form our own opinions of them as well another impressive feat waldman is able to pull off the interactions between the characters never fail to be interesting and there's definitely some humor if you're open to it i will admit that by the last twenty pages or so i found nate so loathesome that i couldn't wait to be done but then waldman capped the whole thing off with an absolutely perfect ending reading zeitgeisty books is always a risk see how should a person be or better yet don't but i am very very glad i gave this one a chance i fervently hope adelle waldman's next book doesn't feature any characters like nate but i will be eager to see what she comes up with","149":"3 5 ish i ended up being engaged enough to finish almost more to get to 35 books than to see where the story led","150":" maybe i'm too old for this book maybe it's intended for a younger hipper audience i used to live in brooklyn and thought i'd enjoy this novel about a 30 something guy and his dating habits but he's totally self absorbed he gets an intellectual email from a woman he met at a friend's party the night before and he sits back in his desk chair wearing only grey underwear and imagines here giving him a blow job i quit at page 42 disgusting i don't want to read about losers like this guy and i wish they didn't exist","151":"i had such high expectations for this book and i was super disappointed i felt the plot was way too jumpy and didn't seem to sync at any point in the book sadly there wasn't one character i seemed to like again super disappointing midway thru the book i couldn't wait for it to be over","152":"i don't know if the main character was unlikeable on purpose or not but he was incredibly grating and the book was full of men are so logical women are so emotional and illogical crap again maybe that was supposed to just be illustrative of the way the main character thinks but given that his attitude didn't change throughout the book it seems irrelevant","153":" like a never ending episode of girls told from the male perspective waldman's writing is impressive introspective u0026amp intricately wrought in a way that your typical chick lit novel isn't however i would argue that it isn't nearly as engaging as a typical chick lit novel jennifer weiner anyone you will feel like you've accomplished reading something intellectual but you may not really care by the end of it i felt glad to be out of nate's head u0026amp ready to move on to someone who isn't such a naval gazer","154":"brilliant observations marred by myopia of the true nature of new york literary scene she can see flaws in people but not in the culture which she takes for granted of course everyone spends their free time going to readings yay cosmopolitan writers who don't watch tv in the beautiful and the damned f scott fitzgerald knew when to stop giving wet sloppy kisses to new york and get real waldman doesn't have a clue but she does deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as fitzgerald which is saying a lot","155":" lots of reviews and critiques about this book and the characters as shallow and self absorbed there is some truth they are an intellectual subset of ivy league and literary types who sit around and discuss important things i found the characters not ones i related to as in i don't personally know these people but i thought that they were honest and well developed which is what i look for in a story you are drawn to the stereotypes of them but if you look past that fact that you might personally dislike them they're honest and well done as for nathaniel himself he's a guy he dates people he's not always good to them but if you look back at your relationships you're not always a good person waldman i feel develops him honestly as a guy who is bad at relationships because he hasn't found a relationship that he's good at the story itself revolves around his relationship with hannah the girl that on paper he should be with ultimately he sabotages it and ends up with a someone else above all else it is a well written and engaging character driven story","156":" jesus i cannot believe how critical people are of a this book and b poor nathaniel p on the latter why do women readers expect so much of men one would be much happier in life doing as i do view them as the second sex the lesser than the biologically inferior or better yet simply the less fortunate this perspective lowers the expectations for their behavior and makes life easier for us all i'm only partially serious i think all genders have shared flaws that might be teased into particular character traits all genders have shared imperfections i'm happy that i have mine but i really don't presume them to be better than any other gender or disposition i love how adelle captures nathaniel's so astutely i don't find him despicable i feel sorry for him just as i do every other sentient being my guess is that she was unprepared for how reactive readers would be to what is very likely a fairly normal white man living in brooklyn today in this regard the collective criticism of a book story or character if nothing else reveals the dominant social mindset which is a valuable message a writer or any other social critic","157":"i didn't love it i didn't hate it the protagonist is rather annoying but it still held my interest enough to finish the story but nate left a bad taste in my mouth","158":"waldman is clearly a gifted writer and i think i would have loved this book in my single days but i think it was the wrong time in life to read this i found the characters self absorbed and the protagonist was difficult to like i do credit her though as a female writer for getting inside the male brain and their dating habits","159":"perhaps readers in their 20s and 30s would enjoy this book but i didn't related to the characters or the story and stopped reading after about a third of it since i wasn't enjoying any of it enough to continue","160":" i haven't actually read this book but i'm fairly confident on its contents based on this article the author wrote http www washingtonpost com posteve basically because she's written a book with a male protagonist she believes she can authoritatively speak on what it's like to be a man and feels entitled to make insulting generalizations about them because obviously creating a male character based on your preconceptions and stereotypes proves that all men actually embody those preconceptions and stereotypes actually just the other day i imagined what being a t rex was like it turns out that all they really wanted to do was wear tiny hats and ride around on old fashioned bicycles mystery solved scientists","161":" admittedly i may have had unrealistic expectations for this book given that it was set in the new york literary world early on i found the main character nate to be a superficial pretentious windbag when i wanted to feel intrigued by the machinations of his relationships his friendships felt stilted and the characters seemed to serve such overt purposes to offset nate's personality traits in too obvious ways his 'affairs' didn't make him a more interesting character i nearly gave up on the story but stuck it out it was quite short anyway hoping there would be redemption at the end there wasn't the only redeeming aspects here are the backdrop of the story and the smart writing style overall this feels like a missed opportunity for something really good take a pass on this one","162":" this was a terrible book i tried to appreciate it i really did perhaps the fact that i am far too familiar with nate's world made this book underwhelming to me i found nothing special about it because i live it or at least catch glimpses of this world in my day to day life as a new yorker also i think ms waldman's writing is a bit forced there was nothing seamless in it it's forceful and garish however maybe that's the whole point the world nate lives in is pretentious and oftentimes inauthentic a never ending rat race to impress weigh options win and keep winning nate is stuck in it and he ruins people he encounters in the process maybe i'm just being a bitter single women in nyc regardless ms waldman doesn't give me hope rather she sets a magnifying glass upon the reality of the dating world in nyc","163":" first off the most important things for me when i'm reading a book are an author's prose and characters waldman failed miserably in the former and surpassed all expectations with the latter i'm not saying the woman can't write what i'm saying is she cannot write well or rather she belongs on the pages of glamour cosmo or enter any other magazine aimed towards women who let the media dictate whether their next shoe purchase will include fringe or color blocking she should stick to writing for vogue com that being said she does a brilliant job in writing from a male perspective best i've ever read actually i tip my hat off to her for that people hate and want to beat the sh t out of nate and give the book bad reviews because they hate him but that's kind of the point nate's an asshole if waldman can evoke violent outbursts from her readers she's doing something right now if only her prose didn't make me feel like i was getting paper cuts on all ten digits with the turning of each page in short this book is good for high school girls who only don the latest in michael kors bags","164":" if you like hbo's \"girls \" or just want a tart seriocomic alternative to chick lit \"the love affairs of nathaniel p\" may be your cup of organic fair trade tea nate piven has arrived in his mid 30s at a very solid level of desirability to the women in his brooklyn milieu of writers and artists he and his friends are a few years older than their fictional \"girls\" neighbors and mostly further advanced in their careers four years at harvard solid success as a writer and acceptably good looks have put nate in a position to attract the verbal and pretty women he favors and to start relationships that he will surely tear down each in its turn he doesn't mean to treat anyone badly but doesn't exactly leave joy in his wake a pattern fueling his growing reputation as a jerk a balanced blend of dialogue and backstory laden narrative moves the action the narration is third person and essentially from nate's point of view but packs an awareness that he hasn't achieved or wanted there's no need to read between lines to infer nate's thoughts and motivations they are spelled out as plainly as in a young adult novel although with a more sophisticated vocabulary despite the book's very specific setting with its unique manners and mores anyone who takes an interest in the age old games serial daters play can find \"aha\" moments among the ruins of nate's this review was originally published under this reviewer's byline in the florida times union jacksonville com on february 26 2014","165":"selfishness vanity narcissism these qualities abound in pretentious lit majors of small liberal arts colleges coincidentally they are also the traits of the much despised protagonist of waldman's novel i found this to be an enjoyable read despite having to suffer through nate's fickle self pitying misogynistic inner monologue oh and of course i reveled in the brilliant and witty women calling nate out on his bullshit particularly aurit and hannah waldman presents a subtle and honest social commentary on the anxieties of modern dating and romance i am grateful to have read this book at 20 as i'm sure it will save me the trouble of becoming involved with any more literary fuckboy types like nathaniel p thanks to waldman for this funny and insightful cautionary tale","166":"the love affairs of nathaniel p is the funny story of a young man in the literary world who channels his inner bonehead through his personal relationships with the women who travel in his social circle by the end of the novel it is not clear whether nate has learned a lesson or not nevertheless the narration of his dating and intimacy train wrecks entertains the reader even though the chuckles might be accompanied by cringes","167":"i didn't want to read this book in fact i made a conscious effort to not add it to my to read shelf despite all the hype but then my friend lent it to me and told me it was a quick fascinating read and i had a trip coming up so i read it i finished it in two plane trips and my friend was right it was a quick fascinating fun and engaging book why didn't i want to read it i didn't want to read it because it was about a young male writer living in brooklyn and treating women not so well why would i want to read that it seemed all too close to home but in spite of my doubts what felt familiar actually worked in the book's favor in my opinion nate the aforementioned young brooklyn writer can't seem to find what he wants in a relationship he's dated quite a few women and things haven't always ended in the best way but then he meets hannah and maybe this time it will be different even though the plot isn't all that interesting or novel i found waldman's portrayal of nate pretty interesting it's a book by a woman written from a man's perspective which is entirely convincing at least it was to me she manages to make nate both unlikable and vaguely relateable at the same time his hangups about writing friendships and women are petty and immature but essentially human and compelling waldman's writing is strong and her descriptions of brooklyn and the literary circles nate runs with are spot on","168":"3 5 stars overall this book the story in the book was very good i got annoyed with how many times the book congratulated itself for being so intelligent with such an intelligent protagonist and so many intelligent characters and it was funny to me how the author made the 30 somethings condescend however kindly to the 20 somethings fresh from college i think that this writer when she focuses on story is really very good i will read her next book if when there is one","169":"i really enjoyed this book the writing was fantastic the character development was great i could not fucking stand nate tho i'm pretty sure that's the point i love that the main character is so unlikeable","170":"i thought that the book was pretty well written so not difficult to read but i also wasn't ever really excited to read it i didn't think it had much new to add","171":"we're you in my last relationship adelle waldman brilliant book but can't help feeling a wee bit despondent about the site of my own affairs","172":" nathaniel piven could be considered by some to be quite a catch a well read harvard graduate nate is a good looking writer who recently sold his first book and thinks of himself as a bit of an intellectual raised by immigrant parents to respect intelligence and hard work he wants to be seen as irresistible but he struggles with his self esteem nate has had several long term relationships with women but ultimately he's grown bored or wearies of his girlfriends' idiosyncrasies although it wasn't something he'd admit aloud he often thought women were either deep or reasonable but rarely both when nate meets hannah a fellow writer at his ex girlfriend's dinner party he is charmed by her intellect and her knack for conversation as well as her looks but he is unsure whether he should pursue a relationship with her hannah isn't looking for a serious relationship either but as nate begins to pursue her and she realizes how much she enjoys being with him she finds herself falling for him and nate loves the way hannah can hold her own in arguments and match wits with his pretentious friends as the relationship deepens however nate finds himself falling into the same behavior patterns will he realize what he really wants before it's too late or will he wind up ending another relationship for superficial reasons honestly i know there are many men like nate out there and i'd like to apologize to all women everywhere not only wouldn't i ever want someone i knew to date him i didn't enjoy spending time reading about him i found this book utterly frustrating and even a bit annoying--the marketing of this book leads you to believe nate is going to have some major epiphany but in the end he remains the same callow unrepentant man child he has always been there is so much pretension among the characters in this book except hannah that i couldn't understand why she was even friends with these people let alone interested in pursuing a relationship with nate there are times you read a book and find yourself wondering who cares that was the way i felt while reading the love affairs of nathaniel p while arielle waldman is a very talented writer--she certainly has created a group of utterly unappealing characters--i wish this book had a little more depth to it a little more heart and a little more growth while i'm curious to know what happened to nate after the book ended i hope someday someone was able to smack some sense into him","173":"a navel gazing novel about relationship challenged intellectual you will forget are horrible people because the writing is good","174":"brilliant characterization and pitch perfect dialogue none of the characters is altogether likable but wow waldman captures them expertly as i read the reviews in goodreads i was struck by the number of people who didn't like the novel as i read it i reminded myself that liking the characters is not a requirement for enjoying let alone admiring a novel the best review of this book is the one by ron charles second in the sequence he's the former editor of the washington post book world his review is spot on","175":" this book started off very promising nat is a cultured and intelligent man in spite of his real or alleged shortcomings with women he's undeniably decent and makes an effort to understand his actions and their effects i was interested to see where this modern man goes with his intelligence and sensibilities and who his lovers are and how their love lives develop the novel notwithstanding occasional good writing and highbrow references quickly degenerates into a sorry state almost everyone in this book turns out to be petty and solipsistic their entire lives seem to revolve around how they think they're feeling for their partner and how they think their partner is feeling for them they analyze themselves and second guess their partners like insecure adolescents towards the end when nat and hannah are heading for a breakup their conversations and emails are not just frivolous but grating my favorite character in the novel was aurit one chapter of the book stars with this memorable paragraph like frued aurit had a coherent theory of the universe from a single foundational myth she had derived a large and growing labyrinth of substories all internally logical and surprisingly convincing as long as you accepted her initial premises the most important of these was the belief that being part of a couple was the primary marker of psychological health on such a basis she came up with far reaching analyses of everyone she encountered i just love the type","176":"waldman captures the self involved brooklyn literary guy perfectly a fun if ultimately sad read walk down 5th ave in the slope and you will trip over one of these types on every block","177":"i finished finally but really disliked the main characters","178":" i read this book at the same i was reading arendt's a history of totalitarianism i am still unsure which one i find more disturbing a brutal and hysterical look at the new york dating scene from the perspective of a white male writer waldman's real accomplishment is to both attract and repel with impeccable renderings of brooklyn's literary scene and twentysomething intellectuals i couldn't help but cringe at the subtle critiques of women's bodies from the narrator's perspectives and the acerbic observations of women who keep their self help books hidden away in their bedrooms and their camus and rilke for their living room shelves the sexism is so subtle and finely detailed in this book a terrific read and critique","179":"if you see yourself in the protagonist go read bell hooks now","180":"the author writes from a male point of view about contemporary relationships insightful very heterosexual","181":"there are some interesting thoughts and take always from this book but i could not get over the feeling that the author wanted to prove how smart they were and spoke down to the reader","182":"great book could not put it away though i am not so sure about the end but she does capture male thoughts very good i thought so if you want to find out what goes on in a man's mind that's the book","183":" no i am no longer in my 20's and i don't live in brooklyn but from my perspective adelle waldman has done a superb job of capturing a specific time and place i'm not sure this novel will go down as one of the great novels of our time but i believe it will be viewed as a well written book which encapsulates a particular strata of our culture today nate is a self indulgent entitled protagonist who because he admits to the fact that he is self indulgent and entitled absolves himself of those characteristics he considers himself so self aware that he can justify his behavior toward women especially those he fantasizes about dates or has dated although i hated him he was remarkably well drawn and was fascinating to read about i just hope my daughter doesn't go out with him my criticism of the book was that the middle part where he is ruminating about his relationship with hannah as things start to deteriorate got redundant but i loved the way waldman ended the story","184":"guilty pleasure","185":"ugh i love hate this book so hard but it's so well done i don't want it to be real but it's so real ugh fuck everything","186":"this book seems to be very well written at times it put me in mind of emma by jane austen the evocation of an inner life nate's inner dialogue is probably the bulk of the text in tension with the third person narration but there's nothing at stake here it didn't matter to me if nate matured or found love faux literary clever and for a short novel it kind of drags","187":" while there are flashes of sharp writing and genuine insight here waldman has written a book which is largely self reflexive and ego centric speaking as a member of what i can only assume to be the target audience twenty thirty something brooklyn writer types the portrayal of this world was basically an exercise in self gratification writing is hard dating is hard it's difficult to balance the two it's difficult to be happy i get it but there's nothing new or original or particularly exciting here writing about mediocrity often results in well mediocrity but i'm sure the reviewers enjoyed it this was written for them after all","188":" sigh i have such mixed feelings about this book i want to start out this review by saying that adelle waldman is a talented writer though it feels a bit thesaurus heavy it is hard to tell if this writing style is her own or one that is being used to project a feeling onto the eponymous nathaniel p regardless of this tendency i found her writing style enjoyable and i have a feeling she will far surpass this book in the future now for the book at hand the love affairs of nathaniel p places us inside a pompous hipstery brooklyn transplant who is embarking on the successful stage of his book career nathaniel has a strong taste for the ladies as long as he doesn't get to know them when he does become involved in a relationship he finds himself chronically dissatisfied which is something that i find is a common thread in the new york dating scene i found that a lot of truths were captured in his romantic interactions and that these glimmers of hope were the more entertaining parts of the book i just wish that i ever felt the need to turn the page i'm not sure if it was the topic the writing or the writing about writers situation but i never felt excited to read this book unfortunately overall it all fell a bit flat for me not really going anywhere as far as plot or characterization while i did feel in the end nathaniel got exactly what he was looking for and deserved my guess is a lot of people were frustrated with where the book went i absolutely do not intend to spoil but i will say i found it satisfying either way solid writing and an okay book","189":"run on sentences whole chapters with little dialogue just pages of self indulgent drivel from a self absorbed dick faced main character constant comparisons of the bodies and weaknesses of women he's screwed with and over catcher in the rye like adolescent whining meets alfie with no character redemption at the end at all i do not recommend this book","190":"i listened to this audiobook during my 30 minute commutes to u0026amp from work for a month as i did i tweeted about my reactions to the musings and quotes from the main character nate using the hashtag #microbookreview join my conversation https twitter com brittemorris | @brittemorris i was sorely disappointed because at the book's arc as nate realizes the depth of his feelings for hannah we come to realize he is not a dynamic character our hopes are dashed and his internal conflict thereafter become an incessant and droll monologue as i reflect on the book i realize author adelle waldman foreshadows nate's inability to change for anyone but himself when she describes vertical and horizontal characters horizontal people are obsessed with fitting in and do what others like waldman said through nate's character nate has an inordinate amount of self doubt and reliance on his peer's approval for success in his professional and social life generation yers operate on a currency that is quantified by the amount of confirmation we receive from our peers especially in the digital age rather than connecting on a simple but intimate level nate has disconcertedly high expectations in women his self professed title as an intellectual via his harvard education and forthcoming book bolster his status his situation is revelatory of the disconnect yers exhibit as they propel themselves into art but are inadequate socially and are emotionally unavailable hannah was nate's last vestige of humanness her down to earthness resounded in her opinion of lolita she said i t's snobbery to think you're better if someone doesn't like an elegant tale of molestation she was never swept away by her own wit but instead let it keep her grounded what's frustrating was the untapped potential nate wasted he had endearing qualities such as his habit eat raisin bran as breakfast's main course u0026amp a 'dessert bowl' of lucky charms he's intelligent and fun to be with but his short fuse and disconnect from society make it impossible to commit i was disheartened by the conclusion of the book because although the character development was good there was no trackable change in the novel's direction i think i am more perturbed though by the innumerable traits i share with nate's character in the dating arena","191":"an excerpt from http iknowwhatyoushouldread wordpre the love affairs of nathaniel p is a look at relationships generally why we like who we like why we sometimes end up with people who aren't the best match for us how early excitement can turn quickly into boring routine how things that aren't all that annoying annoy us how our friends' opinions matter how when you stop trying it all falls apart through the lens of nate's relationships specifically rating 4 5","192":" does what is says on the tin the narration of nate's love affairs a male point of view but only a woman could have written something to utterly devoted to love affairs i honestly doubt a male writer would write anything remotely similar it's not necessarily bad as i'm really into relationship themed books hey i'm a woman did i learn something from this book or was it just a waste of my time i learnt that nate was an arsehole that never knew what he wanted with no great talents besides being a bit intellectual and having written a book and yet he had a string of women queuing up to be his partner makes you depressed to think about it as one female friend of nate pointed out relationships are always welcome by women they always come at the right moment so when men decide that it might be the right time for them there's always someone willing to take that chance with them this is really the moral lesson of this book the female characters are in general more interesting you start rooting for nate's relationship with the deep hannah but you end up wanting nate to be as far away from precious hannah as possible","193":"i'm surprised i finished this one it was exhaustingly boring you may agree if you tend to prefer books with an ending or a middle or a particular beginning","194":"this book was painful to read because i disliked the main character sooooo much and i wanted to smack him the whole time was that the point or am i supposed to understand and empathize with him","195":"i had high hopes for this book after reading a positive review waldman's writing is incredible and the novel has some virtues but i grew to hate nate's character more and more as i went on","196":"i was not excited my book club picked this book seemed like an over told subject of dating life in new york i could not have been more pleasantly surprised this was a very quick read for me in just two days the dialog was fast with excellent character development without being long winded thinking about how men think or don't think as the case may be was very reassuring for me i think we all take ourselves to seriously definitely recommend","197":"i don't get the negative reviews witty funny good and real story nate is a jerk but the book is about boredom and finding meaning in intellectual world not being your parents and fighting it through the eyes of his relationship any person with success and any intellectual thought has gone through these feelings in dealing with significant others man or woman","198":" i have to admit i almost quit reading this book because nathaniel p made me so angry but i persevered and i'm glad i did it's a good 'way we live now' book about brooklyn writers ambition dating and over educated over confident ivy league men or it could be argued their under confident intellectual female counterparts i wonder though if nathaniel p was a woman if this would be considered 'chic lit ' i think probably not since there's some lovely writing and psychological insights all the more impressive since waldman gets in the head of nathaniel the man","199":"sort of annoying and stupid but i guess fun interesting","200":" whole foods romance this book is hard to argue with i suddenly want to i want to treat it counter intuitively critique it for being elitist yell about how cleverly it tricks you into thinking it has universal implications when in fact it doesn't complain that i am ms waldman's target audience and i won't go down that easily but it's amazing it is the extension of a conversation that is happening in people's heads right now her illustration shows that the conversation in my head right now is somewhat indebted to trendy harvard grads from nearly twenty years ago there isn't really a direct connection though the interior space and motives of nate are thoroughly investigated by waldman it was very shrewd of her to write this novel from a male perspective her feat of intuition is grand and makes me wish it on everybody she creates insights into how people drift from relationships that illuminate our very own thoughts it is so precise and exacting she uses side characters to promote alternate views and to build a case it seems that each person she created has validity in their reasoning this is what charges good writing characters become real people when their motives are clear and coherent it doesn't matter if they are right or wrong she plays with latte liberalism all throughout exposing its weaknesses and defending the strengths clearly she supports this position as one could only write this book if they were such but perhaps one could really only read and feel it at that level too and the whole point of the tale is too show how complicated and absolutely not shallow the entire ordeal is navigating human connection while trying to maintain some sort of fluctuating ethical code does not deserve some clever title alone moving from person to person is shown for what it is without too much interference from overt moralizing the most interesting thing about the book is what the people say they sound like people i know but unity exists in their discussions because it all works from the mind of the solo writer their discussions of art and politics could be read and written infinitely the references throughout the book are diverse enough to be fresh yet familiar i want to say hannah was too frail but she was dealt with expertly her character was loose and impeccable and perfect for nate this whole world was and that is because this seems more like a memoir which isn't a fault the best art mimics reality i love when art seems to exist in its best possible state of all hypothetical products this book is the way it is and is probably the best state it could be","201":"i'm not quite sure what all the hype is about don't get me wrong it's not a bad read i just felt that there wasn't anything that really happened nate is a guy i could see a bit of myself in although i find his treatment of any of his past and sometimes present female counterparts to be less than desired overall i didn't feel the need to rush through it's pages","202":"some of the blandest soylent green i've ever eaten where there should be a window into the male psyche there's a mile thick concrete wall","203":" dragging at times but it paints a very interesting insight into the male psyche how accurate it is i wouldn't know although i have a feeling not all men are as shallow as the protagonist nathaniel p an on the rise 30 something fixture in new york's literary scene although i swear i can attest to a few of nate's behavior as true with most men it felt like a social study and observation of men's dating behavior with a novel in between pages that the final paragraph took me by surprise a pleasant one at that is it just me or did anyone else notice that the final paragraph was in future tense contrary to the rest of the book which was in past tense view spoiler that seems to connote a very interesting cliffhanger sort of leaving open nathaniel's conclusion of his feelings for hannah therefore exposing his vulnerability hide spoiler","204":" this was probably the best character exposition piece that i have ever read mixed with an astute social commentary and the language was just beautiful every line every piece of dialogue every description was perfectly sculpted and intelligent i feel like in that respect after reading the about the author section the author was almost writing about a male version of herself and for a female to have written in what seems like such an insightful way about a man i can only assume not being a man myself is incredibly impressive i very much admire this author and the story itself was well drawn out i honestly could not decide how i felt about nate but i think that's what made this portrait of him feel so real sometimes i would be so angry with his assumptions and other times i would examine my own thoughts actions based on his inner dialogue to see if i was guilty of some of the things he described but in following him through his love affairs i found i really could not put the book down despite the fact that really there was no plot in the traditional sense it was almost like reading an indie film about a day in the life in the best way honestly very very insightful read i definitely recommend it","205":"i'd heard a bit about this debut novel before i read it i enjoyed u0026amp appreciated the brooklyn locations but man was it an eye opening look into one self absorbed 30 year old male u0026amp how he stumbles coldly through relationships i certainly hope he's in the minority would love to ask the author how he came to write this from the male perspective u0026amp where the inspiration came from","206":" more like a 3 5 but i usually round up the most surprising thing about reading this book was that i almost cried reading the last few pages after spending most of the book wanting to punch nate in the face waldman is a very skilled writer i'd read another book of hers in a heart beat i can't wait to discuss this in my book group edit this book provoked one of the best discussions we've had in book group if you're part of a book group i highly recommend this novel nate provokes lots of feelings","207":"a quick read that came off like the plot of a season of sex and the city the twist it's written from the guy's perspective the overly intellectual and at times down right pretentious mental meanderings of a guy living in brooklyn and trying to rationalize his ever changing feelings toward the women he's dating why does he always want what he doesn't have is it possible to be a feminist and still think most women are crazy how can a relationship that was so easy and exciting when it started become so tedious and annoying and downright exhausting at the end smartly written this book still came across as a more elaborate version of he's just not that into you if you head into it with that expectation it's definitely an enjoyable read i just didn't find it particularly enlightening or original","208":"i didn't much like nathaniel p and that's ok i recognized the hell out of him as well as the other characters and appreciated this story and adelle waldman's incisive writing waldman is able to speak to universals even while dealing with a small subculture that many people will recognize as being exported from brooklyn to most artsy neighborhoods and communities funny frustrating and very real","209":"well written but the characters were almost all narcissists and intellectual hipsters which made it not a very enjoyable read if you empathize with the characters on girls you'll probably enjoy it a lot more than i did","210":"i like this book my brain kind of worked like nathaniel's when i was dating in college i enjoyed reading about the lives of fairly successful writers also and i liked the hipters throughout the book the characters were all compelling not everyone in my book club loved this though","211":"it's was an interesting read given its a males pov written by a woman there were times i wanted to scream at the main character and literally break up with him myself a good quick read","212":"couldn't distinguish between real life and this novel the characters are so well built and the sentiments are too real i can't wait for ms waldman's next novel","213":"i think the point of this book was to make me want someone to slap the main character in that case it was extremely well done","214":"so i found this novel on npr's list of best books 2013 which may be a potential gold mine of great recommendations this book reminds me of lena dunham's girls if it was a book and was told from the male perspective one of the things that's most remarkable is that it's written incredibly well by a woman and again from a man's perspective a unique read about the literary dating scene in brooklyn specifically the descriptions of nate's character as he evaluates himself from one encounter with a woman to the next felt more real than anything i've read in a similar vein","215":" this is basically a buzzfeed list of \"20 people you'll meet in your late 20s early 30s\" expanded into a book just as enjoyable but also just as vapid i've absolutely never read anything that so completely abandoned \"show don't tell\" without being consigned to the grocery store romance section--an admirable feat of marketing if nothing else in \"love affairs\" the publisher has strategically constructed a book about privileged self indulgent navel gazing wannabe writers for the exclusive consumption of privileged self involved navel gazing wannabe writers and because i'm one of those i couldn't put the damn thing down touche henry holt-macmillan i am baffled by the decision to leave this book in the third person but nonetheless i yield i say \"the publisher\" because it's pretty evident to me that adelle waldman didn't have a tremendous amount to do with this book not like some reviewers because i think she has some implausibly accurate view of the male m o --the protagonist is not exactly the malest of males for starters--but because the pert over produced writing smacks of edited to all hell seriously read waldman's acknowledgment page where presumably permitted to string a few sentences together unsupervised she pens such inane constructions as \"speaking of britain\" and \"your line edits were terrific \" the latter--verbatim --twice on the other hand maybe this suspicion is biased here's either waldman or her editor on the internal logic of nate's and my reading lists the kind of writing he preferred seemed inherently masculine the writers who impressed him most weren't animated by a sense of personal grievance they were unlikely to say write poems called \"mommy \" of course that wasn't an accurate characterization of all or most writing by women still the fact was that when he read something he admired something written today--fiction nonfiction didn't matter--there was about an 80 percent chance that a guy wrote it guilty","216":"really enjoyed this even though i didn't like nate very much by the end of the book it seems to be a fairly realistic description of how men think about women and view relationships with them eyeopening","217":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i honestly don't know why i finished this one all the reviews said it was an incredibly realistic glimpse into a man's mind i hope that's not true the whole book was centered around a pretty short relationship that kind of just showed that overall nathaniel was a jerk i kept hoping he would step up and start being a decent guy but nope just not my favorite book","218":"4 5until i find proof otherwise i feel like this is really how boys in ny think act or maybe hopefully it's just how girls think boys think","219":"it ended up more seriously than i had thought this little treatise on men and women and how men treat women in relationships would it got real serious halfway to the end and pretty much stayed that way i like nathaniel as a character his choices although some that would make you grimace and question chivalry and modern love are thought out and funny in parts overall not bad until it got serious then it lost me a bit","220":"this book had moments of prose that felt so true ideas i have been trying to write or think about for a long time just presented on the page in one sentence naturally i thoroughly liked the blaming of the man in situations where the 'emotional' woman would typically be at 'fault' i tend to pick books about upper crust ivy league grads ambitious in their mid twenties because hey i can relate and upon finishing them feel guilty that i didn't read something more important","221":"i rarely read books with a male as the protagonist but i don't think that's why i didn't like the book in reality if i knew the characters i would hate them all and find them extremely grating and annoying waldman's style of writing though was enjoyable regardless of what the book was actually about because i try to relate myself to any character in a book i think i didn't enjoy this as much as so many others because i couldn't relate to hannah","222":"if i believed men though everything that waldman thinks they do call me depressed but you do believe it it's quite well done","223":" this is a fun read especially for anyone who has ever been part of academic intellectual circles the author perfectly captures the way certain former nerd guys view and treat women the women he meets fall into different groups the beautiful the smart the needy watching the way he falls for them and later realizes he yet again doesn't want a relationship made me feel so glad not to be in the dating world the only downside to this book was that every time i put it down i found it difficult to pick up again once i started reading i always enjoyed it but the story was not intriguing enough to keep me looking forward to my next chance to read overall i enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone wondering why didn't he text","224":" what a dick bag sorry i can't help saying it the namesake and narrator is such a self centered calculating prig i found myself getting pretty heated up in the defense of these poor women and how he viewed and treated them which i suppose is a fantastic commentary on the writer's ability to tell a tale and to create a character that said i can't help but think that someone once did her wrong very very wrong i just can't believe that there is a man out there that is in touch with himself enough to realize when he is being horrible yet not care at all i feel like me probably probably do treat women in the way that is described in this book but unlike this book i can't imagine that they are so consciences of it i won't believe that as much as i like this book it kind of comes off as a 300 page woman compiling about an ex in the guise of a novel i hope that is not the case but it kind of comes off that way","225":"the only reason it got two stars was because it justified every hateful feeling i've had towards some of the jerks i've dated","226":"i really can't tell if i despise the main character because the author carefully crafted an honest representation of how men even good guys view women spoiler alert they're disgusted and bored by their very nature or if waldman is a self hating femini not either way the characters were inconsistent and treated as objects to prop up some thick statement about young people don't get me wrong i kept reading but i feel like this one missed the mark","227":"waldman is a skilled novelist who deftly and convincingly gets into the head of an over privileged over educated young male in brooklyn but i found the whole thing a little too insular to really connect with","228":"disappointing first effort by adelle waldman she should not have chosen a male protagonist she can't quite capture the male ethos as nate goes from one relationship to another the story becomes repetitive and predictable lots of unnecessary name dropping of prestigious colleges","229":"the subject matter is that of your typical rom com set in nyc but the writing is wry and sharp which enhances the non unique story and characters serving to keep the reader on his her toes","230":" ate this book in three sittings very enjoyable adelle waldman really digs in to the mind of the modern dating man nate was relatable and not always likable through his relationships we're taken through all the stages of dating including the messy break ups that take place in a world in which we're always connected ah the e mails both sent and unsent my only complaint is that the book suffered from what i refer to as the try hardedness which often hits first time novelists waldman threw in a handful of words ex gesticulative and i think i counted four wan s every so often when more common words would have sufficed the effect is grating but not unforgivable my advice is to pick this book up asap with a debut like this i see adelle waldman taking off in the next few years hurry up and get in on the ground floor side note the hardcover version is slick and the cover spine are gorgeous i look forward to having this on my bookshelf for both substance and style","231":"married ladies if you want to know what you're missing out on read this horribly written book about the perverted pretentious and flaky nathaniel p not only did this remind me of way too many guys out there who are commitment phobes always looking for the next best thing but the vocabulary used made it impossible to follow what the characters were saying skip this one","232":" waldman's satirical writing is on point but at the same time awfully excruciating she approaches nate's adventures from a distance with a smirk as though her ability to sniff out white privilege is to be admired or ironically appreciated while waldman's writing style is immensely readable it quickly becomes tedious unable to add any depth or revelation to a deliberately unlikeable character and lastly satire or otherwise do we really need another story about a white male literary intellectual in new york city","233":" this book may be difficult to get through the everyday minutiae of nate's life is not particularly pleasant to read but it's nate himself and the way he feels that tested my patience the entire way till the very end nate's likability is undoubtedly a subject of debate concerning this novel but it does become clear that there is very little redemptive quality to the narrator's portrayal of his character you will find little personal growth or searching or revelation nate is treated with irony and skill and no compromise his issues are fairly layered he carries a deep seated misogyny but feels guilty about it his guilt likewise has the effect of feeding his misogyny he deliberately leads an unexamined life to sidestep these guilty feelings he takes refuge in his intellectual hubris as a marker of his masculine identity he is unable or unwilling to think beyond his own masculine experience he is trapped in the filter of his own feelings he felt that it struck him as it made him feel which becomes increasingly self preserving and precious as his relationship with hannah progresses he is frustrated with women who read him accurately because that would mean they are pinning him down and how dare a woman try to pin him down the list goes on waldman does a very good job with him and the fact that she's a woman makes it even more impressive this is all unveiled during nate's relationship with hannah which is thankfully the brunt of the novel it's this relationship that allows for a deeper more psychological more personally fraught scenario than the novel's default which is to portray the pervasive status mongering posturing self satisfaction and romantic connoisseur ing that happen whenever young brooklyn literati gather together nate and hannah's relationship is fairly complex and begs for a reckoning on nate's part a lot of the novelistic tension comes from whether or not nate will in fact get his reckoning waldman complicates the ending a little bit but the ending remains consistent even too consistent with nate's character overall a smart book my irritation with it came from the fact that waldman never allowed the characters to outsmart her or act in defiance to the expectations laid out for them her technique is a throwback to nineteenth century realism she is astute and descriptive but not very generous or imaginative","234":"well written but dull","235":"i appreciated the way a women wrote from a man's perspective i thought that brought a new change that was more than welcome the love affairs of nathaniel p had a beginning and an ending but it never actually stopped by the end of the book i could already imagine nate's future i could picture what would happen to his present relationship and his book i loved the book and its roller coaster through nate's relationships and feelings and nate in fact was an asshole","236":"comparison of this book with the marriage plot by eugenides is inevitable and works entirely in the latter's favor indeed waldman's novel comes off as an inferior imitation of something by eugenides eugenides inhabiting madeline's mind is much more convincing than adelle as nate much better dialogue is to be found in eugenides's book as well as much more probing insight this book was unsatisfying in many ways writing lacked propulsive energy got repetitive in certain parts material felt sorely limiting suffered from poor editing the same sentence was printed twice within the space of a few paragraphs and the characters were not very well developed some were only hastily sketched or interesting the only things i underlined were rare displays of wit reptilian ambition and the occasional brilliant simile her face was slow to change expression like an old clock face behind which heavy wheels had to turn and facts reconfiguring themselves like marbles in a tipped bowl i didn't learn anything from this novel it just reinforced my ideas of what it's like to scrape together a living as a journalist cum novelist and i will likely forget about it after a few days it does make me wary of reading other contemporary fiction and i've lost respect for some of the people who provided blurbs for this book","237":" some awfully good writing is wasted in a banal plot and a pretty sad excuse for a central character the more i read the more i disliked nate piven though i have to admit that aside from one of his affairs hannah i disliked almost all the characters in this story i'm a bit weary of the wasted days of ivy leaguers with literary ambitions and a sour perspective on life this book often seems to be a rehash of the bleakness one finds in jay mcinerny sp or walter kirn nathaniel is pretty totally self absorbed and almost always peeved when he wounds someone always a woman in this story their pain usually annoys him and yet makes him feel guilty he is astonishingly lacking in self knowledge despite being exhaustingly introspective i found especially repellant his refusal time and again to tell an intimate friend what his feelings really were in the end nate is arrogant smug self absorbed and just a bad guy but all this is cloaked in a kind of literary pretentiousness and angst which is supposed to make it interesting treating people badly is not interesting it's just sad there seems a possibility that the intent of this book is to make it clear than men are jerks certainly nate and his male buddies who have retained adolescent qualities well into their thirties fully qualify but it is hard to find redeeming qualities in many of the female characters as well elisa and juliet are hardly engaging or likable for instance and why did all these characters attend elite institutions if that is supposed to make them interesting it fails miserably all the characters male and female seem to think highly of themselves and inappropriately so the bottom line for me is that privileged children who refuse to grow up and live on low income and high pretension are not what i want to read about this book was relatively short so i finished it and it somehow ended up on the recommended reading shelf of my local library i am astonished at the critical acclaim this book seems to have garnered and i am disappointed and even a little offended with the assumption in this book that nate is a character of literary value","238":"i knew nate was going to be disagreeable before i read a single sentence so i made a concerted effort to be as nonjudgmental and open to his character as possible if written off as an ass before opening the book i think you will quickly find yourself disgusted i've read a lot of books about relationships i didn't find this to be a rehash of the same old same old simple because my entire life and i suspect a few other people's are about the relationships we have with ourselves and others i enjoy reading about them and finding bits of recognition and similarity with the characters i think it's easy to get rubbed the wrong way on this one because it's mostly going to force you to admit or perhaps suggest that you might have at one time in your life of course a very long time ago when you were immature and inexperienced and stupid unlike the mature self you are now and when you would of course never exhibit any kind of behaviors illustrated here because we all only make those kinds of mistakes once and immediately turn into darling and upright adults perhaps suggest that you might have at one time in your life acted like nate or elisa or hannah and aren't exactly looking back with approval and pride i would be lying if i didn't relate to both nate and hannah in their childish behavior toward one another and lying if i hadn't been in a similar relationship and it of course stung to recognize the similarities while also having the bleak truth laid out in an inescapable and blunt way like that time i dated a nate and was the sad depressed and overly worried hannah and the author of a very pathetic email i am a confirmed human so why deny it yes it's kind of annoying to read about superficial characters but i also laughed at recognizing similar moments in my life it made me sympathize a bit with many of them which again was only possible because i decided not to hate nate before actually opening the book and recognizing that it was going to be about a specific microcosm that i would not choose to life or work in however i do feel that stylistically this felt a bit forced like it went through two maybe three hundred full draft edits during which all of the simpler sentences were gussied up with unique big fancy words to really push the erudite snobbery of the characters but i get it i got it after the first chapter no need to keep hammering at it things might have come off as less offensively pretentious if that aspect had been toned down a bit and i don't think we'd have found the characters any less obnoxious and though i don't feel like it was severely staged i did get a bit tired of the overly stereotyped routines and scenes e g nate's absurdly filthy and neglected apartment the coffee shops the bars and parties i've never been to brooklyn or been in the writing world so perhaps that's actually how it is which increases the satiric value of the story a good thing but i could have done with a few less descriptive sentences as above i don't need to have it rehashed in every chapter in a short book like this we're only seeing the characters engaged in dialogue that describes their stereotype to a nauseating degree e g jason and aurit holy cow that was the same scene about twelve times over but that did get old given that the characters are far from center stereotypes with the added bonus of all characters being obnoxious i did not find hannah enjoyable or an innocent victim it does make it a bit much to take in at times so i like the story and i definitely applaud the honesty of the portrayal which is again why i think it's so biting i definitely threw the book across my bed at one point but did pick it up fifteen minutes later i had no trouble reading it in a few days i would have given it 4 stars if i hadn't needed to resist skimming some of the sections that droned on for too long with very pretentious wording and references i approached it as a satire which is why i think i liked it oh and not hating on nate before you reflect on him honestly and acknowledging the reality that his actions and inability to be responsible are not confined to assholes is very helpful you will not like this book if you don't want to be reminded of the times when you too may have been a nate male or female","239":"i'm glad this was written and i'm glad i read it but jeez that was upsetting","240":"waldman does an exceptional job of getting into the head of a modern man and dissecting the nuances that make him tick certain ways when it comes to romance her portrayal of nate was so well written and with such detail that i had to put the book down sometimes because he made me wince a good thing highly recommend this book","241":"reasons why this book didn't do it for me 1 not from brooklyn2 not 253 not in the literary scenei'm not even sure what the point of this book was some guy started dating a girl who was nice enough but he just wasn't that into her ok somehow that took up 300 pages it wasn't horrible it just wasn't very interesting either","242":"part whit stillman part comedy of manners and part xojane it happened to me the love affairs of nathaniel p drew me in but halfway through i was tired it wasn't the writing it was nate and hannah and aurit and greer and all the other terrible people with names that could only be acceptable in brooklyn chris eigeman could complain about his first world problems the same way that nate does but the difference is metropolitan winks at us while love affairs just stares at it's own feet maybe i'm just too old to really like this","243":" amazon description \"he was not the kind of guy who disappeared after sleeping with a woman--and certainly not after the condom broke on the contrary nathaniel piven was a product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education he had learned all about male privilege moreover he was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience \" - from the love affairs of nathaniel p nate piven is a rising star in brooklyn's literary scene after several lean and striving years he has his pick of both magazine assignments and women juliet the hotshot business reporter elisa his gorgeous ex girlfriend now friend and hannah \"almost universally regarded as nice and smart or smart and nice \" who is lively fun and holds her own in conversation with his friends in this 21st century literary world wit and conversation are not at all dead is romance novelist adelle waldman plunges into the psyche of a modern man--who thinks of himself as beyond superficial judgment yet constantly struggles with his own status anxiety who is drawn to women yet has a habit of letting them down with tough minded intelligence and wry good humor the love affairs of nathaniel p is an absorbing tale of one young man's search for happiness--and an inside look at how he really thinks about women sex and love my take this book reminded me a little bit of tucker max's i hope they serve beer in hell but without as much raunch the central character reminds me of that sorta jerky guy who can't commit most women have known a guy like him at some point in their lives i really enjoyed the main storyline and was drawn in to nathan's honest self reflections of his character and flaws there was much too emphasis placed on the literary scene in brooklyn and this was where the book fell short for me not only did it not feel realistic but the book teemed with self importance that was conveyed through endless philosophical conversations","244":"meh i had a hard time caring about any of the vapid characters was this waldman's intention i found nate p to represent the worst of modern men he is in short a jerk waldman is a decent writer and i enjoyed her writing style but i disliked her characters this book was a good guide on how not to be in the modern world essentially don't be a navel gazing yuppie","245":"i was a bit disappointed in this book the premises appeared like it could hold weight a young man looking for love instead i found the main character to be shallow and unlikable in fact there were not many characters i did like in this book i also thought the writing style was too wordy and complicated i felt the author was trying to hard to work words into the text this could have been a better read","246":"yeah the lead character is a total ass still sometimes it's interesting to get into a brain that acts on a totally different plane from your own felt particularly appropriate for my generation and geography being based in nyc brooklyn","247":"i have never disliked a main character more than i have the main character in this book it made me hate the entire story immensely","248":" in reality this would probably be 4 5 stars but i'll round up today based on degree of difficulty make no mistake what waldman has achieved here is truly impressive for a woman to capture so vividly the voice of a man who doesn't understand women at all can't have been easy but she really made it feel effortless and natural the book covers about a year in nate's life as he anticipates his first novel being published and embarks on a new relationship with a woman he meets at an ex girlfriend's party as the relationship progresses his meandering thoughts in third person limited uncover details on the women in his past some of whom we have met and are now being shaded some of whom are new to us none of the characters are archetypes or easy each one even those who only come in and out of the story briefly feel three dimensional and like waldman spent a long time thinking about their personalities their relationships with nate and other characters and how they would think interact and react in the situations presented the brooklyn her characters inhabit feels real and has texture and she understands that particular ecosystem and the people who populate it think girls but 10 years on and told from the guys' perspective while i'm sure waldman would hate this comparison as she's no doubt been working on this since before hannah horvath was a glimmer in lena dunham's eye it's the most apt comparison in pop culture today in fact if i had one criticism it's the ten years on part nate doesn't particularly seem like he's in his mid 30s none of the characters do really but that's the information we're given and i suppose the details all fit the tortured artist lifestyle bottom line if you want your characters interesting and sometimes infuriating rather than likeable an overused and overrated term this is the book for you if you want clear emotions pat endings and cliches move on","249":"i bought this book after reading a glowing review in the washington post the post article made much of the similarities between the author's writing and that of jane austen i think the comparison is appropriate the author's commentary on the brooklyn literati and ivy league graduates was often really funny nate is a great character although definitely self absorbed and hard to take at times if you live in new york and are a part of the publishing industry you will probably also get more of the humor than i did here's the thing i know that the \"love affair of nathaniel p \" is supposed to be an indictment of a certain type of man many have called nate a misogynist but while he definitely had his flaws i didn't think he was that bad of a guy i am concerned that my urge to defend him somehow makes me deeply flawed i think anyone who has experience singlehood through parts of their 30's has both dated someone like nate someone who just wasn't that into them although maybe he thought he should be and likely has shown some nate ish qualities in a relationship not breaking up with someone sooner even though you probably should have he liked hannah well enough but he wasn't crazy about her some of his observations about minor flaws in her physical appearance were obnoxious and maddening but i think everyone does this when they're in a relationship with an otherwise good and nice person who just happens to be not quite what they are looking for in a partner i really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down i also had a lot of fun trying to decide whether i liked or disliked nate highly recommended","250":"this book was very well written and the author was very perceptive in her portrayal of a man's take on his relationships i did not like nate as was probably the author's intentions but i did not understand him very well either he struggles between a animalistic prejudiced male and a respectful intelligent writer at times the actions seemed a bit forced but overall this was a good book","251":"i kind of really loved this slash felt deeply uncomfortable about how accurately it depicted things in my life or in lives only one or two degrees removed from mine which is i guess what every single review i've seen says probably because every single review i've seen is written by someone one or two degrees removed from my life someone who doesn't live in brooklyn didn't work in publishing needs to tell me what they think of it","252":"i was ready to drop it after the first 10 15 pages but give it a chance yes the characters are annoying at first but eventually we get to the reality and it is spot on","253":"i hated nate and most of his love affairs but i finished the book and read it quite quickly so i'm not sure how to rate this","254":"sure nate's an ass but that's what makes this book good we've all dated those people who aren't ready and we're friends with a bunch of them is this the best book i've ever read no is the book and the characters at all relatable very much i would recommend this book to the dating set of people out there you may hate it you're going to hate nate but that's the point","255":"my friend it's about a jerk novelist who mistreats women me i thought it was just about a novelist loved it http betterbooktitles com post 5782","256":"this is a great beach read waldman nails the nyc literary scene as well as male female relationships of people in their 20s early 30s took me back to the summer i interned at random house like no other i feel like i know many men and women like nate like hannah like aurit or perhaps a little bit of them is in each one of us there's a lot of talk in other comments about this book that waldman hates her characters i don't think so i think she exposes tendencies demandingness self indulgence while calling out others' faults etc in a typical mid upper class highly educated american population that we can see all over we can read the book in two ways a light relationship sex romp as well as a fairly significant comment on early adulthood in the us while it's not especially pretty it's accurate","257":" major page turner i was so skeptical of this book at first mostly because of the title and cover love affairs of nathaniel p sounded like a waspy extension of 50 shades of grey to me but my local bookstore buy books locally convinced me otherwise and then i couldn't put it down for three days the writing is great the subject matter feels so accurate that it's at times cringe worthy and it's a lot of fun to hate the protagonist great read perfect book for the holiday you'll finish it in a day","258":" it often amazes me how writers can get into the minds of people quite different from themselves and write about them in compelling and interesting ways wisconsin based writer jennifer morales did this with her collection of short stories in meet me halfway milwaukee stories matthew dicks did this with his novel the perfect comeback of caroline jacobs now adele waldman does this in the love affairs of nathaniel p meet nathaniel piven or nate to his friends and lovers without a doubt those of us of the gentler sex are quite familiar with nate we have dated them some of us have even married a nate who is nate nate is a thirty something freelance writer living and loving in brooklyn awaiting the release of his first novel a majority of his friends are also writers and other assorted creative types he is also one of the most maddening man types--the nice guy douchebag hybrid--the type of guy who has frustrated womankind since the beginning of time the nice guy part is the nate that chooses to be with women are smart educated and have their own aspirations and ambitions the douchebag side rejects basically decent women for minor infractions like jiggly upper arms professional difficulties or showing the wee bit of anger or sadness in other words how dare nate's girlfriends being actual human beings and it doesn't help that one of nate's best friends is the detestable jason a total jerk who thinks no women is worth it unless she is supermodel hot and has an iq somewhere hovering around room temperature unfortunately nate takes jason's so called counsel way too seriously instead of making up his own mind like a grown man should at this point nate is dating hannah hannah is also a writer and is currently struggling with finishing a book proposal for her own book often writing a book proposal can be more difficult than writing the actual book hannah is bright engaging and seems to have no problem keeping up with nate's coterie of literary friends who they hang out with at parties coffee shops bars and local restaurants like any other woman hannah has her own faults like jiggly arms--the nerve and she often lets her lack of self esteem color her decisions like her relationship with nate staying with him for far too long at times i said to myself \"hannah kick nate to the curb you deserve so much better \" of course i had to take a hard look at myself and examine my own questionable romantic choices but back to nate while dating hannah nate muses about the girlfriends he had before hannah including his girlfriends from high school and college nate never fails to remind the reader he went to harvard to woman he dated before hannah throughout these passages nate ponders why he was drawn to these women and dated them while being only too quick to point out the qualities that made them only ms right now not ms right sure many of these ladies probably weren't the type to be the mrs to mr piven but a lot of them seemed perfectly decent and quite lovely and it's not as if nate wasn't a mere mr right now to some exes and not mr right but nate is a bit too self absorbed at times to realize that he is part of the relationship equation and he has plenty of work to do to be an ideal husband does nate stay with hannah or does he look for greener pastures when it comes to the fairer sex well you'll just have to read the book though at times a frustrating nate is an absorbing character adelle waldman expertly writes about a man who at turns is both simple and complex i also appreciated how she captured the world of freelance writers publishers authors and other creative types that populate the big apple and though i live in flyover country i could totally relate to writer scene that makes up nate's friends one of support and competition pretentious and neuroticism and i must admit the love affairs of nathaniel p made me take a hard look at myself and all the time i wasted on the nates in my life no doubt female readers of this book will have their own alphabet of nate ps and as for the male readers of the love affairs of nathaniel i hope this novel makes them examine their own romantic choices and examine them with more maturity and clarity originally published at the book self https thebookselfblog wordpress com","259":"not much plot to this book and i certainly didn't love the main character but it thought the writing was very good and quite intelligent","260":"read my review on amazon","261":" if dating in brooklyn even remotely resembles the drivel spewed forth by this novel i thank my lucky stars i'm not single nathaniel is a self absorbed whiny navel gazer who passes judgment on those around him as if he is zeus ranking the mortals from mount olympus i have no idea why this novel received such acclaim but it was truly painful to get through the female characters save for hannah are treated with disdain and turned into vapid caricatures of a post sex in the city new york this is one of the most misogynistic stories i've ever had the misfortune of reading which is shocking considering a woman wrote it it's possible the whole point of this novel is to mockingly call out all the men in society who act and think this way but the story and the characters are so insufferable any satirical intentions the author had are completely lost if i could give this book no stars i would unfortunately i don't have that option","262":"i pretty much hated this book though admit that it's readable too much telling and not enough showing","263":"whew i'm not sure how many stars to give this book because while it's exceptionally written it also made me so mad that i wanted to throw it across the room which i think is kind of the point there seems to be a lot of people who think nate is unsympathetic and i have to agree that by the end of the book he really was still it's an interesting look at dating sex from the perspective of someone who actively thinks of himself as a fairly chivalrous good guy and it points out a lot of inconsistencies and heart break that having less traditional gender roles opens up nonetheless if i had less restraint there would be a huge book shaped hole in my wall","264":"it was fine i guess the characters didn't really resonate that much with me even though it's written well and captures reasonably well what the main character is going through it just seems like it's about a certain of person that the author didn't successfully make interesting the foppish male new yorker writer hanging out with upper middle class people and nabbing girls like it's no big deal what's really compelling about that there are a few moments that touch on the male experience a little bit like that grass is always greener feeling that nags you sometimes when you're with a person but it doesn't really reach for more than that it is well written though so it's a decent read","265":"what can you expect out of someone from baltimore unfortunately this sort of relationship immaturity brought about largely from the sexual revolution and selfishness of babyboomers has affected and continues to affect generations of americans it is nearly impossible to find something lasting in a disposable world","266":"well written even though a bit pretentious at times however that writing style really personifies the main character who is pretty self absorbed he wasn't very likeable but i still enjoyed the story","267":"per usual i can't decide how to rate this i loved reading about new york writers and their social lives and it was refreshing to read about relationships from the male point of view but also frustrating since the main character was pretty infuriating at times and i do wonder about a woman writing from a man's point of view i found it very believable but what do i know","268":"i couldn't put this down adelle waldman probably knows guys better than they know themselves and sheds some light on the common young man both to himself and any of her interested readers i highly recommend to anyone looking for a fast and addicting read","269":" nathaniel p part of brooklyn's young literati complete with a decent book deal is on his way to a dinner party at his ex girlfriend turned just friend's apartment when he runs into a different ex who in their brief exchange shames him for his past bad behavior his social crime getting her pregnant playing the role of a supportive boyfriend through the trip to the abortion clinic and a day of recovery calling to check in with her then never talking to her ever again he can justify this he can justify almost anything finding a new girlfriend at his old girlfriend's dinner party sizing up one woman while on a date with another being sickened by his lover's slack underarms which have defied her devotion to pilates adelle waldman's debut novel \"the love affairs of nathaniel p\" is a super ugly portrait of modern love among the young and restless \" nate the quintessential sexually entitled asshole is 30 a freelance writer with a small circle of friends living in a neighborhood on the cusp of hipster takedown he went to harvard that's one of the first things he would tell you he had a serious relationship that started in college but since that ended has soured mightily on women he's got plenty of generalizations about how they act and what they say and what it means and and how awful it all is for him in the meantime he doesn't have a hard time finding one or two that are willing to date him and then revel in his loathsomeness in an obsessive way when it all ends mostly the novel focuses on his time with hannah also a writer who seems skeptical of nate but gradually falls into it with him she's smart his friends like her though nate thinks they would believe her to be about a 7 on the attractiveness scale and this bothers him especially when faced with a prettier yet dimmer woman his friend is dating there is the whole falling in love slow dance to the bedroom and onset of the relationship eventually this is upended when after a bad day nate begins to notice the seams in his partner her underarms jiggle why haven't her friends told her that he ass looks bad in those jeans she's being emotionally manipulative he begins to pull away from her then expresses surprise when she's hurt it turns into a treat her bad treat her awesome tango until they are forced into a series of state of the relationship convos each more exhausting than the last technically the book is okay it's full of exposition and unnecessary back stories and occasional filler characters that lend little to the narrative plot wise it's simple a party a coffee shop my apartment her apartment and interactions with women including an aggressive ex still it's a struggle to cut it loose there is something addictive about the entitlement and whining and imagined torture of the titular character the lecherous looks and manipulation the way a reader might want hannah to haul off and nail him in the nuts but instead she disavows every strong woman sensibility she's developed in her life to try to make things work there is nothing redeeming about nate nothing to make a reader sympathetic to his inability to be in a relationship not even the revelation that before he had enough lit cred to wow a woman or two he had been not so cool in high school the kind of guy who attracts the attention of a smart girl with frizzy hair instead of the it girl whose scrunchy he sniffs in the privacy of his bedroom waldman's book sounds like retaliation lit the kind of words jotted in anger to express a frustration in men trends and incredulousness about how sometimes a smart woman gets her feet stuck in the muck and finds herself uncharacteristically asking in a voice she doesn't recognize \"are you mad at me \" there are two ways to take this book a reader can get annoyed at nate his generalizations and disdain for women and annoyed with the women who sometimes seem to fall right into his unflattering characterizations a reader can throw her kindle at the wall and say \"c'mon why do i want to read about such awful people \" or a reader can ooze through it like reality television but the real kind of reality television hidden cameras stolen dream journals flipping the scab with a thumb nail to see how it attaches to the skin one might suspect that this ugly ugly look at dating in brooklyn in 20 whatever has enough real to it to make a player cringe in embarrassment and bring back a slide show of a decade of bad decision making","270":" i liked the book at the start because the language was very snappy and precise but as the story unrolled i because increasingly annoyed by the main character to the point where i just disliked the whole idea of the book the focus on the dysfunctional inability of the main male to form proper attachments while constantly evaluating them was extremely annoying that being said again the writing was good in fact very good if you have the patience for a modern tale and one that might very well ring true and boy is that scary then read waldman's book","271":"i do not quite see why so many people hate the character of nate in many ways he is a sympathetic protagonist who is trying to figure life out for better or worse then i could see various aspects of my life embodied in nate and his indecisions about how to approach life as much as i have read the negatives about nate and the negative opinions of him i cannot bring myself to say he is bad he has his opinions and preferences is he always validated in them does any character in fiction need to be","272":"i loved this book it was very different from what i'm used to read the one thing i disagree with most of the reviews i read is many women often think exactly like nate his behavior isn't exclusive of intellectual boys that being said excellent portrait of a self centered man and his relationships a main character doesn't have to be the prime of kindness and sensibility mrs adelle waldman i'm a fan","273":"a debate recently raged across the pages of slate and the new yorker is likability a sin among fictional characters if you've lived your life blissfully unaware of this tempest take heart - for most readers it'd likely prove a bore for the vast majority such writerly squabbles are beside the point - either you enjoy a book and so - bless you - you keep turning the page or you find it not to your taste and - god willing - pick up another book instead of flipping on netflix yet i could not help but recall this faux dispute about \"likability\" when reading adelle waldman's \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" a novel whose titular character stands out mostly for being the most unpalatable of a largely unappetizing lot yet despite this - or perhaps because of it - waldman's produced an engaging entertaining read one that i could not put down waldman's protagonist nate is basically a cad a writer living in hipster brooklyn awaiting the release of his first novel he spends an awful lot of time with other literary types as a group nate's friends mostly gossip about the literary world bad mouthing other writers what else do writers do when gathered making literary references mostly to demonstrate the extent of their literacy nate and the subset of his friends who are male spend their time thinking about women to call their thoughts merely shallow would be charitable combining topics they also seem quite concerned about ways to exploit literary knowledge to get women into bed such literary subject matter gives waldman lots of fodder for great descriptions such as \"she'd get this pinched look on her face as if the sheer extravagance of proust's prose was morally objectionable as if there were children in africa who could have better used those excess words \" a discussion about the debt players owe to flaubert is similarly hilarious in case we should doubt how to feel about nate this issue is pretty much settled on page 2 where he encounters an ex girl friend let's just say that his thoughts and actions won't earn him many points from many readers after we get led through nate's romantic history a history which is intimately tied to his concerns about status our hero takes up with a young writer hannah did i mention he met hannah at a party thrown by another of nate's ex girlfriends seemingly moments after nate starts dating hannah he begins to wonder whether or not he's settled his feelings about her rise and fall based on whether his male friends seem inclined to admire or discount her as girlfriend material now if you imagine that any of this is a criticism of waldman's novel perish the thought nate's character works because all of his cad attributes feel deeply familiar waldman may perhaps have artfully distilled dog ness into a fictitiously pure draught but that only adds to her success moreover whatever nate's faults his intelligence sizzles on the page he may be an obnoxious vaguely misogynistic intellectual but he's a keen observer take for example his decision whether to join hannah for brunch with a visiting friend \"hannah had described susan as one of those people who sees her life as a long series of injustices perpetrated against her by various assholes if you take issue with her account you are one of the assholes a real charmer she sounded like \"and then nate's projection of the experience of brunch with hannah and susan t11 00 wait in line with all the other yuppies at hip new restaurant make tired conversation about whatever susan does for a living and new york compres to chicago 11 30 order a bloodly mary still standing outside waiting to be seated 12 00 at the table order inadvisable second blood mary in attempt to stave off creeping boredom existential despair 12 30 split the check and silently regret blowing thirty dollars the extra ten for the second bloody mary when he would have been happier with the six dollar sunday special 2 eggs bacon home fries and toast at the non gentrified diner on his street in case you're concerned nate actually doesn't stand out as being demonstrably worse than the other characters in the novel one of his best friends jason is a magazine editor and feeds all of nate's worst inclinations he offers an amusing theory about why brilliant men must reproduce with hot less than genius model types for the good of the species nate's other best friend seems a better person but that shouldn't count for much since he lives in maine which for the purposes of this new york centric novel new york for these purposes meaning gentrified and gentrifying brooklyn and white manhattan might as well be somewhere between nepal and one of jupiter's less prestigious moons the women characters aren't much better hannah more and more reveals herself to be a dish rag when she wonders aloud that her first impressions of nate were \"smarmy \" \"self satisfied \" and too eager to remind folks he went to harvard we wonder why she didn't go with her gut perhaps because we are mostly in nate's perspective most of the other women seem little better aurit nate's friend and the novel's voice of wisdom comes off as far more level headed assured and capable one begins to suspect she is more than anything the voice of the author as i said the novel is mostly a great old school comedy of manners social satire some who've spent time in brooklyn's lit scene may wonder as to why every writer frequenting waldman's parties are beautiful brilliant and erudite i recall more than a few who wouldn't merit a magazine cover and who slurred unintelligibly half way into most parties yet for those who don't need their characters to be likable and god knows lots of writers aren't likable and can just embrace the satire and enjoy this author's keen eye will surely love waldman's novel","274":"though there is a distinct lack of plot action i still found myself enjoying this book sometimes it's just interesting getting inside someone else's head and this is where we find ourselves with nathaniel p we may not always agree with his actions we may not be rooting for him in the end but we don't have to adelle points out the complexities and misunderstandings of modern romance and life in the 21st century","275":"good insight into a man's way of thinking moral of the story men prefer to end up with women who are hot and sexy and sweet and oh so vulnerable at the same time oh please hold my hand my friend got mugged today i'm so scared and not with women who offer them an intellectual challenge the main character nate makes me want to throw up three stars as it stirred up the revulsion so at least i wasn't indifferent enough to abandon it half way","276":" two things bothered me about this book 1 women no matter how independent hannah or needy greer are always at the verge of tears men no matter how direct jason or subtle nate are always judging women on superficial physical details women are always desperate to be in a relationship according to aurit anytime is a good time men feel trapped in relationships and wish women wouldn't be so desperate i believe middle and upper class young professionals may very well fall into these stereotypes but i do not think they are gender specific and i do not see the point in making it seem like they are 2 nate is a glorified douchebag i felt like his feelings and remorse kept getting shoved down my throat and it is not that the concept of the douchbag bothers me what bother me are all the apologetic reflections i find it easier to empathize with don draper simply because i do not get exposed to all the touchy feely ness that may go on inside his head i found it dull and unnecessary","277":"witty and relatable novel on modern dating i only give it 4 stars bc i wanted to punch the main character at times","278":" adelle waldman deserves five stars for the love affairs of nathaniel p on the strength alone of her use of someone's reaction to proust to so succinctly describe them here the target is one of the protagonist's former girlfriends a semi sickeningly wholesome type at home he'd read kristen bits from proust and she'd get this pinched look on her face as if the sheer extravagance of proust's prose was morally objectionable as if there were children in africa who could have better used those excess words i did however think briefly about giving the book a lower rating mostly because i didn't altogether care for the main character nate at times i envied him with his intellect and his assured pursuit of writing i even related to him as was the occasion when i read this and thought of my own husband and his flair for the dramatic it was not always unpleasant to deal with a hysterical woman one feels so thoroughly righteous in comparison but still i didn't particularly like nate of course to punish the writer for this is unfair her job is after all not to make me feel good but to make me feel this she does skillfully also creating what seemed to me a perfectly authentic if insular world of an early thirty something terribly serious writer in brooklyn","279":"i've noticed a trend that many of those who negatively reviewed this book didn't like it because they found nate the protagonist to be unlikeable or self absorbed i experienced the novel differently for two reasons 1 i believe waldman provided a detailed enough character analysis for nate to help the reader understand his some of shortcomings while i wouldn't say it made me like him i felt that waldman's insights into nate's thoughts and reasoning helped the reader see his inner conflicts and know that he often did in earnest try to be a good guy 2 frankly i felt that this story was honest sure nate is maddeningly frustrating and often a jerk but who doesn't know a guy like that truth is i think all can name a nate or two or three or many in our circle of friends he's an archetype for the modern man who can't commit in many ways i feel like this novel attempted to dive beneath the he's just not that into you argument and tackle the question of why the answer as it turns out isn't always clear even to the man himself which again while maddeningly frustrating is perhaps the sad and honest truth","280":"i give up i have about fifty pages to go but i need to escape this claustrophobic universe i persevered out of a kind of respect for what he author was trying to do write from point of view of a self obsessed ivy league educated brooklyn based writer and dickwad but life is too short there is genuine talent here i hope she redirects it away from her milieu next time while i am at it all of those reviewers who compared the 'satire' here to jane austen should be ashamed of themselves","281":"while i enjoyed the writing style of this book what struck me most was my similarity with the narrator however nate is a male i am not the generalizations about men and women are of course generalizations but part of me can't help but notice i am more like a guy than a girl about relationships or at least about being single and thinking about relationships overall an interesting commentary about modern couples who are my age also who happen to be in new york city and who happen to be paid to write two things i am not at all familiar with but enjoyed reading about because it made me feel like i could have kept up with nate and his friends and their discussions of literature and philosophy","282":"i guess hannah got her book published","283":"in the love affairs of nathaniel p ms waldman tells the tale of a rising star in the literary circles of new york where with his increasing fame women eye him as a prized commodity when once they would barely spare him a passing glance the bulk of the story centers around nate and his relationship with hannah a woman described as smart and nice or nice and smart and the subsequent erosion of his once great feelings the look into nate's life is both stark disturbing and yet so real moments of levity are overshadowed by the train wreck that is nate his absolute callous treatment of women while espousing his beliefs in feminism are cringe worthy ms waldman makes no apologies for nate's behavior and for readers who are hoping for one they will be disappointed despite the constant flurry of social commentary and intellectualism the supporting characters come across as vacuous aurit is the only woman in the story that nate seems to have any respect for they also never dated she seems to represent the intelligent woman who speaks her mind and has it together while dealing with her less than together friend jason represents the typical man who is after the hottest woman around and the one woman he actually has feelings for he is too afraid to confide in but it is jason who summarizes the book perfectly as a rule men want a reason to end a relationship while women want a reason to keep it going jason declared waving his glass that's why after the fact men look to all the things that were wrong with the relationships to confirm the rightness of ending it women on the other hand go back and search for what might have been different what might have made it work yet ms waldman tries too hard there is too much commentary about the macro socioeconomic plights that plague the world too many references about the changes in brooklyn gentrification too much messaging overall that her true message is lost because what of nathaniel p wasn't the book really about him 3 of 5 stars","284":"some other reviewers have given this a low mark because the main character is kind of a unlikeable talk about missing the point this is a forensic dismembering of a certain kind of creative vaguely feminist intellectual jerk and it's note perfect brutal sometimes funny and engagingly written","285":"i would give it 3 1 2 if that was an option it is a good book but not my favorite type of book","286":"waldman unsparingly catalogues the social milieu of publishing diaspora in brooklyn thirty somethings well before the end of the book you start to see why when the revolution comes they shoot the intellectuals first","287":" i am surprised this book was written by a woman the mc nate was a pig a downright pig who thought he was superior than mostly everyone i don't understand the point of the whole book being about his relationship with hannah and they had broken up he didn't change for the better i really think he was with greer because she was beautiful mostly respected and not intellectually superior then he was the book said that when he was with her he didn't have to be thinking about all his other stuff however with hannah i thought he enjoyed to debate and discuss with her say things and do things he would normally with his friends nate pretty much is the conventional guy the asshole who has commitment issues typical i kept waiting to find the point in the book and then the writer decides to let him live happily ever after which really just made me feel like i wasted my life reading this book i mean come on really if this was suppose to be a feminist novel it failed if this was suppose to be an interesting read it failed if this book was to throw out at random times names of other books the author thinks are intellectually interesting then it passed with flying colors i was happy when i was on the last page","288":"it was interesting to read a book where the main character is just a horrible pretentious person as the book gets going i did enjoy it but i hated nate to the very end","289":"the author has a gift for writing conversation and thoughts i found nate so boring and such a damn misogonist that i just couldn't care about such a self involved person and the way he bullied women the fact that he didn't even know that he was a bully was his worst fault it was so fashionable and just another sex and the city ms waldman does have great potential talent and i would try another book by her","290":" i started off not liking this book very much the writing seemed simplistic and i wondered if the contemporary setting and stereotypical popular book packaging was making me not take it seriously but as it went on i understood that this wasn't meant to be a complicated eventful story and it was simply an unfolded and very relatable thought provoking view of a male female push and pull of a relationship so much of both hannah and nate's inner monologues and reactions felt familiar sometimes unpleasantly so but waldman spends more time unpacking these visceral sorts of feelings that perhaps we've absorbed as normal or glossed over unexamined the result is very insightful the descriptions of facial expressions are so spot on that i can fully picture and recognize every exasperated and withering exchange nate is neither entirely criminalized nor forgiven waldman does an excellent job painting the picture of how his dare i say commitment phobic thoughts appear while making you understand from the outside that these thoughts are still not especially fair to others despite nate's frequent rationalizations to himself about how fair he is being you can see how he's setting hannah up to do the things she does and how he exaggerates every emotion into irrational anger and manipulation of him but you can also see how nate has come to view tears as manipulative or why he feels like he can't ever turn down sex the female characters are not fully formed and i think that's deliberate the way that hannah and elisa are used as vehicles for nate's projections onto them is sort of parallel to how they themselves become more passive with him and how he views them more or less only in relation to himself and their reactions to him waldman also includes some intriguing ruminations on latte liberalism and the intellectual narcissism of nate and his friends greer is sort of the counterpoint but gets little airtime view spoiler i think ultimately this is why that relationship works it is completely superficial and nate does not have to feel like his inner self is being manipulated or made to change in any way essentially he doesn't have to deal with the consequences of any deep feeling hide spoiler definitely worth the read","291":"no just no i'm a third of the way through the book and still waiting for the story to begin way too much exposition and not enough in the moment action or conflict or anything style wise the prose itself was good but the snail's pace of the story totally killed this for me i abandoned this book after 75 pages","292":"i hated this book and had a hard time finishing it it spoke to a young cocky guy's entitlement and offensive attitudes towards wen painful there was nothing likable about nathaniel","293":"nathaniel p could be one of the most awful men ever but this is an excellent book lots of big words https katieboe wordpress com 2014 0","294":"the main character is insufferable which is kind of the point of the book but the downside is that i didn't want to spend any more time with him than absolutely necessary","295":"when i first started reading adelle waldman's debut novel the love affairs of nathaniel p my first thoughts were that this is sex in the city from a male perspective to some extent my first impressions weren't far off that is not to say this isn't a great novel if you want a modern novel about the dating world then this is the one for you nate piven is a brooklynite about to blast into the literary scene that is to say his novel is about to be published and in his circles that is all that matters the love affairs of nathaniel p is a study into the dating life of you guessed it nate piven he is a pretentious misogynist asshole with a terrible track record when it comes to women nate suddenly finds himself with options his gorgeous ex girlfriend a business reporter and a smart intelligent nice girl you can probably guess how this novel plays out waldman's plot is far from perfect and sometimes predicable but that is not the reason to read her book in the first place the novel is an exploration into the modern dating world as well as a glimpse into the new york literary scene adelle waldman does an amazing job exploring the dating scene and the modern man she gets the male voice almost perfect a little cliched but maybe that is just how man are i can't help but get frustrated at nate i found myself wanting to yell \"use your words\" at the page multiple times it can be infuriating to see all the stupid mistakes he keeps making but the journey makes for a great novel i don't want to be picky but the characters in the love affairs of nathaniel p were predominantly white and that felt like a bit of a problem i always think of new york city as a diverse city the literary world may not be as diverse but there is diversity in it however this felt more like the tv representation of new york in fact this novel felt so much like it was written in the hopes that it could be converted into a tv show or movie i almost expected there to be a 'token black guy' i don't think it would have taken much effort to add some diversity into the novel i would have been happy if they mentioned one character being african american asian american or anything just to add a touch of multiculturalism into the book i don't know why i care about the diversity in this novel more than others i think i enjoyed it so much i was just looking for flaws reading about the dating life of nate you get a sense of his psychology his attitude towards women his complicated relationship with his parents his fear of commitment and his complacency in a relationship it all felt so real the kind of thoughts that i remember having when i was younger the modern men's struggles to get their lives together the love affairs of nathaniel p seemed to really get this right despite the flaws in the novel i was really impressed adelle waldman's debut novel really got the modern dating world right well i'm old and married now but it was how i imagine it would be like out there for a single person nate's friend aurit's got it right \"we might as well be on fucking sex and the city\" i'm sure a younger person might compare this novel to something like girls but if you are looking for a novel about dating you should check out the love affairs of nathaniel p i especially enjoyed all the bookish conversations in this novel which always makes a novel better this review originally appeared on my blog http literary exploration com 2014","296":"i know that this book got great reviews and that it is well written but i did not find it particularly interesting to read so i am giving it an average rating","297":" very ordinary book about rather ordinary people in brooklyn who live their ordinary lives day in day out they fall in and out of love and wonder how to manage their relationships some are married and happy some are not some are single and happy some are not there is much to much relationship hassle talk and complaining to make the book really interesting and reading on seems a bit voyeuristic so i don't quite get the hype the love affairs of nathaniel p an excessively promising title alas the promise isn't kept reminds me of sex in the city next generation and the protagonist is not a bunch if urbanite girls but a kind of helpless hopeless self enamored guy named nate from suburbia not bad but nothing to write home about as my grandma used to say","298":"it may have been a best seller but this book is also rather depressing and predictable","299":"brutally honest deconstruction of relationships from a man's point of view written by a female author talented newcomer adelle waldman","300":"the world does not need another book about a pretentious literary young man trying to get laid in new york","301":"so according the fulsome praise on the book's dust jacket adelle waldman is an incisive social commentator who has exploded the world of dating in today's brooklyn and plumbed the depth of sensitive literary man's ego etc etc etc one particularly adoring reviewer goes as far as to compare her to jane austen which is not how i felt about this book look its fine actually its pretty readable engaging at times it borders on laugh out loud funny i whirled my way through this book and to give walman her credit she's a good writer waldman has some interesting things to say about how men and women behave in relationships and i'm willing to skip over the lengthy sections in which the main character muses on the intellectual inferiority of women because i'm pretty sure these were sections where the author felt she was being particularly edgy and deliberately trying to bait humourless feminists nope i'm totally willing to accept that your self involved self proclaimed postfeminist protagonist secretly does not actually respect women it seems entirely in keeping with his character mostly i just don't know how many more novels about bored privileged upper middle class ivy educated white people who have romantic problems i need to read the fact that nate feels guilt about his own easy life that he himself questions whether he should be so entirely devoted to dissecting the minutae of his own life instead of actually participating in improving himself or the world doesn't stop me as a reader also finding him tedious i mean throughout my english literature degree i used to get annoyed at people who said they didn't like the book because they couldn't relate to the main character but to be honest it wasn't even that i particularly disliked nate if only but just that he was such a thoroughly perfect example of such an utterly boring type of person that by the end of the novel i just felt vaguely bored this isn't particularly aided by the fact that the plot is pretty flimsy and nothing ever feels massively at stake in either material or emotional terms the novel takes us through a series of social engagements where nate makes the kind of banal observations beloved of columnists everywhere brunch is annoying i hate gentrification of my previously ethnic neighbourhood even though i am self evidently a part of the problem and nothing happens and nothing changes ultimately i do not care a jot whether nate will end up with cardboard cutout a or b or blissfully on his own contemplating his own literary genius","302":"couldn't even finish it so boring way too much internal dialog i have zero interest in finding out what happens to anyone i've encountered","303":" adelle waldman's debut novel is about a particular type of guy that many women will surely recognize an overeducated underemployed manchild who can't quite seem to grow up even as success is knocking at the door of his squalid walk up he's a serial monogamist stubbornly unable to commit to an adult relationship between equals yet somehow he's not exactly a bad guy...or anything if you're a fan of sex and the city you may recall that of all the lotharios and ladies men that carrie dated it was the schlubby self effacing writer berger who broke up with her in the most humiliating way on a post it note and nate waldman's protagonist is cut from precisely the same mold the story is told through his point of view so we get a glimpse into his mindset his history with women and how he perceives his own eligibility or lack thereof relative to the other men in his social circle believe me this guy does not see himself as a player by any stretch yet somehow this doesn't stop him from leaving a string of extremely pissed off broken hearted women in his wake but the love affairs of nathaniel p is actually about more than just one man's trouble with commitment and the key can be found in a conversation that takes place early in the book nate attends a dinner party with members of the brooklyn hipster literati hosted by one of his many ex girlfriends when asked what he's currently working on nate describes a piece about the american habit of outsourcing cheap labor which incites a debate about how the liberal elite are willing to pay more at a store like whole foods for the privilege of feeling ethically pure nate's thesis is that ...conscience is the ultimate luxury and it's something he certainly affords himself when justifying his treatment of the women in his life and i think this is the universal theme at the very heart of waldman's tale after all everyone finds ways of excusing their own bad behavior in order to live with themselves this is a fast entertaining read the writing is sharp and funny the characters are challenging hyper literate and full of barbed wit if you are a fan of woody allen whit stillman noah baumbach or hbo's comedy girls you're sure to find something to like in the love affairs of nathaniel p","304":" i'm wavering between a 3 and a 4 on this book a 4 because it was very well written adelle waldman has a gift for placing you inside the mind of her character almost eerily so i felt like i had to like nate at least somewhat even though from my perspective as a woman his complete lack of responsibility to partake in a relationship was cruel and almost awesomely narcissistic what saved him from complete narcissism was his redeemable ability for introspection and acceptance that at times he truly was an ass yet that very introspection felt self indulgent and never propelled him forward it was more like a luxuriant waddle in a warm mud bath so now you know why i wanted to give this a three nate's character was likable yet repellant i'm sure he's representative of his social group and it's just plain sad to me judging from my own middle class existence but i will certainly read the next waldman book selfishly i hope her undeniable talent takes her down a different path","305":"was expecting this to be a frivolous read i liked it but it made me so angry","306":"love it every 20 something girl should read it hit a chord","307":"i read it in fits and starts putting it down whenever the nate character was making me angry which was often i know protagonists don't have to be likeable and i appreciated waldman stepping into the mind of a quasi narcissist whose subconscious seems to be hung up on the lives of manly men writers like mailer that said i found the last third of the book unsatisfying and i'm not sure why waldman centred it on his relationship with his seemingly insignificant girlfriend","308":"if you've ever dated an asshole you should definitely read this incisive engaging and entirely unsettling book if you've never dated an asshole let's talk i need tips","309":"nothing too exciting but easy to read smartly written i was conflicted by my feelings for the main character throughout the story was hoping to just love him in the end","310":"fun and quick read not too much substance but enjoyable and hard to get away from","311":"i love everything about this book the characters the story the pacing the structure the writing style the vocabulary this book is profoundly insightful and entertaining i love this book for so many reasons through these characters i gained so much insight into relationships and was surprised to realise how much i had in common with nate and hannah i also love this book because it makes me aspire to be a better writer","312":"really enjoyable and insightful into the mind of a man ultimately a little unsatisfied","313":"so many feelings","314":" at first i thought this was kind of witty it was like perpetually single seinfeld in the form of a novel nate is a successful young white guy harvard grad with a book deal living in brooklyn he dates he has relationships but they don't last after the first few chapters i got tired of trying to keep track of all nate's ex girlfriends crushes and one night stands because i realized they were not germane to the story actually it turns out nothing in the book is germane it's like listening to somebody go on and on and on forever about their love life with no capacity to make it entertaining or interesting before reading this book i didn't understand the animosity against literary intellectuals in their ivory towers but thanks to adelle waldman now i can see what's so awful about peurile self indulgent navel gazing bores so at least there's that","315":"the main character was infuriating but i kept wanting to read on it was a quick read and i would give this author another read","316":"still not sure what to make of this so obsessed with getting everything right which it does that it's like one long diagnosis","317":"this book was recommended by one of my patron's he mentioned that the author really had a knack for getting inside a man's mind what a revelation","318":" theoretically this book warrants four stars it was well written thought provoking humorous in a bleak way gave a nuanced view albeit one that i didn't like of relationships and was filled with what you felt were sad truths it was also self indulgent likely intentionally so a bit too long how much of these sad truths can i handle and in the end depressing i was left feeling that there isn't much meaning to life or at least relationships i have rated it three stars the averaging of 2 and 4 stars is mathematically accurate at 3 but averages for a book review are erroneous","319":"book club december 2013 i was fascinated by this book i kept hoping to see nate sprout some insight and self awareness but nope nate is a self absorbed narcissistic arrogant elitist ass how to rate a book that you couldn't put down but wanted to chuck across the room also reminded me of the npr interview i heard for confessions of a sociopath a life spent hiding in plain sight","320":"a very humorous and well written novel with a hint of smart irony and acute observation of love affairs","321":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the love affairs of nathaniel p centers around

and maturity made it difficult for me to sympathize the love affairs of nathaniel p centers around nathaniel or nate as he is called throughout the book a thirty something son of romanian immigrants writer living in brooklyn new york the entire book focuses on nate's love life his past relationships his experience with one night stands his current girlfriend and his struggle trying to figure out what is right for him concerning love affairs and a struggle it is nate's lack of depth and maturity made it difficult for me to sympathize with him from the start the book offers the reader a very north american view on dating difficulty talking about sex having very high expectations of each other imbalance between women and men practically living together from the start of a new relationship your place or mine tonight the guy is in his thirties while his behavior and the behavior of his friends reminds me more of that of high school students nate is extremely self absorbed dishonest has no way of how to deal with his own feelings and is basically a negative person who needs to be entertained by others there was only one character that i actually liked in the book which was aurit nate's smart sharp funny friend who's views on dating differ highly from those of nate himself because i can not relate to his way of life or love the book didn't do much for me at the end what became apparent was that nate had at least some self reflective capacity although not enough to figure out yet what was really good for him mainly i think he is insecure and feels the pressure to fit in too strongly quite a shame the characters are well described though not likable the story itself is a bit predictable and the fact that nate barely grows as human is disappointing there were however some strong dialogues that made me laugh out loud however as a whole the book is not beautifully written also reading this book helped me see love and dating from a different angle and made me thing about how this subject is very much related to country and culture more","322":"almost every character in this book is a narcissistic asshole and yesterday after walking around in the consciousness of so many narcissistic assholes i began to feel like one too which seemed to be the author's point you become what you consume and soon you start to eschew anything that challenges your already narrow worldview","323":"this is getting more and more interesting http www vanityfair com style featu #http keithgessen tumblr com http www emilymagazine com http gawker com 313597 an n%252b1 p http www boston com bostonglobe ide","324":"i really enjoyed this book it's light hearted insightful and doesn't take itself too seriously also rings very true with how relationships begin and end","325":" as a young single woman dating in new york this book made me pretty angry if only because it often felt so accurate i have dated nathaniel p many many times i have however infrequently at times also been nathaniel which wasn't a thrilling realization waldman has clearly dated in new york city because it's unique to itself and to get that close to the experience i would have to believe she's undergone this insanity herself i'm not sure that this book would be as interesting to anyone outside of nyc who isn't dating but if you want a book to fuel the dating angst this is it i'd steer clear if you're getting discouraged about dating in the big city though this will definitely not make you feel any better","326":"the minutae of nate's love affairs in the setting of the brooklyn literary scene weren't enough to keep me interested i powered through and finished but was disappointed","327":"no one in my book club liked this book at all but i loved it in fact it may be the best thing i've read all summer now i want more of my friends to read it because i want to lure someone over to my side","328":"boy oh boy there are some scathing reviews of this book some people really hated it i think they mainly hated the main character and what he represented he's the male version of samantha from 'sex and the city' only less fashionable i don't know i like it i thought it was an honest and insightful look at dating in your 30's from a male perspective like it or not it's probably accurate","329":"an excellent book and very thought provoking the main character is insufferable but so well drawn that i was compelled to wish the best for him even while wanting to punch him quite hard in the face some incredibly in depth character work well worth the read","330":"a polarizing book among club members the average score was closer to 3 68 stars","331":"this was one of the most buzzed about novels of 2013 however since i'm neither a buyer of hardcovers nor an e book reader i just got around to it following the paperback release unfortunately i think in this case the hype exceeds the end result nate piven 30 year old brooklynite is an up and coming author and the bulk of this book tracks a five month period of his life during which he meets casually dates and then breaks up with a fellow writer named hannah having been a single guy in new york fairly recently i can say that i think this book fairly accurately chronicles the current dating scene here that said it gets a lot wrong too imo particularly the ending more to the point neither the events chronicled herein nor the writing itself is particularly memorable i think the reason it was paid so much attention is because the story is told from a man's perspective yet the book was written by a woman again i think it's a fairly faithful account of what a guy thinks but who cares about that when his thoughts are more banal than profound","332":"i'm rather tired of the trend in fiction for completely unlikable protagonists","333":"how does a conceited jerk from harvard seek love or sex from among his late 20 something early thirty something desperate female friends what happens when he lurches unredeemed from one anguished ivy league emotional train wreck to another amidst new york's literary publishing scene if these questions obsess you then nat is the guy and this is the book for you flashes of brilliant writing and inner dialogue combined with a sputtering and occasionally uncertain character arc","334":" i thought this book was a fascinating character study initially i sympathized with nate and thought his intentions were good though his actions might not be perceived that way as the book went on i was disappointed both by nate's narcissism and by his passivity the paradox between nate's obsession with his own thoughts and feelings and his complete inability to see or care about how he affects others is striking nate congratulates himself on his intellectual depth but certainly he is emotionally shallow overall waldman's portrait of nate was crystal clear and felt very real to me","335":"well written but there are times the internal musings of the main character male twenty something harvard grad aspiring writer in ny are redundant and kind of boring","336":"good prose and well developed characters still i just couldn't enter the protagonist's experience enough to care such endless navel gazing seems characteristic of the present generation of 20 and 30 somethings i simply don't have much patience for reading about all that interiority","337":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here with the major plot event of this story being a breakup reading this book was like watching a car crash in that way it was riveting but it left me feeling empty nate's rebound relationship with greer felt hurried and did not provide adequate resolution to his breakup with hannah i think the author casts nate in a light that is too forgiving at times his indecisiveness and self absorption are awful but he does demonstrate in a high level of self awareness the story of his fling with julie with the major plot event of this story being a breakup reading this book was like watching a car crash in that way it was riveting but it left me feeling empty nate's rebound relationship with greer felt hurried and did not provide adequate resolution to his breakup with hannah i think the author casts nate in a light that is too forgiving at times his indecisiveness and self absorption are awful but he does demonstrate in a high level of self awareness the story of his fling with juliet encapsulates this dichotomy the reader is at once impressed by his maturity and sympathy in the face of a really difficult situation he knows how difficult it must be for her and makes all the requisite statements about being supportive but he also just wants to bounce and ultimately does so nate wins points for being a man of the millennium one who is caring and lives within social norms that are more supportive of women but his selfishness triumphs in the end more","338":" there are more fiction books centered around writers than wwii so i would expect this book centered around a writer in nyc to have something to make it worth reading i was wrong not only was waldman's attempt at writing in the narrative of a man egregious her overall pretentious attitude about how great writers are was overwhelmingly obnoxious i won't waste more of my time going in to details but i will note to the author that the writing would have benefitted from both fewer verbs and fewer esoteric words there is one scene in which nathaniel p is trying to explain how successful he is to a former hs classmate and he just can't get his message across this was actually great because it was humbling to consider how your status within and outside of your work peer group are vastly different","339":"i enjoyed this book with a sort of morbid fascination take the brooklyn setting and the ivy league literati scene switch them out for a much more downmarket local equivalent and these are the men i encounter in the dating world every single day self absorbed terrified of commitment claiming and believing to value certain qualities in women and relationships but unable to sustain their self delusion for very long nate is convinced that his permanent sense of guilt and childhood status as a nerdish outlier are indications of a sensitive soul but really he's the typical nice guy with an oversized sense of entitlement willing to put long hours into working through abstract intellectual arguments but stubbornly refusing to examine his feelings closely enough to develop any real self awareness he realizes deep down that he behaves a douchebag but doesn't like the way that realization makes him feel so he rationalizes his way out of it through complex mental gymnastics that always absolve his actions in the end he treats women poorly but he feels really bad about it which must make him fundamentally okay right i'd bet anything he's a sagittarius i'm appalled that some reviews suggest that the final relationship in the book is somehow indicative of growth on his part into someone who can sustain an emotionally real pairing since to me it's clearly fueled by sexual attraction tinged with contempt the perfect misogynistic mix to me this book is a darkly cynical yet very realistic look at modern day social dynamics it's not a pretty picture but it's perversely satisfying to know at least that i'm not the only one struggling to navigate this world","340":"makes me wonder if guys really go through this thought process when dating how much is fictional and how much is accurate","341":"i'm torn on how i feel about this book on the one hand i abhorred the protagonist pretty much all the way through which i thought was strange because i've never hated a main character before although theo from the goldfinch comes to mind but only near the end as the book dragged on on the other hand i could not stop reading it as i actually enjoyed the writing and i guess i was hoping that nate would somehow redeem himself in the end it's unfortunate but i can see nate in a lot of guys i know and as for the women in this book i hate to say that i could totally relate to hannah how she felt what she had to deal with what she chose to deal with i can also understand why people would find these characters disparaging and sexist in some way because at the bare bones some of them seem like typical versions of men and women that you would see in a typical rom com at the same time i feel like there's some truth to it otherwise it wouldn't resonate with anyone who has read it overall i think it was written well although it did seem pretentious at times i suppose though that reflects how the literary world works as for a contemporary story on love and dating in a big city though i do think the author captured it well","342":"for me this novel entertainingly illustrates the impossibility of abiding by that old proverb about removing the plank in your eye before judging the speck in your neighbor's","343":"i hate this book pretentious annoying and worst of all pretty boring i was hoping to get a few good sex scenes and was thoroughly disappointed i suppose it's an accurate representation of some hipsters young adults in manhattan brooklyn who have gone to ivy league schools either way did not enjoy this novel","344":"well written and very hard to put down after awhile but only three stars because of the profound stomach turning misogyny of the main character i know that's kind of the point and i am sort of in awe at the author's ability to depict this and go deep into it but i can't say it made for a richly rewarding reading experience","345":"a young man an ivy league grad writer living in brooklyn the son of russian jewish immigrant parents finds he quickly loses interest in the smart nice women he dates and feels sort of guilty rejection does not bring out the best in the women needless to say an explication of contemporary mores i'd say not bad not wonderful","346":" i'm actually surprised at how realistic the author writes from a guy's perspective i felt like i was inside a man's mind and although i'm a girl i could completely relate to the annoying feeling hannah evokes in nate or the respect nate has for aurit i love how waldman created complex complicated characters kept in mind that humans live in the grey area the unknown the only part i really disliked was the rough patch between nate and hannah especially because hannah shouldn't have let nate act like such a jerk i was disappointed by the way the book ended and realised a bulk of it is all about the awkward and messed up relationship between nate and hannah i wouldn't read it again","347":"perfect val day read for my current state of mind no but really frighteningly accurate","348":"i get the premise and statement this book is trying to make in the end i found it so irritating and hard to read the last few chapters i really had to skim just to get to the end it was a bit tormenting so i can say that i did not enjoy this but i did technically finish it","349":"i rarely give books one star but i haaaated this one i'm all for small novels without much plot or action but this there was just nothing there the writing seemed so pedestrian and unremarkable and if there's no real plot there writing needs to really hold its own the characters so unlikable and unlikable in such boring ways i don't mind unlikable characters but they need to at least be entertaining and there wasn't really anything of substance bleh","350":"wordy pretentious self important vapid racist and classist","351":"this was a terrible book full of unnecessary vocabulary it was as if the author had fun with the thesaurus in search of the most obscure synonyms the main character was very unlikeable and difficult to empathize with thus making the book difficult to finish","352":"this book made me so happy that i'm not a smug over educated tool required reading for anyone who thinks they know a really great guy but kind of a jerk this book peels away the jerk to reveal the rot beneath i had no idea the new york literary scene involved only about 9 people but they're all in here at the same parties suffering or propping up nate usually both","353":"this hit a little too close to home","354":" the fraught world of dating and relationships and the notion of choosing who we want to be with is examined here in this debut novel i quite enjoyed adelle waldman's book and often had to remind myself that it was a woman writer writing from a male writer's perspective nate wasn't always likeable but he seemed very real and some of his behaviours all too recognizable he could easily show up on an episode of the wonderful show girls and fit right in there is some very funny writing here but also the depth in the characters reveals to us that waldman is a talented new writer who is off to a promising start nick podehl as the narrator of this audiobook should also be complemented for his fine work","355":"i really enjoyed reading this book well written and sharply observed and fun for anyone who lives in or knows brooklyn it is very small however not a bad thing in and of itself but if you're looking for something with a bit more heft look elsewhere also paints a pretty grim picture of the nyc dating scene and or single men in general","356":"relationships are a confusing maze sometimes you get to the cheese and sometimes you don't nathaniel nate pivens claims he doesn't care about the cheese yet he stumbles awkwardly in and out of relationships he's thirty living in brooklyn and is a writer on the rise his social circle lines their bookshelves with works by borges sevvo and bulgakov they are the literati the striving and not so striving writers who work for publishers write for magazines and in their free time hope to become the next great novelist it's from the literati herd that nate hunts for his romantic relationships most of the women in the group are as well read as his harvard self or at least pretend to be and that's good enough for him pity is needed for the women who see nate as a catch the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman opens with a scene that equates to a chalk outline of all the relationships nate has failed at and will fail at nate's self talk is cringe worthy he describes dating as treading on women's weaknesses and dismisses their feelings when they stray from logic in the least degree he believes women like men \"were as capable of rational thought they just didn't appear to be interested in it \" children are expert rationalizers especially anytime they do something wrong like accidentally punch their brother one reason after another explains their innocent actions nate reminds me of a child he's an imaginative rationalizer when his relationships flounder he always has a logical reason that recants his bad behavior nate's the jerk with no self awareness who is also your best friend fortunately most of my male friends who used to fall into this category have changed their ways after becoming fathers of daughters karma for my friends the realization that some jerk may treat or think about their daughters the way they used to act toward women set them on the path of atonement but nate's not a daddy yet and at his rate of failed relationships may never become one his most healthy relationship with a woman is with aurit who's a platonic friend and a respected fellow writer she disembowels his rationalizations not in a therapist way but in a calling him on his bs way nate's thoughts are frustratingly too honest and simultaneously endearing which makes him hard to hate his take on dating like several of his thoughts states a quiet communal truth it's meritocracy applied to personal life but there's no accountability we submit ourselves to these intimate inspections and simultaneously inflict them on others and try to keep our psyches intact - to keep from becoming cold and callous - and we hope that at the end of it we wind up happier than our grandparents who didn't spend this vast period of their lives these prime years so thoroughly alone cold and explicitly anatomized again and again it's these kind of thoughts that smooth nate's mildly misogynist edge and uncloaks his insecurities the psychic walk through nate's brain reveals that he's spent most of his life on the fringe of popularity the upcoming publishing of his book has ameliorated his popularity with women and within the literati but most of his memories echo a sadness that stems from not always understanding social mores and from his deep desire to fit in his frequent reference to his parents' immigrant status hints at the duality of identity that children of immigrants often express as a result of straddling two cultures - one at home a different one at school i rated the book four out of five stars on goodreads the writing is excellent and has a siren quality to it the rating is also supported by my being fooled i was convinced that the story was written by a man until my finger swiped to the author bio i like stories that expose fissures in my assumptions about myself and the world the fact that waldman is a woman erupted my belief that i was mature enough to not buy into the mars versus venus argument apparently i'm the mental age of a thirteen year old am i a sexist most of my life the male species has surrounded me i have three brothers no sisters my cousins are mostly male i spent twelve years working in the male dominated tech field i've been so thoroughly schooled in the male world that when i birthed a son a dear friend responded \"thank goodness what would you do with a girl \" she wasn't being sarcastic if it wasn't for being in a sorority in college i may have never applied mascara or learned how to balance a checkbook if a guy had written the book my guilt wouldn't be so heavy i've been married for over a decade and never questioned that my husband would want anything different from our relationship than what i do - love and support i couldn't imagine him ever having the thoughts that nate does yet i easily found the thoughts believable of any other guy believing in nate's character is like thinking that every packet of sugar but the one you're eating tastes sour so i'll dismiss my sexist lapse by taking the nate way out and rationalize waldman's debut is an incredible study of character not only of nate but almost everyone nate comes into contact with as nate delves into his past or examines his current girlfriends each word pieces pixels together into a detailed image of a person each person's description in turn further builds nate's character the rationalization is that nate was very believable so much so that by the end of the novel i knew enough about nate to cringe again when his thoughts foreshadowed one more potential plunge off the failed relationship cliff pick the love affairs of nathaniel p up or download it it's a fast enjoyable read","357":"is it a 2 is it a 3 maybe just not for this reader plus c'mon love affairs i may have been expecting more non loser dude commentary","358":"i liked this while i was reading it but it hasn't really stuck in my memory basically about a guy in new york and his various girlfriends probably would make more sense to people who live in new york","359":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the book itself was great the writing was really descriptive the characters were really good representations of a certain type i thought i listened to it on audio and i hated the reader he made every woman's voice whiny which made me dislike all of them automatically and made me dislike the reader for portraying women as whiny the characters were almost all insufferable assholes i absolutely hated nate i hated greer and elisa and i was annoyed at hannah this book describes men's tho the book itself was great the writing was really descriptive the characters were really good representations of a certain type i thought i listened to it on audio and i hated the reader he made every woman's voice whiny which made me dislike all of them automatically and made me dislike the reader for portraying women as whiny the characters were almost all insufferable assholes i absolutely hated nate i hated greer and elisa and i was annoyed at hannah this book describes men's thoughts about women and relationships but since the author is a woman i wonder whether she polled her male acquaintances or just used what she believed because she paints men in a pretty poor light but honestly she doesn't do the women any favors either and in the end yet another man chooses a weaker less intelligent woman over the smart witty one so i'm not really sure what message i was supposed to get out of this book more","360":"pheh it was well written that's for sure but i found nate to be a little whiny but maybe that was the point but it was well written","361":"a razor sharp searing account of the internal life of the sad young literary man that i've had the misfortune of being hannah to a few too many times quite wonderful but to say that certain pages left me breathless would be nothing short of a gross understatement 3 5","362":"lena dunham once tweeted don't you wish you could get everyone you have mild awkwardness with into one room and just hash it out so the streets can be safe again for nathaniel p the streets are rarely safe every train platform coffee shop literary party and dive bar in nate's gentrifying corner of brooklyn is a way station where his scorned lovers await an opportunity to halfheartedly air their grievances and so begins the love affairs of nathaniel p nate runs into a woman who had his abortion a year ago who he hasn't contacted since on the way to an ex's party where he meets his next girlfriend the relationship that follows is painstakingly detailed there has been much debate in recent years about likable and unlikable characters in fiction nate is extremely unlikable he's narcissistic and judgmental and pats himself on the back for his liberal guilt he sees himself as a pretty decent guy and he is in comparison to his douchey comrades waldman gives us his backstory about a time before harvard when the girls in his jewish day school had no appreciation for his vast intelligence and even the years after harvard when he was writing his novel and not yet a rising literary star this helps give cause to his transformation from a literary wallflower to the guy who never called although i found myself hating so many of his thoughts and perceptions waldman shows us that it is not likability that's interesting it's believability the portrait she paints is so realistic and well drawn that i enjoyed spending time with the asshole she created like i would a pompous acquaintance so many young women in brooklyn are confused by these shaggy haired intellectuals who they see as below them on the totem pole but give them a chance because they admire their politics and love of literature and are then devastated when they are dumped or ignored waldman convincingly explains this phenomenon through nate and the impact this behavior has on the self esteem of women who exist in a shallow pool of viable options she shows us how once the tides have inexplicably turned there is nothing a woman can do to win these people back while highly relatable to anyone who has traveled in these circles in new york this novel may be hard to swallow for people unfamiliar with this landscape however i think most people would appreciate her unsentimental portrayal of falling in and out of love","363":"i'm always weary of authors who write in the voice of the opposite sex with such authority but after reading i'm convinced she got this guy right and not just him but the relationships too well the relationships of entitled 30 somethings living in brooklyn anyway hugely satisfying for a book that really doesn't have a plot to speak of","364":"i think if i'd read this 10 years ago i might have been more charmed by the protagonist but he just comes across as a privileged selfish man child incapable of maintaining intimate bonds his suspended adolescence and grand sense of self make it difficult to care about him or anyone with whom he comes into close contact the book is well written though and i look forward to reading future work from waldman","365":"i agree that nathaniel p is a self absorbed twit i wonder do all young men think like this about their relationships the guy is obsessed i am glad i read it though","366":"smart and funny writing style it's amazing how a woman writer is able to place herself so convincingly in a man's shoes the main character is relatable and walks the line between likable and insensitive very enjoyable read","367":"i thought the narrative style was witty and quick paced but the book felt like a woman's revenge on the men who made her crazy i'm not saying men don't think behave this way but there i felt like the portrayal had an air of dis ingenuousness","368":" i was very surprised by how much i liked this book it would be easy to brush it off as a frivolous book about dating but it is so intelligently and precisely written that you simply can't i found the author's vocabulary voluminous but not pretentiously employed and her eye for detail and in depth character development is excellent there is a scene in which nate is discussing his relationships with a female friend and he challenges the subject of dating as being girl stuff his friend disagrees smartly defending the subject as extremely important and not shallow dating is probably the most fraught human interaction there is i think her argument could be viewed as a defense for this book as a whole if you were to explain the book's subject to someone who hadn't yet read it it might sound like a trite fluff of a novel but it's actually quite deeply considered material i also thoroughly enjoyed the literary conversations that nate and his friends who all work as writers or in publishing have about books philosophy and ethics written by a less capable writer these characters' thoughts could have come off as sophomoric but their perspectives were always intriguing insightful and amusing in addition to those who want an intelligent book about modern dating i also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys light philosophical debate or literary allusion additionally this was a personally compelling read for me because there are a lot of books and tv shows set in gentrified brooklyn but never has a book so precisely reflected the day to day of that world as i see and experience it as someone who lives in that world this is not the oblivious self centered privileged realm of sloane crosley or amy sohn these are characters who are privileged in that they are for the most part white middle class intelligent and well educated but they are well aware of this privilege and constantly concerned with the guilt and responsibility that comes with it there are several passages where nate reflects on his position in life and questions why he was lucky enough to have been born into these circumstances instead of someone else nate and his friends are far from perfect people but they seem to be living their lives not with a blind feeling of deserving their position but instead with questioning reflection on the world and their place in it pursuing happiness conscientiously","369":"the invention of the intellectual is the closest thing to a national sport in american letters also these people don't even do drugs","370":"quick read about a self involved pretentious serial monogamist nate and the slew of women he wreaks havoc upon the story is told from nate's unlikable point of view which ends up keeping the reader at an unemotional distance certainly kept me thinking long after i finished it but it was a bit too clever to really pull me in","371":"really hard to get through the only positive is that it's shorter than most books i read if it was longer i wouldn't have made it","372":"i wanted to like this book but i just... didn't i gave it 150 pages and then wondered why i was still reading the characters all seemed pretty one note and that one note was unlikeable and what little plot existed tended to be obscured by the author's philosophical musings i think the author is a talented writer and certainly there were beautiful passages but i need more than beautiful writing to keep me reading i need there to be complex characters and an interesting plot","373":" i know this book has taken some heat for focusing so minutely on the problems of a privileged brooklyn writer hipster and for a woman writing it in a man's voice but wow it is hard for me to think of a character about whom i have swung so often and so violently between sympathy and frustration understanding and anger she really takes you inside the mind of this guy who cannot shut his brain down and it is painful watch him over thinking himself out of another normal relationship ultimately he does some things that are pretty unforgivable but you can almost understand why","374":"engaging engrossing and well written i despised the main character and i'm still not sure i was supposed to hence the missing fifth star","375":"equal parts irritating and entertaining perfect beach read","376":"super interesting look into the dating game from the male point of few","377":"i found myself laughing during various parts of this book when situations that seem all too familiar arose it was entertaining and a quick read but ultimately lacking any real substance what am i supposed to believe after reading this book about relationships that i didn't already know","378":"it was good in how it makes ones despise the main character and the people around him as a reflection of a far too common type of people found in our society young adults hiding their superficiality under a sense of intellectual hipsterized superiority an apt description of child men who don't know what to do about the fact that they are suddenly adults nor about the women who stupidly pursue them despite knowing full well how they'll just end up feeling used empty and sad","379":"i'm reading the incredibly smart and amusing the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman--it's one of those books in which the main character's self is just laid bare his insecurities attractions snobberies and strivings everything else in his world is observed just as closely with that cool awareness that suggests a narrative voice sitting in the corner of the bar swirling its drink and eyeing everyone's rather desperate zigzags around the room","380":" a rare bad review for me i can find something in most of what i read that i enjoy not this one it's not badly written but there wasn't much i found either enlightening or enjoyable she's written a book about a jerk intellectual and the women who let him into their lives she seems to hate her characters and the city u0026amp time they live in i'm assuming benjamin kunkle gave it a good blurb because he basically wrote the same book a few years ago go read kevin seccia's review i mean the same thing not recommended unless you've just been dumped by a jerk","381":" this book offers a wonderfully insightful view into the the intellectual literary subculture of brooklyn however the more interesting view we obtain is that of a male in his 30s on the cusp of literary fame a guy who espouses all the requisite feminist views yet a guy who is emotionally abusive and who acknowledges his hard ons when fighting with one long time girlfriend and the secret thrill he derives from calling another a stupid cunt both men and women will recognize in themselves nate's way of growing bored in a relationship his passive aggressive way of refusing to talk about problems his way of having another woman lined up as he exits a relationship however when we finally reach the point of the book where nate's abusiveness really starts to stand out many readers may recognize him as a current and or former significant other i noticed throughout the book that nate is awful in bed and i sighed thinking maybe the author would never point this out but she did in a relatively amusing way and nate still refused to believe it nate's friend aurit has one of the best descriptions of a particularly abusive relationship she'd described her parents' fucked up dynamic how her father's response to any criticism was 'if you don't like it leave ' aurit argued that for the person with more power in a relationship to refuse to take seriously the unhappiness of the other simply because nothing is forcing them to is the ultimate dick move","382":"every girl in nyc or sf and probably la has dated the guy in this book at least once obsessed with prestige and making up for high school and college insecurities nate is taking advantage of his new found literary and sexual success by just being the worst he just doesn't get that he doesn't get it when it comes to women written by a woman this book very easily could have made nate completely unlikeable but he is rounded out somewhat by his group of friends one is even a strong woman and his background as a first generation american who feels distant from his parents","383":"at times really hard to read given the subject matter and deep sense of oh fuck i've dated this guy great character study although i really waffled on whether i thought he was a sociopath or just a dude in his early 30s in new york","384":"surprisingly enjoyed this book","385":"i've lived every moment of this book from both sides and just thinking about it makes me cringe on a cellular level the evolution of nate's relationship with hannah is the stuff of pure horror the kind of shit that keeps you up at night that makes you shake your fists at the sky and scream what is this life that said it's funny and mostly well written","386":"nathaniel p's inner monologue is pretty annoying","387":"oh nate you are pathetic i'm sorry i wasted several hours inside your head","388":"this book got amazing reviews by everyone the sentences are well constructed but that is about where my positive review ends i found it pedantic and self indulgent what can i say","389":" 2 5 stars as the title suggests this book is about nathaniel p and his love affairs nate is a harvard educated writer living in brooklyn in the midst of a burgeoning literary scene he is smart but self absorbed lacking empathy and generally just a class a jerk the reader spends the book inside his head as he becomes involved with a number of women so we learn what he thinks about the various women he dates and it's usually not pleasant i disliked the book i felt like i was reading trashy book but with really good writing i get that she was trying make some intelligent commentary of sexism and modern relationships but the commentary felt overly simplistic and so stereotyped that it weakened the message for me nate was so simplistically dislikable that he did not feel believable to me as the representation of the modern male intellectual i did like the numerous literary references and was amused by some of the conversation between nate and his friends i also felt like it did capture some elements of the new york literary scene fairly well","390":"i loved this book i was completely enamored with nate and thought that the author did a fantastic job of making me simultaneously hate him and sympathize with him it's just such a frank and honest description of what dating is like when your roughly 30 the want and need to be in a relationship and the want and need to have space and be independent both from the female and male perspective seriously loved this book","391":"you probably should hate nathaniel but he's so easy to hate you almost shouldn't hate him the book is a piercing character study of a a certain sort of milieu one that would be tolerable to be amongst only in very short spans it was easy to read witty and occasionally deep","392":"well written and props to adelle waldman for her ability to write from the male perspective so acutely but i didn't love it","393":"waldman's characters felt one dimensional and the protagonist is flat pathetic and inconsistent he was literally one of the most annoying protagonists i've ever encountered the author tries much too hard to seem intellectual and deep but she just isn't yuck","394":"oh nate great book well written and painful to read","395":"i can only give this book 2 stars for the fact it brought out such a huge amount of loathing for the main character this means the author must have written it well otherwise i wouldn't have been as invested in praying this main character would meet a horrible death","396":"absolutely loved loved loved this book adelle waldman is a genius heard her described somewhere as a present day george eliot which is very apt","397":"i find it astonishing that this book was written by a woman it felt like misogynistic prattle for 200 pages good writer colorful just a boggling book","398":"'i feel like you want to think what you're feeling is really deep like some seriously profound existential shit but to me it looks like the most tired the most average thing in the world the guy who is all interested in the woman until the very moment when it dawns on him that he has her wanting only what you can't have the affliction of shallow morons everywhere'","399":"i got halfway through this but couldn't finish it the protagonist reminded me far too much of an ex boyfriend and the book in general felt completely directionless wasn't worth wasting my time","400":"i was really looking forward to reading this book it is entirely driven by character development and it's very literary i am impressed by adelle's writing and the way she wrote the main character nate adelle's writing is so deep and true to human nature these characters are real people i would recommend this book to people who enjoy literary novels it could feel slow at first but stick with it it was an enjoyable read","401":" this may be the best book i've read this year waldman writes the history of a man in the middle of developing his sexuality as well as his literary tools and the process of growth is not an easy one nathaniel piven is very much a creature of literature and most of his friends are as well adelle waldman could easily have let this novel descend into the sitcom formula of sex and the city or friends or any number of derivative works of various forms but she keeps nate and his women within the bounds of belief and we readers learn a lot more about the male psyche and libido than we think we might nate is not perfect in any way one of his girlfriends dumps him in a long email and the ps to it closes with the judgment that \"you're really bad in bed \" ouch a sloppy lover he is devoted to his own pleasure this failing leads to his inability to sustain a relationship or even a friendship with one for very long first there's juliet then elisa the star hottie of the group but he chooses hannah to live with and eventually desiccate even though she lasts the longest and there is the old fall back reliable kirsten there are various others who haunt his memory for varying reasons and for varying periods of time but none does enough to his mind to entrap him or make him wish to be entrapped there are small things wrong from nate's perspective with each of them and he seems to spend most of his time thinking about their weaknesses rather than their strengths but clearly none has captured his whole heart that may be the problem with nate as a boyfriend and lover it's all or nothing with him women readers may wish that nate could turn off his mind and just get on with it but nate analyzes everything and the analysis is his way of proportioning his affections many of the girls that turn into his love affairs seem perfectly acceptable to the reader--they are all to one degree or another beautiful charming learned introspective and should be perfectly acceptable to mom and dad--only nate distrusts their opinions for reasons of family tradition and inability to grant his parents grace as well as his natural inclination to avoid commitment nate is not above a clever turn of phrase that always seems to hit spot on \" over time he had come to see her as overprivileged and underinteresting \" or there is this admission \"...it was not always unpleasant to deal with a hysterical woman one feels so thoroughly righteous in comparison \"one who is not thirty something or literary or good looking enough to run with the men and women in this book may be impatient at the cruelty they occasionally visit upon each other and will wince at their blunt honesty but my impression is that people of this age today are more cruel and blunter than we were i can only stand back and marvel at the depth of the feeling intellect and desire for something better that each of the characters in this fine novel exhibit waldman has set a high standard for herself and i hope she can maintain it","402":"i really wanted to like this book as i read so many good reviews about it maybe i missed a level of irony somewhere but i found the loveable antihero very difficult to like let alone love the way he approached his life and relationships was frustrating viewing people as belonging to one of two categories with any non stereotypical traits being treated as deviations from the mean rather than individual characteristics maybe this is indeed how people think and maybe this was the point of the book but i still found myself rolling my eyes at this book more than enjoying it the end almost made up for a lot of it but unfortunately the book overall was not as enjoyable as i had hoped it to be i guess reading it made me feel a little bit like dating nate made hannah feel patronised and frustrated","403":"valuable insights for hipsters in conducting love affairs","404":"it was hard to like the protagonist of this book i think it's interesting that the author is female and is able to write so well from a male perspective but i just couldn't really sympathize with nathaniel and felt like he was kind of an ass maybe i'm not cool enough to have enjoyed it i can however see this as some indie movie staring joseph gordon leavitt or something","405":"this was a bit of a hate read for me there were glimmers of the novel i wanted it to be sentences that rang true but mostly i felt that i was supposed to hate every single character","406":" i hated this book for so many reasons it's fake high brow trash for former ivy leaguers who live in brooklyn i won't even say it's a good beach read because nothing happens there is no plot and the protagonist a single guy in his 30s is so boring he's suppose to be an offensive character but he's just so bleh i also don't think waldman captured how a single man actually thinks this book was clearly written by a woman what man spends so much time analyzing his romantic relationships that is quintessential female i was annoyed the entire time i was reading this that it got so much hype and such good reviews when it is so cliched boring unmemorable and silly perhaps i should've known this book wasn't for me from the simple fact that all reviewers are saying it's the modern day pride and prejudice which is the all time worst and silliest book ever and never should have become part of the canon the anti israel anti orthodox vibe was so annoying uninspired and unoriginal the repeated use of the phrase stentorian voice gave me the creeps i almost gave this book 1 star but i added an extra one because waldman seemed like she is probably bright and i gave twilight one star and i don't think this was quite as bad as the inner monologue of an adolescent girl debating the merits of a vampire vs a werewolf","407":"while i don't disagree with many of the other reviewers' assessments of nathaniel's character i don't agree that his being a jerk made this a bad book in fact his travels in and out of jerk territory made me more interested in his fairly average love life then i thought i'd be this book is about the reality of love not the fantasy of it","408":"the fact that this book was written by a woman makes it sort of scary at times i was identifying with the thought processes of the protagonist so much that it creeped me out a little i found it a very accurate detailed and realistic account of one man's struggle with love or whatever he mistook for love at times the prose was a bit dry and i missed the immediacy of the dialog whenever the protagonist got lost in memories and justifications still i noticed a lot of people complaining about the characters in the sense that they feel a need to judge them well i think that's one of the signs that the book succeeds in its ambitions nathaniel is not an asshole he's a coward at times but that can be said of most men he definitely reminded me of some people i know on the other hand some of the pseudo intellectual conversations got a bit of hand and made me feel like i was stuck listening to a bunch of empty headed arrogant pricks again a feeling i used to experience at parties a lot haven't been to one in ages if anything it made me wonder about the world the author inhabits in real life are the characters based on her friends or acquaintances perhaps even herself or one of her former lovers adelle waldman has certainly managed to intrigue me with her debut and i look forward to her future work","409":"i hated the book at the beginning annoyed primarily by what one of the reviewers called forced pseudo intellectual conversations but ended up loving it for its most accurate description of how the doomed connections are made and follow apart and of the ways in which friendships work or do not","410":"just a really fun read sex and the city from a dude's perspective","411":"this book basically brought back memories of my pretentious college boyfriend and his friends who all went to private school at andover i could barely finish this book","412":"a pretty solid book and an interesting read i found myself and a lot of male friends agree that it can be a surprisingly representative critique of the male mind however i think the writing itself left a lot to be desired i am not a fan of her style","413":"i found this story to be choppy and boring i think it would have been more enjoyable to read if the characters had been fleshed out completely i often found myself trying harder than necessary to capture the essence or point of view of each character basically i'm still hungry for something that doesn't even taste that good","414":"when i started this book i didn't think i was going to enjoy it arrogant and incredibly judgmental harvard grad with a small circle of friends everyone of whom is either brilliant successful or both dates and dumps girls but i kept reading what is so amazing about this book was not that it's actually a great book but rather it's a brilliant and honest exploration of all the things that we think during a relationship but leave unspoken i identified with both nate and his girlfriends and kept finding myself wandering back to my past relationships finding many many parallels i don't come across very many books that compel me to dig deep and analyze my own experiences from a different perspective but that's exactly what this book did it also made me incredibly grateful to be married and to hopefully place the dating scene forever behind me i wouldn't say this book is for everyone but for those of us with a complicated dramatic or colorful history of relationships there might be some refreshing insight to be gleaned here","415":"i've never enjoyed a book so much while having such a similarly high level of loathing for the protagonist","416":" first started reading the love affairs of nathaniel p with high expectations having been told that it was a \"deep thought provoking look at relationships today \" or something along those lines and that it was \"deliciously funny \" i discovered that it did not meet my expectations and that the quotes on the back of a book are supposed to make you want to read the book the love affairs of nathaniel p is about well exactly what it sounds like the story fo the love affairs of nathaniel p ti first started reading the love affairs of nathaniel p with high expectations having been told that it was a \"deep thought provoking look at relationships today \" or something along those lines and that it was \"deliciously funny \" i discovered that it did not meet my expectations and that the quotes on the back of a book are supposed to make you want to read the book tthe love affairs of nathaniel p is about well exactly what it sounds like the story follows nathaniel a writer growing in popularity and reputation in brooklyn throughout his many romantic adventures for lack of a better word he goes through a number of girlfriends but when one relationship starts getting more serious he has to reconsider just what he wants in a relationship ti won't deny it some parts in this book truly were deep and though provoking like i was told however many of these parts also seemed to be more filler like when nate and jason are discussing meritocracy jason is talking about how \"'...meritocracy is a crueler system than what it replaced...'\" waldman 213 while this discussion is all well and good it doesn't have too much to do about love and relationships today some parts of this book were very thought provoking like advertised yet other parts were not in fact a good chunk of the book was...not appropriate for school not in the least if i wanted to read anything like that i would read 50 shades of grey i thought this was completely unnecessary and could have been done without while it is integral to the discussion and thought at some points at others it just seems unnecessary completely random and out of place and purposeless","417":"waldman has a great eye for the details of the brooklyn scene and a great ear for the dialogue of the literary and not so literary members of nate's circle my gripes 1 the characters though well drawn are not dynamic they don't change they wallow in the unsatisfying ambience they've created 2 the author must be a man hater all the men including the protagonist are misogynistic sex crazed jerks this can't be true 3 waldman's universe seems to be populated not by two genders but by two species there seem to be two sets of behavioral rules expectations and responses one for men and the other for women all of us embody some of the male and some of the female but not these characters","418":"i really wanted to like this book but couldn't stand the main character i kept reading waiting for the story to turn around but it never did","419":"infuriating in its accuracy scathing in its wit heartbreaking and despicable and un put down able waldman is a genius","420":"i wasn't a big fan of this book and it probably had to do w the unlikeable main character i thought the writing was good but i didn't understand the point of the book it wasn't altogether entertaining though there were interesting aspects to it so it wasn't just a for fun book to me main take away glad i'm not a single woman who writes for a living and resides in brooklyn so i don't have a chance of running into nate","421":"i wish i could give this more stars it's very well written which i suppose is why i kept reading it but the story isn't all that interesting an immature stereotypical new york writer treats a lot of women in stereotypical ways it's kind of a modern version of _bright lights big city_ i suppose except new york in the 10's isn't nearly as interesting as new york in the 80's and neither are its young male authors or at least that's what i get out of the book","422":"i do not know why i read this book but i did it was alright i guess","423":" oh boy did the ending of this book make me want to throw this book out the window and forget i even read it this could be the fact that i know this 'nathaniel' character and have interacted with the likes of them in my daily life nathaniel is late 20's early 30's living in nyc in what sounds like the early 2000's he is a writing that seems to think everything he emits from his being is brilliant he has opinions and finds that only topics he has opinions on are the only ones worth talking about nathaniel also doesn't like a challenge and seems to be taken aback when someone has a different point of view in this book it reviews all of nathaniel's former lovers and reasons that it didn't work out in the now of the book he is dating hannah a girl he met at a party and later via email had a spirited debate with the relationship starts off slow but he often notes that hannah isn't the girl all men lust after she is instead the girl he can bring around his friends and she can hold her own after awhile he becomes extremely unhappy because hannah challenges him and heaven forbid she doesn't stroke his ego all the time spoiler i could have lived with him and hannah parting ways but then end no instead while at the end of his relationship with hannah he runs into a girl he knows greer who is apparently petite and hot and also wrote a book about her sex capades so i mean obviously nathaniel should start dating this girl because think of all the guys who will be jealous when he walks into the party with her i mean who cares that her thoughts only skim the surface and his friends often disregard her when they have conversations because she can't hold her own i mean who needs that when you are dating this girl who is hot and occasionally throws a tantrum in the likes of a 5 year old you go nathaniel p obviously cracking the code for a lasting relationship","424":" fine readable good writing but i'm not sure why i bothered i was prepared for the fact of the annoying anti hero but this still seemed a bit pointless it was like a lesser version of the marriage plot and a far lesser version of iris murdoch's psychologically dense and morally rich novels which in bare outline are not really dissimilar characters in various combinations of intertwined unhealthy obsessive relationships who articulately and verbally obsess about their relationships and each other","425":"just fails for me book tries to be kind of indictment of young males ends up being a dry narrative about one unlikeable 30 something 2 stars because prose is not bad","426":"insightful witty and portrayal of literary hipster social circles in brooklyn i haven't come across another novel that rings as true to that particularly modern scene a smart critique of how smart 'post feminist' men with elite degrees can still be completely lousy to the women in their lives but i couldn't get past how infuriating i found nate the lack of depth to any of the female characters and how utterly unredemptive the ending is","427":"cringe worthy insights into modern dating that i had trouble putting down","428":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a well written book about a guy who is a self indulgent whiny tool three stars because i lost patience with the knucklehead and didn't finish the book","429":"i felt like there was no point to this story it was full of junk and the story went nowhere i felt like nathaniel was a static character didn't really enjoy this one","430":"i might buy this book for my nieces to help them recognize and steer clear of the nate pivens of the world","431":"nate is a writer living in brooklyn who just got a book deal he hangs out with and sometimes dates other writers in brooklyn waldman is good at capturing the nuances of nate's different relationships all the characters are believable nate and his friends know they are privileged and intellectually elite they write essays on for example commodification of conscience and they have smart discussions the writing is smart and if you can relate to these people you will enjoy this it lacks a climatic finish the end feels like a short story ending and some might say that nate is not too exciting but his story is very real and well observed","432":"i'm surprise everyone lauded this book with as many accolades as they did a quick read but not all that stimulating","433":"beautifully written totally cringe worthy depiction of a male anti hero i had to keep looking at the author portrait on the jacket to make sure it was a woman waldman writes a very convincing narrative from a male pov liked it very much","434":"this book is sort of like every bad stereotype i have about upperclass east coast ivy league school attending supposed liberals rolled into one character","435":"see kevin's review dated september 2013 below just didn't get this book at all i just wanted to smack each of these pretentious unlikeable characters i couldn't get to the end fast enough","436":"if i had read this book when i was 25 i would have loved it especially if i lived in brooklyn","437":"i'd give this 2 5 if i could rounding up because it was a quick entertaining read but overall fluff disguised as literary fiction the characters were pretentious insufferable is this really what people in the new york literary world are like i have my suspicions it's chick lit told from the dude's perspective like i said entertaining but definitely not high brow no matter how intellectual the characters think they are if that was the intent then kudos","438":"the characters in this book annoyed me all of them i found myself skimming through sections of this book i wouldn't recommend it","439":" so frustrating in its shallow but heavy handed psychological representations the characters are caricatures so obvious thinly painted but given far too much detail the author could benefit from explaining less and leaving out all the over analysis that marks this as a blatantly female read the best represented and most believably human character was greer who was woefully relegated to the final few pages that she in her sparse detail and description stands out in such contrast from the other more 'developed' characters should speak volumes the old writers' maxim show don't tell is pertinent here luckily i think the women who pick this book up will be smart enough to see through all the misogynist baiting and not use it to inform their opinions of men and 'mannishness' otherwise i'd rank it alongside 50 shades in its irresponsible representations of male female dynamics i'm left with the feeling that this novel was written for men to read for them to read and learn some kind of lesson from but it over simplifies and generalises a male psyche unfairly so in my opinion and kicks up the whole 'not all men' argument again which is reductive but essentially true and that just leaves me feeling uncomfortable and with a bitter taste","440":" i went into reading this book feeling excited because there has been some talk about this book i saw it chosen as some online magazines book group pick but have since forgotten which one it actually was even though that is truly what prompted me to pick up this novel that and comparisons between waldman and jane austen well i guess i'm here to say ms waldman has a long way to go although it wasn't a bad start either nathaniel is a writer living in brooklyn he's been struggling for years but works hard his parents romanian jewish immigrants worked hard to give him an american life and he pretty much seems to have realized that dream he attended harvard pursued a writing career and eventually moved to new york city and sold his first book glowing in that recent success nate starts to wonder why doesn't he have a girlfriend what went wrong with the old girlfriends we soon get a lot of insight into why things might not have worked out with his previous girlfriends as well as the one he meets in the course of the book i will totally admit to having a preconceived notion of what this book was going to be like and fully admit to being wrong i did not have any clue it was going to be a discourse on why no woman would never be good enough for nate's friends yes his friends because even though nate is fairly attractive in his own right who you hang out in brooklyn with is nearly of equal or possibly greater importance as far as how attractive you might be to the opposite sex nate's friends might leave a bit to be desired but with this novel everyone is a sort of caricature of themselves so the fact that we meet a very one dimensional jason who eventually does show a more sensitive side is relatively unimportant the truth is for nate it is all how the current woman looks on his arm and to his friends with nate appearances at least at the start of the novel are everything i enjoyed reading this book although at times i felt frustrated waldman tries a little too much to think like a man nate does have some pretty bad habits in his thinking and his behavior and you root for him but wish that maybe he could change just a little and learn from his mistakes definitely an interesting debut for adelle waldman","441":" this book is certainly an easy read and is full of pointed pretty spot on critiques of the new york hipster intelligentsia i'm not sure whether nate is really that realistic of a character or not having never lived inside the brain of a womanizer but he's certainly an infuriating person to spend time with and well drawn by the author i'd kind of love to get a male perspective on this book since its kind of reprehensible male protagonist is written by a woman how much does his inner monologue ring true in any case a good modern comedy of manners","442":"i can handle unlikable characters and i can handle messy not really the end endings but there still has to be something that makes the book readable unfortunately this book didn't hold my interest and i can't put my finger on why exactly maybe it's because nate wasn't only unlikable he was also pretentious and boring maybe it's because nate was the only character focused on the other characters had no depth and were only there to give nate something to react to play off of depriving us of the chance to see why they would choose to date be friends with nate at all maybe it's no reflection of the author at all and i'm merely reacting to the knowledge that there are plenty of real life nates that treat plenty of real life hannahs poorly and it makes me sad whatever the reason this book just wasn't for me and i'm ready to move on find all my reviews at http readingatrandom blogspot com 2","443":" this book was a smooth read pleasing in its true to life ness even though i'm not into dating e g i enjoy being single and fail to see why being in a relationship is seen as such an end goal accomplishment in the western culture i was really drawn to these characters who are immersed in the dating culture nate is an intelligent guy who makes questionable choices i see him not as a frustrating character but a perceptive young man coming into his own as he grapples with two opposing narratives of masculinity his own writerly sensitivities and astute awarenesses of relational signs of discontent and the cultural narrative of acquisition of a partner and objectification of the female mind and body i forgive the characters for two accounts of negative stereotypical comments about my alma mater vassar college","444":"i'm of the wrong demographic to really relate to the angst filled self absorbed 20 something new yorkers who are dealing with launching careers and finding love but it's witty and clever with some well placed barbs at the elitism and entitlement that seem to propel the main characters","445":"adelle waldman is so spot on it's painful i've heard this story many many times from the ladies' pov occasionally from the men's from my friends over innumerable cups of coffee what sticks in my craw just a little is how sympathetic she is to her caddish anti hero waldman seems to genuinely feel that it's not entirely nathaniel's fault that he cannot seem to treat a lady right we're just all adrift in today's sexual mores so even while exposing his casual sexism his deluded sense of his own needs his immaturity waldman has a seemingly never ending fund of sympathy for nate personally i got a little sick of it waldman is a careful and clear chronicler of the head and heart taking note of many stray thoughts and each emotional tremor i admire that attention to detail but i found it a bit claustrophobic still it's a rare writer who can skewer someone -- really the entire brooklyn scene -- so thoroughly without stacking the deck waldman is a straight shooter","446":"i really did not like this book too much intellectualizing and the main character had no self awareness and was a total jerk so hard for me to get drawn into the story","447":" plot 3 reminded me of a modern high fidelity my biggest problem with it was that nothing really happened to drive the book forward writing 4 well developed characters i had to use the thesaurus at least once a page which i never mind page turner 2 this was the biggest issue for me i really had a hard time wanting to pick it up again because there wasn't much of a central conflict great character study though overall 3 i recommend this and i think a single person in the city would be a better audience for it","448":"reading this book is like a sneak peek on what is going on through a man's mind with regards to commitment you'll be quite amazed how the author who by the way is a girl has captured how dating love commitment is for guys","449":" meh the protagonist and almost all the characters in this book are sort of annoying but not so annoying or even interesting that i had strong feelings about any of them the protagonist's inner monologues become increasingly wearying as the book goes on this feels like an insider y type book that might resonate more effectively with people who work in the publishing industry or people who live in brooklyn or perhaps only the venn diagram sliver of people who encompass both those things and move in the same sort of creative circles as the people in this book i'm sure these characters are realistic and the portrayal of life in nyc literary circles seems right but who cares i assume the novel is meant to offer an implicit social critique of or at least a social reflection on the narcissists it portrays but the world of this novel is simply too specific and narrowly drawn for me to discern any broader takeaways","450":"well written pretty douchey characters and takes on life couldn't necessarily tell if the author wanted this depiction to be a critique or just a snapshot of how she thinks life is all the same nicely written with it's self congratulatory air","451":" this book is not for the faint of heart the ending left much to be desired but such is life we don't always get these incredible moments of stark epiphany that wrap up our lives in neat little bows i appreciated the honesty and authenticity it was so easy for myself as a reader to identify with despite the main character being a male and i a female there were so many times i caught myself rooting for nate in one instance and cursing him in the next that makes a story great and i believe that makes for a great in betweener book meaning the book won't necessarily impact your life in any definitive way except say in day to day recognition of how it parallels with your real life event but it's great for in between your next great novel","452":"this book was okay nate is a man who seems to go through way too many relationships before finally landing the right one however nate does not seem to go through any personal changes of growth that allows readers to say he has finally become someone ready for a successful relationship even at the end there are some hints that he may not be fully happy but it seems to work so it's all good there is very little action in this book as a good amount of the time is spent having nate comparing his current relationships to narrated flashbacks of his past girlfriends who kind of remind him of his present dating partner i will say that i kind of envied nate's new york city life of a freelance writer with a book deal even if the romantic part of his life seemed to be in shambles i think the book was meant to be about the modern mentality of today's dating males in society but because the book is written by a female i'm not really sure it came off as authentic as intended i'm also really confused as to why one of the colored left facing heads on the cover looks like a man","453":"it was a great book interesting perspective on dating from the male perspective i enjoyed so much that halfway through the book i knew i would be rereading it at some point it really makes you think interesting read for anyone currently in the dating world being set in the literary world it was very inspiring and informative as well","454":" though a self proclaimed feminist nathaniel is often unfeeling and misogynistic when it comes to women and self centered when it comes to relationships at the beginning of the novel he meets a woman who is his equal intellectually she's also funny and good looking and fairly easy going she is a struggling writer and he is about to publish his first book you would think they'd be perfect for each other but there is something that stops nate from really falling in love i really liked this look into a man's brain it made me think a lot about how i approach relationships--even if it sometimes hit too close

relationship between a man and a woman as narrated from the men's perspective how much power do men have in a relationship today with female liberation waldman did an amazing job with character descriptions and authenticity i could not stop reading this novel and finished it in less than 24 hours","457":"great first novel funny and familiar and well paced i would hate to be one of adelle waldman's hipster literary exes when this book came out though","458":" thanks to the joys of reading on a kindle i can say with some precision that throughout the first 80 percent of the book i kept debating whether i should just stop reading it because i loathed the narrator it's pretty clear you'd have to be an idiot to like the narrator because he's just so awful in so many ways so i decided to soldier on i've stopped reading so many books midway through at this point turns out i kind of liked the last 20 percent even well enough to maybe buy the author's companion novel she's a good writer and i did sort of enjoy her disdain for hipsterism even though it required reading painful descriptions of it","459":"nate reminds me of someone i used to know","460":"sometimes he wished he could turn his brain off me too it's easy to tell a woman wrote this no guy i know obsesses about relationships like nate thankfully but nate tells me more than i care to know about a female pov on

in a few weeks to talk about this novel let's be clear i don't see the point of this book i don't care about nate's pointless love life nate is arrogant selfish full of himslef because nate is a writer so he knows everything better than anyone else nate doesn't know what he wants in life he is a boho please another book to forget this one","463":"a portrait of what we used to call at sassy boy disease nate a self conscious and self involved literary young man in nyc is the quintessential bad boyfriend preferring the chase to the capture way too concerned with what his friends think the book is very very smart and very very funny for me it hits that magic sweet spot in which you get to go i'm reading fancypants literary fiction and omg these characters and omg this is a pageturner simultaneously i'm guessing that most women had a relationship in their 20s that imploded spectacularly and bafflingly and we're all wait what happened even after the pain goes away it's like buh what was wrong with that asshole so this book is cathartic in that it answers the question we get a female author who gets utterly convincingly inside a smart well meaning fucked up guy's head and you watch wincing as he pushes away a spectacular warm insightful interesting funny woman a stand in for us duh because he has boy disease it's kind of quease inducing to read because you see the manifestations of nate's boy disease coming from a mile away and you keep hoping things will end differently but you know they won't it's like when you try to run in a nightmare and your feet don't move","464":"this book is so witty and so well written that if i were a writer by trade i would so hate a waldman","465":"loved loved loved this book i felt that adelle waldman expertly captures what a certain niche of guys from my generation really think and the way they act incredibly insightful frustrating guys are jerks and entertaining","466":"great writing waldman manages to create a loathsome character that's hard to hate","467":"spot on characterization of nate's type that generation i nodded and grimaced through the whole novel","468":"nathaniel p is the composite of every young man i've dated or known in my mid to late twenties baffling in his evasiveness inability to communicate and sporadic changing affections i felt like reading about nate was an inside look at the single male's psyche oh except the love affaire of nathaniel p is written by a woman like the young men i've dated and befriended over the last few years nate frustrates me he fluctuates between effusiveness and resentment toward the women he dates and is unable to mask his irritation he is mired in his work which he proudly shares with the world around him when not working nate is watching sports porn or struggling to motivate himself to clean up his apartment he doesn't cook at all finding celery with almond butter an impossible task when he begins to settle down with hannah different from the women of his past the reader is rooting for a change i'm not sure if adelle waldman is privy to the inner workings of the young man's mind and with that secret knowledge has created a novel so accurate in its portrayal of nate p that dating men everywhere should be nervous or if she has just done an exceptional job of describing what a young woman feels like when her relationship for no apparent reason sours and ends at times i felt this book dragged as nate seems to cycle through the same thoughts nonetheless i was hooked and even laughed out loud at the witty text throughout my favorite laugh aloud moment being the thoughts that race through nate's mind as he struggles with whether or not he should communicate with hannah about how she could perform fellatio more to his liking of course the ever cowardly nate buttons his lip and assures hannah that everything is fine when the poor girl knows for damn sure it's not favorite quotes on abortion what self respecting

of how much i simultaneously enjoyed and hated this book while i can't say that i really liked this book nevertheless i could not put it down perhaps it was because i'm a writer...who's moving to brooklyn soon or perhaps it was because i'm an amateur psychologist who is intrigued with how men and women think in love this book is about love but it doesn't read like most other love stories there really isn't much plot it's sort of like a movie i once watched mr u0026amp mrs bridge an independent film more of a slice of life the film never went anywhere the big climax of the film came when mrs bridge backs her car out of the garage and gets stuck like mr u0026amp mrs bridge this book is more character study slice of life rather than strongly plot driven though sometimes the intellectualizing the characters did grow tiresome the author is a solid writer if you're interested in the psychology of love the pretentious young brooklyn literary scene or just good writing read it","471":"a bit torn about 2 or 3 but well written","472":"so many strengths here as waldman captures the little rationalizations that run through our lives especially the lives of young men who use them to justify their self serving relationships but ultimately the book did seem too small too much of a miniature and perhaps something of a spite novel a novel with an agenda rather than a desire to explore the world and reveal the truths found there waldman's style is so precise so thoughtful can't wait to read her next book","473":"i don't read much fiction but i enjoyed this book especially for women living in nyc","474":"3 5 stars waldman does a pretty awesome job smirking at the smugness of the modern male writer's experience","475":" thoughtful funny and laced with pith this book at once captures the zeitgeist for a certain hypereducated bohemian brooklynite set and lays out the current state of the war of the sexes waldman does uncannily well to put herself in the mind of a man committed to egalitarian liberalism but secretly doubtful about the intellectual capacities of the women he dates nate piven is a narcissist increasingly self justifying and unlikable as the book progresses but most of his foibles and insecurities will be recognisable to any reader below a certain age a few narrative weaknesses which guy spends so much time with his gal pal discussing his dating life do not mar the book's main charms literary wit a thoroughly contemporary sensibility and a poignant awareness of the fear of loneliness hidden deep within us","476":"i had a really hard time liking the title character but perhaps that was the point it was a very pointed look at relationships from a male perspective and how that perspective is ridiculously different from a female perspective","477":"delle waldman review austentatious | alyssa goodnight review","478":" this book was such a disappointment the cover of the book had me thinking this would be a funny witty charming and intelligent story it was not it was the sob story of a typical guy afraid of commitment and not willing to examine his own feelings about it the plot if there was one was not exciting i almost quit this book halfway through after encountering a 10 page monologue about the main character nate's dislikes of things girls did said and emoted ugh the only thing i liked about the book was that it was short so i didn't waste too many days reading it","479":"i concede the author does a great job getting inside nathaniel's head however he's a total jerk and i really did not enjoy being in there the end was disappointing","480":"at first i loved then i hated but it's the nate the main character that influenced my opinion as a singleton in nyc this book resonated even if harshly with me nate oh nate what do i think of you in the end i think aurit is probably right it's a short quick read","481":" this book y'all seriously if you have ever just tried to date someone you should probably read thisthis book chronicles the dating life of nate who is or so he claims a nice guy he's not the malicious sleezeball that we think of when we think of dating he's not leading women on for no other reason than sex he's not the kind of guy that cheats on his gf or the kind of guy that has no empath i received a free copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviewthis book y'all seriously if you have ever just tried to date someone you should probably read thisthis book chronicles the dating life of nate who is or so he claims a nice guy he's not the malicious sleezeball that we think of when we think of dating he's not leading women on for no other reason than sex he's not the kind of guy that cheats on his gf or the kind of guy that has no empathy for other people's feelings he's just a guy who has had a few breakups except he's not not really not from most women's perspective anyway he manages to find fault with the women he is dating without ever taking stock of how his behavior plays a part in the demise of the relationship and that is what made me rage so hard but in a good way because i think it's actually told in a realistic way in some ways he's more despicable than the sleezeball because you expect better from him as a writer and self proclaimed overthinker you expect that he will consider his relationships objectively and from all sides but he doesn't he's the kind of guy you cry over and you cry even harder because you didn't think he would make you cry in the first place nate is the guy you spend hours and days and weeks wondering what did i do wrong the story picks up when he's going to a dinner party hosted by his ex gf elisa and where he meets hannah it chronicles his interactions with hannah as well as flashes back to parts of his relationship with elisa and his first serious gf rachel rebecca and the more you read the harder his book is to swallow not because it's unrealistic but because it is just all too real nate is a little too self absorbed and self important for my tastes but seeing as how he hangs with literary thinkers who spend all day intellectualizing i can see where in that circle he has some appeal but it turns out he is much more self absorbed than you would think upon meeting him and this is ultimately the downfall of the women he interacts with the story itself was pretty good i had some serious problems with the ending and i felt like for someone with such little self awareness he sure spent a lot of time thinking about himself but those problems are to be expected and aren't a flaw of the writer or the writing it's just how the book made me feel and that's the thing about this book you will definitely feel something","482":" it takes some serious talent to make me enjoy so much a book where i cannot stand the main character nate the protagonist is a young harvard educated writer in new york with a novel about to come out he's incredibly snobby arrogant self centered and while he imagines himself to be progressive and quite a catch he's actually really sexist and treats the women in his life terribly one small example in one scene when his girlfriend is giving her opinion on something he thinks that her opinion is not very feminine and she must be re stating something someone else probably a man said first but here's the thing you know people like him you know people like all the other characters in the book you can hate nate but it's impossible not to marvel at waldman's ability to draw such realistic portraits of people it's also a fantastic example of writing from the perspective of someone unlike you and absolutely nailing it i have no idea if this is really how the thought process of a thirty year old new york up and coming male writer works and being a woman neither does waldman but do i buy that it might be yes 100% my one criticism is that the characters spent more time having highbrow intellectual discussions than i thought was realistic maybe those in the new york literary scene really do sit around debating societal issues all day long but after several scenes of it it got a little hard to buy but i really loved waldman's writing and ability to capture so many profound truths from portrayals of the most mundane situations","483":"i liked this and it was definitely engaging and relatable in the sense that i live in nyc and know people in publishing who are neurotic but i can't say i loved nathaniel p and i kept waiting for an ah ha moment that never came at least for me i also can't imagine how this book would be received by anyone who's not in or close to the gen z nyc hipster lib arts degree bracket s","484":"meh don't quite get all of the praise this book is getting","485":"nathaniel is a complete douche but waldman's writing is stellar keenly observed","486":"for chick lit disguised as literary fiction this isn't a bad read in fact it's especially well written and indulgent i am utterly fascinated by the pseudo intellectual ivy literary hipster crowd so i was interested in how it might write about itself i am making assumptions about the author here that are perhaps unfair i have no doubt these characters exist and are true to her portrayal do people waste this much ink on men who write female characters no but the book wasn't good enough to overpower my dislike of all the characters and i will probably soon forget about it until these people inevitably move to astoria","487":"this was a slog not because it was long but because it wasn't all that exciting i considered abandoning it a few times but kept going because i'd already given it so much time already no likeable characters and nothing interesting happens not even any interesting self reflection wasn't my cup of tea","488":"i went in prepared to hate this i mean hello another a waldman but it was pretty fucking great the insight into the way these literary boys think about women terrific","489":"really first class very convincing how the author inhabits the psyche of her male protagonist","490":" i think i enjoyed this in the same way that i enjoy people watching waldman does an exceptional job portraying a young man who is very frustrating very flawed but also very real i could see some major resemblances to men i've known in a lot of nate's behavior and that made it all the more interesting several reviewers have pointed out that waldman doesn't provide a lot of plot the novel is more about seeing snippets of conversations and relationship development it's like being a fly on the wall so to speak it also seems that some reviewers were frustrated by the ending but it felt realistic to me if slightly disappointing","491":" once every two or three years i come across a novel that makes me wonder why i read anything but fiction this was one of them waldman has written a couple of excellent short pieces in the new yorker in the last year or so and i came across a great review of her novel in the london review of books this week that inspired me to pick it up i'm glad that review was the only thing i'd heard about the book before reading it when i saw the blurbs at the end of the kindle edition comedy of manners our generation's jane austen praise from lena dunham i sort of wished i hadn't enjoyed it so much wanted to die i never know how to describe what it is that i like about the fiction that i enjoy but i was completely floored by this one there's a sort of implicit wallace esque faith on display in waldman's work in the ability of modern fiction to deal morally artfully and believably with the way that people live and feel today--a rejection of the idiotic idea that our culture has changed too much for fiction to have real meaning that divorce has ruined the novel when i finished this book tonight i felt a little sad that's the best indicator for me of really good fiction","492":"at first i thought it would be kind of a romantic woody allen kind of book with an older man reflecting on the women in his life then i thought it was just going to be a trashy beach read but the female author did a good job of describing some parts of the male ego how they can't find the problem with certain situations they got themselves into or how choosing a woman has mostly to do with looks and how much his friends value her rather than compatibility but at other times i felt the male character was too descriptive when describing clothes making it seem like a woman was writing it overall a pretty good read although not what i normally go for","493":"a vivid great book i almost gave it one star because nathan is such a jerk but then i realized that probably isn't the best way to judge a novel","494":"three stars for the writing and accuracy some of the conversations were so realistic i felt like i was eavesdropping on pretentious brooklyn kids sitting next to me at a bar storyline was just blah for me though it didn't go anywhere disappointing ending","495":"this book should have been called nathaniel p self absorbed u0026amp self righteous i can't think of any books i've read recently that have a main character as annoying as this one","496":"loved this book coincidentally the last book i read as a bachelor was an excellent depiction of the current dating landscape in white late twenties literary brooklyn from the perspective of a come into success single male writer written by a now successful because of this book brooklyn female you'll nod agreement have strong emotions about many things in the book and it'll make you feel both alone and not alone all at once loved the characters the realistic plotlines of coming in and out of relationships and the various back and forth conversations well captured in this of the moment brooklyn book","497":"so cynical that it kind of put you in a funk to read it","498":"this was a fast read that made me think about gender differences in today's society i found the insight into the male's perspective of nathaniel p fascinating and also more than slightly infuriating","499":"edit re read this so i could draft a fair review but nathaniel p still remains a self absorbed ass still a downer but that's just me 02 2014 wow nathaniel p is a self absorbed ass what a downer","500":" i felt bad rating this book two stars but then i read some other reviews and didn't feel so terrible i'd probably give it 2 5 to be fair after reading numerous encomiums i was excited to find this book at a thrift shop after finishing it myself though i was largely underwhelmed don't get me wrong there were humorous and witty bits to indulge my bibliophilia the characters were developed fully the vocabulary was varied--all presented by a self absorbed narrator then again the voice was the root of all my dislike i would say nate's diverse diction was more excruciatingly erudite than precisely pedantic i'm surprised floccinaucinihilipilification wasn't thrown in there i sometimes felt like nate's cache of words relied on a frantic perusal through a thesaurus because that's how i felt reading the whole thing not to mention that elitism really turns me off also i'm not a thirty something male or female stuck in dissatisfying relationships--or at least not yet i simply couldn't relate or find anything redeeming about nate that being said however i didn't like the book--probably wouldn't read it again at least any time soon --but the author succeeded in portraying both genders' perspective through the thoughts of an incessantly inconsiderate man which is why i would read waldman's sequel from aurit's perspective though i fear that the plot will be just as bare as nate's","501":"i wish i didn't identify with so much of nathaniel's thoughts and romantic experiences well written and funny short enough that you don't get totally sick of the guy i already live with this guy daily so i'm sick of him from pg 1","502":"this review has been hidden because

fashion harvard man that he is many of his imperfections are relatable it is amusing how quickly nate finds flaw in the woman en that he is dating causing him to slowly and in a rather distasteful manner to turn the page this reminded me of jerry in seinfeld who is constantly finding a reason the woman he is seeing is no longer dateable nate's most comical reason s came while at brunch with hannah whom he had already been dating a few months hannah had taken off her jacket underneath she was wearing a strappy tank top it became her she had nice shoulders but when she moved her arms in emphasis of some point nate noticed that the skin underneath jiggled a little bit like a much older woman's it was odd because she was quite fit he felt bad for noticing and even worse for being a little repelled and yet he was transfixed the distaste he felt in its crystalline purity was perversely pleasurable he kept waiting for her to wave her arms again during the same brunch he completes his jerry moment with a moment later hannah got up to use the ladies' room as he watched her walk away he noticed that the jeans she was wearing made her bottom half look bigger than her top half her hips and ass strangely wide and flat he wondered why none of her girlfriends told her this about the jeans why hadn't she herself noticed after all a gigantic full length mirror took up most of her bedroom contrary to these two quotes most of the reasons nate found to move on were not based on appearance even though nate spends much of the novel feeling bad for himself because of his inability to have a long term relationship a result of his cynicism he still comes off as genuine and worthy of some sympathy the author adelle waldman in the end leaves nate in fairly new relationship that he appears to be content with however new is the keyword here and judging from nate's history it is hard to imagine him in a long term relationship that will naturally lose its initial flame this would also require him to accept a woman's faults in the long run as minor as they may be which he has proven incapable of waldman portrays his new relationship's dynamic with greer in a rather favorable light more on the optimistic side than not leaving the reader to wonder whether he will be able to control his wistful yet cunning disposition more","503":" the affliction of shallow people everywhere wanting a person only until it occurs to you that you have succeeded in obtaining them this book is a great study of this character flaw presenting it from the perspective of somebody who is for the purpose of successful introspection a little overeducated and thus blind to his own failings nathaniel spends a great deal of time trying to puzzle out what it is precisely that without fail suddenly puts him off of these fantastic women that he previously felt great tenderness towards and he never acknowledges how obviously formulaic it is nathaniel loves and admires somebody then he notices how cosy and wonderful everything is becomes huffy and petulant and then loses all respect for the woman in question when she becomes hurt and confused at his behaviour this in his mind becomes her problem that she is too eager to please him that her happiness is too dependent on a man's treatment of her nathaniel being an educated man likes to paint a picture of his thoughts being influenced by his progressive feminism and fails to recognise the self loathing that is apparent in his behaviour he can only respect a woman that isn't dumb enough to love him this is made clear by his frequent mooning over exes if and only if they seem not to care too much about him anymore it is his idea of himself as a nice and progressive man that causes him to toy with these women pulling back and forth gaining and losing respect for them according to how much he causes them to care for him and then suddenly withdrawing i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because i love writing that puts forward the complexity of human interactions in a way that is understandable not many people treat others badly for the sake of it these failings are always justified to the person committing them usually through lack of insight into their own motivations as in the case of nathaniel would definitely recommend","504":"at times the emotions were creepily believable at other times i weirded myself out thinking too hard about dialogue in books and how it's kind of weird that the author is just one person sitting around making up conversations in their head and how that kind of defeats the purpose of dialogue and this especially bothered me in the case of this book i think because nathaniel seemed to be so proud of his and his friends' witty intellectual banter that was really just being made up by one person it was a good book but i don't feel like i want to go around telling people about it","505":"meh i read this on the suggestion of a friend of a friend he said it was somewhat trendy recently and set in brooklyn so i thought i'd give it a shot it just wasn't very good a book about the relationships of the eponymous character but the lead character himself just didn't hold together he and most of the other people in the book just seemed like a cobbling together of attributes but not attributes that really worked together in a single person i didn't mind that nathaniel was overall unlikeable well i minded but i understood going in that was going to be the case but i just never felt like he was a real person same thing for the other people in the book overall an annoying and i hope forgettable book","506":"well written but not the debut book of the year as far as i am concerned","507":"this book is wonderful from start to finish it is hilarious and so so clever adelle waldman does an excellent job of getting inside the head of your typical aspiring novelist dude bro who is the product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education and now seeking love and success within new york city's intellectual scene seriously in my perfect world i would make this required reading","508":"eh this book was ok nathaniel is an asshole extremely unlikable in fact i don't think there were any characters in the book that i liked i could relate to some of the ideologies aurit had in regard to dating but that's about it i found the text overly wordy to the point of distraction the love affairs also highlighted what i hate about new york city and the clusters of intellectual pretentious assholes who have nothing to offer but their accomplishments the book really dragged toward the end with his relationship with greer i really couldn't wait for this book to be over","509":" there are a lot of asshole white male narrators in literature the catcher in the rye the secret history this side of paradise it might take readers a full read through or more before the asshole ishness becomes apparent if it ever does in how many high school classrooms is holden caulfield's alarming misogyny genuinely explored or even brought up the love affairs of nathaniel p however doesn't beat around the bush \"you're an asshole \" says one woman to nathaniel on page 8 and there's no refutation provided nathaniel is a harvard graduate son of immigrants who's worked his butt off as a freelance writer for years and has just been granted a six figure advance for his first novel also he's sexist he posits that while \"women are every bit as intelligent as men \" women are just a little less interested in exploring the rational the worthy the interesting they're less likely to be intellectuals he would read books by women - but it's just that for a long time women didn't write as much as men couldn't write as much as men and today if he admires something he reads \"there is about an 80 percent chance that a guy wrote it \"in 1432 leon battista alberti the great architect of the italian renaissance wrote a book called on the family in it he listed the expectations any man should have when choosing a wife that the woman be young beautiful fertile support him throughout his career and care for his children men meanwhile were to go out into the world and pursue their creative lives it's an idea that's existed for a long time and won't be washed away for a long time more adelle waldman explores the dynamics between gender and art ambition and romance as they apply to the elites of modern day new york there are books that explore this less directly that waldman's it's not clumsiness that made waldman skip the subtlety but rather a recognition that this topic deserves a full on examination she shines a light on our relationships to pornography feminism pop culture and each other the conclusions she draws are both daunting and real she takes a little over two hundred pages to explore the question of why intelligent accomplished men end up with beautiful but incompatible women it's a predictable trend baffling but true waldman however zaps it of its mystery maybe hysterical women are desirable because by comparison a man becomes \"beautifully effortlessly right \" maybe that constant assurance that \"he is reasonable far more reasonable than she is \" will make a man \"happier more productive less distracted by loneliness and horniness\" than if he were dating a woman who was his equal who was working hard in the other room and didn't want to be disturbed didn't have time to reassure his fragile masculine ego i enjoyed the book and was left slightly queasy over the qualities of nathaniel p that i can find in my male friends my female friends - and myself","510":" \"it was too late to pretend he hadn't seen her \" this stunning novel opens with nate running into juliet with whom he has had a shared history involving a broken condom nate felt he had done all the right things by juliet telling her \"whatever she wanted he'd support\" and then ultimately paying for the abortion she had decided on now at their unplanned awkward meeting she calls nate \"an asshole \" it's up to the reader throughout the rest of the novel to decide if juliet's assessment is correct nate works and socializes within a circle of elite intellectual writers it seems like his goal second only to becoming a literary icon is to avoid having a meaningful relationship with a woman despite his iron will to remain aloof nate falls into yet another of these seemingly messy entanglements in one goodreads review a reader discounted the novel because nate was \"too self absorbed \" that is actually the beauty and the truth of the novel rendered in waldman's savvy detailed prose the novel has been referred to as a \"comedy of manners \" it is hilarious at times but also tragic nate works so hard against his craving for personal happiness in case you think this novel is nothing but male bashing here is a description of one of nate's girlfriends \"unless they coincided with hers she treated his desires as perverse whims wholly negligible an expensive restaurant she liked was a healthy indulgence his craving for barbecue was 'disgusting ' after social engagements she enjoyed regaling him with a list of criticisms of his behavior she seemed to think that everything he did was first and foremost a reflection on her \"waldman claims that jane austen has been a major influence on her writing the difference between the two authors is that while austen's characters in the early nineteenth century strive to make happy matches waldman's in the twenty first are hell bent to remain single","511":" i almost stopped reading it early on but i kept going in hopes of getting a glimmer of why it was named one of the best books of the year by the new yorker maybe it was just a year that wasn't so good i did find it fascinating to be inside nate's head but he kept annoying me in there and i kept reminding myself this was written by a woman so how much are we really getting that is true male thoughts vs thoughts a woman thinks are in a man's head i did keep reading it though i found the characters annoying","512":" wow nathan is a douche seriously this guy needs to get over himself and his guilt and start seeing women as actual human beings not as something that can be broken or needs to be held up if i had a million dollars for every time nathan mentioned some girls a in jeans i would be happily living on my own island but i don't so i had to listen to nathan drone on about how reasonableness niceness and intelligence don't go together ugh i gave this book four stars though because i thought it was a wonderful piece of writing to consistently make your main character one you love to devote a whole book to developing a few characters with really little action actually going on is phenomenal ms waldman got knocked down a star in my review because she created a character that i would never want to be friends with ever note this is not a book i would take to read on your honeymoon or romantic getaway read this after a chick lit book unfortunately i read it after a constellation of vital phenomena so nate's problems were even more trivial and the outlook on the world even more depressing for all of the negatives i can list about this book though it really was a breath of fresh air something completely different","513":"psychologically insightful incredibly real wonderfully written loved it so much","514":"overall this just seemed boring some insights from nate's brain about dating women were certainly interesting overall though nate's a bougie snob there is no plot to this novel in anyway meh","515":" so i can't stop talking about this book and the only reason i picked it up in the first place is because my male publishing co worker friend person demanded that i read it so he could have someone to freak out at about the crisis of self identity it had brought on him he thought he was basically nathaniel p i've assured him since that he's not but that's the thing about this book i recognized every single character--or at least aspects of them i was cringing with self recognition at some points too especially when hannah regrets all the compromises she realizes she's made just to retain nate's approval oof seriously and nate oh god--i got him i don't like him but i at least think i understand why he acts the way he does which at least allowed me to feel sympathetic towards him... oh i don't know someone else read this so we can talk about it i've currently forced it on at least three different people since finishing for exactly that reason which means--to sum--that i most definitely recommend this book and encourage you to reach out if you've read it too and wanna chat kthnxbai","516":" sigh i did not really enjoy this book the main character is kind of a jerk though he's intelligent so it makes him question what's causing him to be a jerk even as he is one however it had enough thought provoking concepts and quotes about men vs women approaches to relationships and dating in the 21st century that i begrudgingly give this a 3 star rating don't get me wrong it's a well written book i just don't enjoy character driven books as much when the characters inherently annoy me my favorite quote from the book sums up my feelings about it i feel like you want to think what you're feeling is really deep like seriously profound existential shit but to me it looks like the most tired the most average thing in the world","517":" behind the mind of a young intellectual on the dating market there's very realistic view of a self destructive guy wasting away in his own lack of knowing what he wants i'd argue his brilliance is the main reason why he seemed to get bored so quickly of these woman they would intrigue him at first and then fade into normalcy nothing new to learn about them normally a book like this is not my type of style but 'love affairs' is on my favorites book shelf for how real it feels and how easy people can relate to the relationships nathan racked up through the years","518":" waldman's novel as has been mentioned elsewhere reads like a riposte to or perhaps merely an improvement upon keith gessen's all the sad young literary men the n 1 editor's self aggrandizing politically muddled and stylistically still born report from literary brooklyn and it is an improvement waldman's central pair of characters hannah and nate are satisfyingly drawn with a vivid verisimilitude that extends not only to the surface details of their iteration of privileged quasi bohemian literary hipsterdom but also to the tangled irresolvabilities of their self dramatizing inner lives the peripheral characters fare much less well often being trotted out to deliver trite putatively intellectual pet theories about dating gender or pop culture more damningly the novel as a whole drags badly in its middle section in which it becomes clear that the narrative is first and foremost a fictionalized working through of the author's own relationship with a gessen like character waldman's decision to tell the story from nate's perspective was an audacious one and she pulls off the trick of ventriloquism pretty masterfully but despite the occasional sharp insight or funny observation the love affairs of nathaniel p is a little too much about far too little and way too level headed and nice the highest praise a character can offer another here after smart to make much of an impression","519":" i felt that the love affairs of nate p was well written but full of disappointing and tired male stereotypes how is nate a product of a post feminist 1980s childhood yet not think or behave as though he was i enjoyed other aspects of the book but certainly not the outdated men are pigs attitude nate almost redeems himself in the last few pages and paragraphs but then does not this just does not strike me as a true account of how most post feminist men would think and behave still good smart writing and a strong female character lead me to give it 2 1 2 which i'm rounding up to 3 since 1 2s are not an option","520":"entertaining liked the description of how nate wrote","521":"i spent 90% of this book wanting to punch nate in the fucking face so job well done as an author here","522":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here so i was sitting in the doctor's office waiting for my appointment and i found a recent issue of cosmo among the many many vintage issues of boredom in magazine form and in this cosmo june

among the many many vintage issues of boredom in magazine form and in this cosmo june 2014 there was an article about the downward spiral of shame where women date guys who are emotionally unavailable to one degree or another put up with their crap out of fear of seeming needy feel bad about themselves for acting so pathetic put up with more crap etc sounds way too familiar the article pointed me to this book which the author wrote to explore dramatize this phenomenon the book tells the story of nate a somewhat oblivious well meaning jerk and his various relationships mainly the one with hannah who is \"almost universally regarded as nice and smart or smart and nice \" in the beginning nate admires hannah because she's strong and smart and funny and she doesn't just agree with everything he says she challenges him but then he blows her off a few times and she lets it slide and pretty soon she's in the downward spiral of shame what struck me most about this is how hard women in that position including me always try to act like we're not needy we try to play it cool and cover it up and act like nothing bothers us and somehow that's the most desperate thing of all that at least according to this book is what loses us the guy's respect and regard it's only when the girl stops putting up with stuff and looks like she might leave that the guy is at all attracted to her this seems to match my experience in real life in this book hannah finally dumps nate and gets on with her life nate immediately starts dating someone else someone who's a little silly not that smart at least in nate's view and not all snooty intellectual like he likes she's not nearly as good a match for him as hannah yet a year later they're still together he still wants her and they're moving in together what's the difference she lets him see her cry she makes him come over and keep her company when she's scared because someone she knows had their apartment broken into she demands that he stop talking to an ex in short she asks for stuff even if it's unreasonable she even fights with him if need be she doesn't put up with his crap and she doesn't try to play it cool she's real with him even when it's needy or ugly and i think that challenges him enough to keep him interested at a minimum she gets to keep both his respect and her own because she's not always caving or accommodating or letting him walk all over her can it be that simple instead of trying to be low maintenance and expecting the guy to appreciate how lucky he is that you don't ask more just be brazenly high maintenance and expect the guy to rise to the occasion or dump him if he doesn't if this book was written by a guy i'd be more completely convinced that it's a natural law of guyness or something but even if it's not it seems like the right answer regardless of the relationship results more","523":"fav quote dating is probably the most fraught human interaction there is you're sizing people up to see if they're worth your time and attention and they're doing the same to you it's meritocracy applied to personal life but there's no accountability we submit ourselves to these intimate inspections and simultaneously inflict them on others and try to keep our psyches intact to keep from becoming cold and callous and we hope that at the end of it we wind up happier than our grandparents who didn't spend this vast period of their lives these prime years so thoroughly alone coldly and explicitly anatomized again and again","524":"blah no plot just hanging out with a douche who knows that he is a douche but doesn't care because the ladies still inexplicably flock to him must be that ivy league education don't worry if you forget that nate went to harvard he will remind you 68 398 times throughout the book","525":"the goodreads reviews were not so hot for this book so my expectations were low and i came away pleasantly surprised it may be that this book only appeals to a very specific kind of reader do you care if anything much happens in a book do you mind being in the head of a self involved and undesirable protagonist are you annoyed when an author uses words you feel you should know but for which you can never remember the definition if you answered yes to any of these questions then don't read this book but if you're fine with looking into some deliberately flawed characters' lives while they do some stuff for the purpose of elucidating something about relationships and the human condition and using ten dollar words to do it then by all means go ahead but don't say i didn't warn you","526":" reader beware despite the title and the prolific sex that occurs within the pages largely between people who will be together for longer than a one night stand this is not a romance the story chronicles the multiple relationships of nate piven a thirty something year old up and coming author living in brooklyn over the time between college and the present day nate has a problem that shouldn't be difficult to relate to he can't live with women but neither can he live without them his situation is complicated by the fact that his primary relationship is with himself his ability to participate equally in an intimate relationship is modestly impaired and that impairment is greatly augmented by his need to endlessly analyze every aspect of every woman he encounters it gets worse once he sleeps with them it gets more complicated by the fact that while he has quite a few thoughts and impressions about women he is largely unable to verbalize those in real life which is perhaps not a hindrance to his career as an author but it makes him a difficult romantic entanglement the breadth of nate's love affairs allows us to see the range of personalities that smart well educated new yorkers encompass and while the story is told solely from nate's perspective we get a good idea of what his significant relationships entail ironically while nate is able to see that things he valued in high school he no longer finds attractive he has a great deal of trouble operationalizing that insight into his choice of bed mates leaving the reader unsurprised when his relationships collapse over time the book is written in an amused tone and it rarely hits an off tone i wouldn't quiter agree with one reviewer that she is 'the jane austen' of our time but she does share some of that appeal","527":"secret men's business literature brooklyn what more could i ask for and all done with elan and authenticity and style brilliant first novel","528":" one of the greatest boons i discovered upon discovering dating was not the tenderness of someone's arm around your waist or the security of always having friday night plans but the ability to ask boys everything i ever wanted to know about them but wasn't daring enough to ask i have pestered every one of my boyfriends with the same questions how do you talk about girls with your friends what do you truly look for in a girl why did you really break up with your ex are you actually that obsessed with porn yes okay well why because although our brains are identical at birth by our 20s boy brains have been masculinized and girl brains feminized even if we grew up in the most liberal of households and my inquiring mind wants to explore and understand these differences boys and girls are taught to approach the world in fantastically different ways so dating that ritual where we along with our socially acquired differences interact most intimately can become a disaster real fast for example a quick google search for what men are looking for in a girlfriend brings you to this top 10 list which includes \"she lets you be a man\" and \"she respects you \" a lengthier female equivalent 21 things to look for in a boyfriend includes \"he loves your laugh even your ugly laugh\" and \"he knows your favorite dish at the thai place is he knows what movie you two watched on your first date he knows the blanket you love to curl up with when reading \" if we take these articles to represent societal standards it is abundantly obvious how incompatible the \"average\" man and woman's dating goals are and so dating is this fraught often bloody battlefield simply because boys and girls taught to approach sex and relationships differently the love affairs of nathaniel p depicts the inevitable dating explosion that arises when two people cannot overcome this cultural indoctrination it's especially interesting because the protagonist nathaniel p a budding brooklynite writer with a book deal did i mention he has a book deal because nathaniel p wants everyone to know he has a book deal is aware that social forces have influenced his utter romantic failures but he's so weak that he cannot rid himself of these nefarious influences to find truth and happiness in a relationship nate is one of the most frustrating and brilliant characters i've encountered in a while he's the prototype of a white urban intellectual male with heaps of liberal guilt he has this guilt yet he lacks the guts to surmount it he knows for instance that men and women are equal intellectually and regrets that a misogynistic culture refuses to acknowledge that but then he wonders which male academic his girlfriend is quoting when she makes a particularly salient argument and thus nate wallows he thwarts himself searching for ways to be unhappy because he doesn't believe he has a right to be happy nor does he even know what would make him properly happy the closest he comes to discovering happiness is his relationship with hannah also a brilliant young writer though without a book deal nate would like you to know that hannah does not have a book deal though he nathaniel p does have a book deal unlike his previous girlfriends hannah actually challenges nate their relationship is intellectually demanding and nate misogynized subconsciously since birth fears this he fears the equal he recognizes in hannah therefore he sabotages their relationship even though it's the only thing that brings him real unfiltered incandescent joy instead of mere contentment read this book to observe a promising relationship fall apart because a boy has been taught blindly and unwillfully to always prelude every date with \"i'm just not looking for a relationship right now \" read this book if you're the type of person who hears that line and then asks \"okay sure...but why exactly \" waldman in precise piercing prose dissects the anatomy of a \"modern man\" to expose what she calls a certain type of male thinking when she cuts nate up what you see is terrifying and the best evidence that socialized gender norms not only hurt women but men too","529":" on the insanely long list of blurbs that comprises the first few pages of the paperback version of this novel there is a standout piece of praise from a dude on twitter who states that adelle waldman flat out knows dudes true though this may be i think it might be giving short shrift to the fabulously realized female characters that comprise so much of this novel's cast sure we spend the most time with our protagonist nate but he ultimately feels only slightly more real and human than characters like aurit hannah greer juliet or any of the rest of the romantic trail of dead our hero leaves in his path my point being that adelle waldman has thoroughly demonstrated with this fantastically realized first novel that yes she flat out knows dudes flat out knows chicks and in general just flat out knows human beings that sense of humanity is for me the ultimate takeaway in the love affairs of nathaniel p and consistently saturates every page of the novel without falter scathing though waldman may be of the ivy league intellectual class of what bret easton ellis calls generation wuss the author never once loses sight of her characters' virtues when she's highlighting their vices even as nate's never ending rinse cycle of emotional immaturity and callous narcissism seems nigh endless the novel's ending could very well be it's beginning he remains just human enough throughout to not fall irrevocably into jerkass territory arguably the most affecting side effect of this novel's humanity then is its sheer often painful honesty as a member of the privileged and pretentious class of white male 20 somethings that our hero occupies himself i found myself shuddering one more than one occasion at just how accurately unflattering of a self portrait waldman seemed to be painting of me with this novel while this utter commitment to honesty might rob the novel of a coherent unifying thesis statement on the state of sex relationships intellectualism and narcissism and all their various intersections by the end of the thing you'll want nothing to do with such platitudes knowing full well how reductive and insulting they would be to the precedent waldman has set instead waldman shapes every experience in her novel so that it unfolds exactly like real life messy unpleasant and utterly utterly human","530":"i was completely floored having just read a few chapters when i looked at the back flap and saw that a woman wrote this completely floored i was convinced i was reading the confessions of phillip roth's great nephew as much as i cringed it was hard to put down","531":"the hypercritical inner monologue of the main character was a bit bleak but the dialogue and interaction between the characters rang so true","532":"nostalgia is a powerful force i say this by way of preface to my review of this book because i am not able to say with any certainty how much of my positive reaction to this book is based on nostalgia and how much is solely based on the book individually but in the end i don't really care i really enjoyed this book a lot way more than i expected to it reminded me of a bunch of books i read back in the late 80's and early 90's hence the nostalgia warning by authors like bret easton ellis jay mcinnerney and tama janowitz about not entirely or even marginally likeable characters usually living in nyc and often in the publishing industry i especially devoured those when i lived in nyc in the early 90's this book had that feel and tone but had it in a fresh new and up to date way i do not read fiction to read only about nice people who act perfectly and do nice things it's nice to be nice to the nice i read fiction to be immersed in characters situations and plot and this book did that wonderfully yes the narrator is a somewhat immature 30 something who gasp does not treat the women in his life as well as one might want however i didn't find him nearly as objectionable or horrible and advance chatter lead me to expect i would say that if one looks at the women in this book and then wrote from their point of view they would not come off all that much better this is a book about flawed people folks in other words realistic human beings i thought that all the characters were nuanced and well rounded the scene was set very well even though it has been 20 years now since i lived in nyc i was able to understand and visualize where the action was taking place the story isn't one that covers a lot of ground but to me that is integral to the feeling of the book the characters especially nathaniel p are somewhat aimless and still figuring it out i can identify with that anyway my review is my review to me this was easily a five star book and my final conclusion is that this is based on the book not just on the nostalgia value if you get incensed at people behaving like people in your books and not being perfect then you should probably avoid it and read some disney book","533":" the love affairs of nathaniel p claims to be a fascinating and witty look at millennial man and how he approaches relationships maybe it's because i'm a millennial guy myself but i cannot say i'm was rolling on the floor while reading this at some points i was shocked by what the characters did and their thought processes the book revolves around nathaniel commonly referred to as nate and his love life the most prominent female in the story is hannah throughout the book we are taken to new york's literary scene which both nate and hannah belong to as writers most if not all of the characters hold liberal views and the author makes a choice in limiting the actual debate that she writes is occurring between people a creative choice was also made to not name most of the publications that the characters work for when discussing how nate met elisa his ex girlfriend nate says she was the assistant to \"the editor in chief of the very important magazine\" waldman 123 neither nate nor hannah are perfect throughout the book you will most likely find yourself questioning why the characters act as they do and pondering the future of society if this book is accurate there is also a multitude of characters that will appear be gone for awhile and then reappear i recommend making a list where you indicate what kind of relationship they have to nate and if applicable hannah this will greatly help especially since minor characters begin to appear in the end of the book and you're wondering who are these people","534":"a portrait of a womanizer as a young man waldman captures with pin point accuracy the voice of a certain type of liberal intellectual twentysomething writer artist who views his navel gazing as grand existential discourse and his bridge burning romantic travails as an inevitable side effect of his can't be contained genius enter nathaniel nate a thirty year old freelance writer with a recent book deal whose romantic relationships tend to follow a very predictable model meet a girl sleep with girl hang out with girl grow tired of girl's ever expanding flaws break up with girl as we follow him through the course of a five month relationship with many other relationships in between his actions become increasingly narcissistic delusional and sexist and yet fascinatingly still capable of eliciting pathos--and a healthy dose of exasperation nate is not a character that you sympathize with so much as feel pity for everyone knows a nate everyone has dated a nate and if we are being honest everyone probably has a bit of nate in them yet waldman's protagonist is not a well worn stereotype there can only ever be one nathaniel p this book has received many comparisons to austen's novels of manners but i think one could also extend the comparison to charlotte bronte's jane eyre with nate as a stand in for the bombastic befuddling and moody mr rochester there is no woman in the attic but there are certainly women looming large in his phone's contact list for anyone who has tried their hand at the exhausting soul sucking ordeal that is dating post college this book is sweet sweet validation that the struggle is real by the time you reach the final chapter waldman will have you wanting to delete your okcupid account and lock yourself in your apartment forever with only your cats and netflix to keep you company","535":" this book reminded me of edith wharton and claire messud's the emperor's children it was nice to read contemporary literary fiction it's like a literary less funny girls that said i preferred this review to the book itself http www newyorker com online blogs i think the book was somewhat slow because the protagonist nate's life isn't especially dramatic or interesting this book is driven by nate's thoughts and the question what is the appropriate etiquette in the hook up culture nate's an inconsiderate boyfriend if you can call him that who is endured by a number of women waldman makes new york seems like an open buffet of status seeking doormat women willing to tolerate the distant and aloof nate waldman makes him impressively oblivious to their relationship related fretting which i think is an honest reflection of the male mindset nate doesn't spend much mental energy dissecting the status of his relationships or worrying about his significant others reading the book i was reminded of he's just not that into you waldman sort of makes reference to this in the novel where she refers to the power dynamic in a particular marriage as if you don't like it leave that's what nate does to his girlfriends and when expressed so starkly it does seem wrong i wonder if your tolerance of or sympathy to nate depends on whether you're a man or a woman i wouldn't want my daughter to date nate but i especially wouldn't want her to be passive in the face of his indifference surely women have options i thought chapter 10 p 123 was the strongest of the book if every chapter was that good this book would have really been something as is it was an interesting look at modern love and relationships but hardly a must read new classic","536":"i don't know what made me like this book so much but i did i loved it i love how flawed the characters were and the style of writing was so witty and clever i highly recommend this book","537":"i picked this up after seeing it on a few end of year lists i was not overly impressed interesting that it was written by a woman from the point of view of a man it was well written but the story just made me sad","538":" 2 5 starsone of those stories that is almost parody but too realistic at the same time it reminded me of where'd you go bernadette in that way for me it almost makes me wonder if the author is always fully aware of the irony the main character in this is so insufferable and he's supposed to be and that's okay but i had a hard time understanding why the other characters put up with his bs so much also cut it with the condescension re baltimore as i understand it the author is from baltimore so really that's just obnoxious everywhere doesn't need to be brooklyn","539":"now i know what the p stands for prick","540":" i really loved this book although i really grew to hate its protagonist waldman is an excellent writer her word choice is impeccable and i felt like her characters were well defined and not flat even though her protagonist is male i never felt like she was trying too hard to prove she could write in the realm of male characters as a female writer there were no manic pixie dream girls to be found which i feel like can happen in books like this one i feel like this book is an accurate commentary on relationships for my generation right now i know so many friends involved in relationships like the one nate has with his various love affairs i would definitely recommend this book even though it makes the idea of meeting someone decent seem both depressing and impossible","541":"i can't say enough about this up to date seemingly realtime comedy of manners that it's so much more than a 'comedy of manners ' for instance you'll find it on the fiction shelf but it wouldn't be out of place in sociology either and the diction is both impeccable and wildly intelligent read jealousy inducing the book isn't perfect but it's pretty damn close it should be required reading for any and all literary types who've ever been single a staggering debut","542":"very clever commentary on relationships waldman does an expert job of showing the inner workings of nate's jackassery and succeeds in portraying him as someone i'd never want to be with while also eliciting my empathy for him and more for our society","543":"loved it amazing portrayal of this flawed male character by a woman","544":" i already had this book on my to reads list b c of its brooklyn ties but after i saw adelle waldman on a panel at a housing works event i was even more excited about reading it she was so well spoken and thoughtful i can't believe this was her first book and pretty neat she wrote from nate's pov though as a girl i wonder how accurately she portrayed the male mind because i definitely related to his thoughts or maybe i just have a maleish brain uh oh definitely captured the agony and nuances of dating in bk i also enjoyed this glimpse into the social scene of the literary crowd the only reason i'm not giving it more stars is b c the ending felt kind of unsatisfying but maybe i need to sit with it longer and think about it a bit more","545":"the love affairs of nathaniel why would we care about the love affairs of some fictional ivy league graduate new york living sex seeking holier than thou author friends with his exes can hardly ever say precisely how he feels or what he means to oft insecure but never admits it fails in most of his relationships bachelor because he represents the man of the twenty first century the cookie cutter ambivalent guy who realizes what he wants and how lucky he was as soon as he loses the girl is often unable to pick up obvious cues has trouble admitting when he is wrong reluctant to communicate important feelings for fear of not appearing manly in short he has three girls that he shuffles between for a while elisa an ex girlfriend he is now friends with juliet a girl he recently wronged forced an abortion upon but had nothing to say to her when he runs into her on the street months later hannah the extremely patient sweet girl that the majority of nathaniel's story covers she puts up with him more than he deserves yet like many real life guys he fails to really appreciate it i can understand why many readers found this book annoying as did i but what made the difference is that it was quite accurate real life guys are pretty much always this annoying","546":" not a fan of this book at all the main character nate makes single urban men look like trolls jerks narcissistic ugh his way of justifying his actions with the various women in his life the way he treats them his thought processes ugh i sure hope he's not representative of all the single guys out there because if so single women are in trouble i guess the writing was fine the story was meh i think the author's intent was to have nate evolve and thinks that happend i didn't see it i had heard good things about is book from various sources really glad i borrowed it from the library instead of spending any $$ on it","547":"sharp and witty novel about a thirtysomething brooklyn writer and his relationships primarily romantic but platonic as well i didn't particularly like nathaniel but he certainly was a realistically and fully drawn character lots of astute observations about the young literary world in new york as well as the hipster intellectual world in general intelligent as well as being fun and a quick read i ranked it 4 stars but would give it 3 5 stars if that was an option","548":"i read an interview with this writer which sparked my interest the book however turned out a disappointment it is not badly written and has intelligent dialogue but it is too one dimensional for my taste the main character struggles with relationships and dating and at the end the main conclusion appears to be that staying in a long term relationship requires some giving and some taking well i guess i knew that","549":"i really would give it 3 1 2 stars i didn't love the story but thought the author's ability to capture a man's or a certain type of man's perspective was impressive","550":"the writing was good but i felt no empathy for nate and got tired if his personal angst i felt badly for his girlfriends","551":"really well written but good god did i hate everyone in it","552":"incisive gender bending narration not wowed by the prose itself cut a bit close to home","553":"true but frustrating as it is a very true story of a guy and how he deals with relationships","554":"a well written wry story of modern love","555":"i felt as if the shallow and self absorbed college kids from the marriage plot transformed into a literary assortment of 30 somethings for this debut novel i was interested in reading a current novel about this age group it was even more appealing because it is set in brooklyn the writing is good funny in parts but the story left me uninvolved i may like it more if it were a book club book i'll check out some discussion groups i think there is a lot to discuss here","556":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here oh nate hyper aware socially conscious guilt ridden nate i find it fascinating that this book is a book about women from the perspective of a feminist modern man written by a woman i am curious to hear what male readers especially straight males who self identify as progressive or feminist would think of this book i found nate confounding his words say that he wants a woman who is intelligent insightful and funny and he meets her and then pulls the classic god nothing is wrong y oh nate hyper aware socially conscious guilt ridden nate i find it fascinating that this book is a book about women from the perspective of a feminist modern man written by a woman i am curious to hear what male readers especially straight males who self identify as progressive or feminist would think of this book i found nate confounding his words say that he wants a woman who is intelligent insightful and funny and he meets her and then pulls the classic god nothing is wrong you are making mountains out of molehills acts like an asshole trick to get her to break up with him then he decides in the very last chapters of the book to date the woman he previously despised the pretty shallow one who everyone thinks slept her way to the top and he belittles and berates her when they argue finds her writing vacuous and has to adapt to her neediness and this is the relationship that sticks the one he gives up his apartment of course so he can move in with her so the thrust of the book appears to be don't trust those modern men they only say they want smart chicks but what really matter is being hot and intellectually unthreatening i found it fascinating that a large part of nick's issues with hannah stemmed from the fact that he respected her to much too much to be open about what he wanted sexually too much to communicate about the issues in their relationship he was so busy feeling guilty over his male privilege and over thinking every little thing that he couldn't make headspace for the relationship that actually existed he expected her to be angry when she wasn't he couldn't fathom it etc yet when he dates greer his lack of respect for her allows him to fight with her and fight dirty calling someone a stupid cunt in not exactly good practice yet it is during these fights that he manages to tell her what the real issues are so ironically it is only with a woman he doesn't respect that he can be open which reframes the thrust of the book into feminism has ruined men they overthink everything and can't really have a relationship with a woman they respect because a man has to feel powerful and domineering in order to have a safe place to communicate and wow i'm not sure if the author is poking fun at nate and by extension these sterotypes or making a point about the evils of feminism but either way ugh the writing was interesting and i loved hannah even greer was dimensional enough not to be a trope but nate oh nate he and his friends make me infinitely glad to a be married to a man who isn't threatened by intelligence and b not know what is going on in the heads of people around me more","557":"it was okay quick read i really liked the characters but lost interest about 120 pages in","558":"i was choosing between 3 and 4 stars on this one i really enjoyed it and it kept me reading but i can't quite articulate why waldman's style is great but the subject seems a bit shallow i suppose the protagonist is a bit of a dick but it was a relatable tale of millennial relationships and feelings anyway it was good overall","559":"the book and nate is a vehicle to bitch about all the women in the author's life the entire book i thought damn she really hates women i wonder if she originally had herself as the main character dealing with all her friends but someone suggested to critique these women's through the eye of a cis gendered heterosexual male plus the sex scenes were lame hannah was right nate sucked at sex","560":"yes 5 stars its that good waldman immerses you in the world nathaniel p isnt lovable but you care you see his world fully realised and i cant recommend this highly enough so worth your time and it is so lean you never feel the book flags superb","561":"this is truly the worst book in the world to read if you are just beginning to date again","562":"a well written observation of the young literati about whom i quickly discovered i did not give one shit","563":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here hm i am not sure if the author did such a good job in creating a villain that i ended up hating him and furiously finished the book or that i just didn't like the book i read this via a suggestion in marie claire magazine and it did describe it along the lines of a look into a womanizer's head maybe i just didn't know what i was getting myself into i hate the protagonist not just for the reason of oh boo hoo i'm a woman and he's mean to women he is a dick he's the type of dick that n hm i am not

i'm a woman and he's mean to women he is a dick he's the type of dick that needs to use big words to argue points and to speak ad nauseum about random authors maybe this is just because the world that he exists in is solely made up of english and lit majors not sure i'm a bit over his boo hoo story too it'd be nice to write and just exist off of book deals and such i wish that i could've felt bad for him or felt something for him besides disgust obviously i didn't i wanted to punch him in the face most of the time it just seems like he wafts through life using different people as props to keep himself interested in something and not having people as solid investments for the future he just makes me go grrr in frustration when i think about his life and his friends but is all of this emotion i'm feeling a result of good storytelling and a good author i'd be inclined to say so but i'd need to read something else by this author more","564":"interesting not at that point in my life not by a long shot worth a read though for a young man's memoir of finding himeself without ever really finding himself or thinking too hard despite all the hard thinking that goes on in the novel it was a fun read","565":"poetic prose made me dislike men somewhat it impressed me that it was written by a woman","566":" really not a fan of the feeling this book gave me its incessantly intellectualizing grating oft amusing but never lol observations its annoying new new york characters all of them seeming more like snooty journalists than fiction writers artists with screws joyously loose i was thankful for the consistent physical description of characters something so often missing in contemporary novels but the book in general succeeded more as a collection of character sketches than a novel nothing really pulled me through the story other than the rise and fall of a relationship i knew would rise and fall followed by inevitable resolution around page 110 at a party scene i felt like things started to fall off as though nate's humanizing interest in hannah their happiness engaged cruise control en route to the end houllebecq would have done something bold suddenly kill hannah or even nate but no such luck in this as a male writer who lived in brooklyn from 2000 to 2004 i'm not qualified to discuss whether the author did a good job creating a reasonable male who went to harvard and has immigrant parents and doesn't really seem passionate about writing or literature or art or people or music or sports or anything really he's a wishy washy male composite an ink blot of course male readers will associate indistinct rorschachian expressions of manliness with themselves and female readers will nod at something that reminds them of someone they know but really there are many more women in this than nate and his underdescribed friends jason mark eugene kristen aurit elisa hannah greer cara and all of them other than hannah until page 130 or so seem pretty ughful their character assasination verges on fun at times but left me feeling ickily rough cut once the blades of the language seemed to lose some sharpness midway at times the swashbuckling observations shredding inhabitants of contemporary literary brooklyn oh my seemed excessive an exagerration of what it's like to live now more than satirical truthiness also maybe four raised eyebrows pet peeve and sometimes a mechanical seeming 19th century syntax studded with current expletives slang not the worst but like gessen's novel all the sad young literary men i wish these novels about sad young lit types involved experientially open rangy committed various fiction writers and artists more than straight white overly intellectual yet imaginatively close minded journalists debating their privilege concerned with fulfilling their ambition more than developing their art every era gets the nyc depiction it deserves i suppose and it's sad the city its depiction at least has come to this and it didn't even mention the proliferation of high rise condos in brooklyn","567":"some funny bits picking up on williamsburgh zeitgeist dips a bit in the middle but some well made witty observations on the ny scene","568":" depressing all too accurate depiction of a relationship between two bright ambitious twenty something writers n the big city nate's initial attraction to hannah is intellectual even more than physical and before he knows it he's in a relationship but as things get real nate starts backing away with precisely calibrated cruelty that makes him ashamed but doesn't stop him hannah's hurt feelings feed nate's contempt for her neediness and everyone's got a pretty good idea of where it will all end up","569":"fun at first and i can relate to a lot but in the end a bit indulgent","570":"it's hard to like a book with such an unsympathetic narrator but it was a very good read","571":" i put off announcing that i was done with this book for a week i was nervous about reviewing it i live in brooklyn i actually live in one of the neighborhoods featured in this book and i moved here six months ago from one of the other major neighborhoods that waldman is describing more to the point i'm a literary type man who has dated in brooklyn which is what this book is about the book is uncomfortably close to being about me at times though nate is intensely shallow and significantly more misogynist than i am even at my worst in fact if this novel wasn't written by a woman i probably would have forgotten that it's third person singular narration was a narration and i would have wound up thinking that the author was just a misogynist as it is she very accurately and painfully encapsulates the thoughts of a man who styles himself as an intellectual who is nevertheless very shallow and needlessly cruel at times if there's a fault with this book beyond it being the thoughts of a man who's shallow and callow it's that the novel is really slight it's called the love affairs of nathaniel p but it's almost entirely one love affair with some reminisces thrown in i would have appreciated a more sweeping story told with the character but as it it is not only does he not really learn much there's not much indication that he has ever or will ever learn something that's fine enough but the book felt pretty slight nonetheless","572":"i found this book a compelling read and difficult to put down i finished it in 2 days which is unusual for me the conversations in the book felt erudite and yet still authentic the book is not plot driven but rather character driven excellent read","573":"i enjoyed this well written novel with its precise and often unsettling because too close to home descriptions of the protagonist's thoughts and emotions is it a criticism of today's literary hipster landscape or simply an account of a profoundly unhappy 20 something worth discussing what it's definitely not is an incredible feat by a female author at describing the male psyche","574":"i know this guy i've dated this guy how interesting to see a window into the perfectly reasonable way he thinks","575":" ah this is the tonic yes it's another book about a male brooklyn writer but this time it's puncturing the oh so overexposed figure waldman's nate isn't necessarily awful well at least not on purpose waldman works really well with the character showing his selfishness his shallow nature his pretentiousness and lack of self knowledge which lack he would consider implausible thanks to his constant self regard this is a funny book and true if in the end waldman doesn't quite give nate the dose of harsh reality we might wish perhaps his continued inability to grow or see himself is worse punishment smart funny and extremely perceptive about relationships and the small cruelties and lies one can tell in the midst of them so yes a tonic and worth any ten books by gessen levin lerner or safran foer skip those nate ish dopes","576":"this is one of those books that's hard for me to rate she writes imho an unlikeable character so well that i felt annoyed while i was reading i know people like nate p and quite frankly prefer not to ''hang out'' with them","577":"i'm not sure whether san francisco has more than its share of nathaniel ps but we've all dated at least one of them all three stars are for waldman's astute observations about relationships and human nature although i wish there had been a bit more plot movement the novel is still worth reading however and it's pretty short i got through it in a couple of days so low investment i look forward to reading her next book","578":"i liked the setting for the book however i did not care for the main character too much it was just okay","579":"i'd give this book 3 5 stars really 4 stars for the writing the writing is clever and absorbing accurate and authentic i remember these characters well from my 20s the book disappoints in that nate is dull he's not enough of a bad boy to arouse my ire the women are more interesting but of course this is really nate's story","580":"required reading for all misandrists who want to revel in being totally justified in hating dudes holy fuck this guy is a testicle of world ending proportions and what's worse he's just a guy just some dude not a sociopath or an autism sufferer or anything nope the only thing he suffers from is being a dude this read to me like a one woman eyerolling monologue about how incredibly ridiculous it is that women actually want to impress men this badly and give them this level of power 30% gayer on account of reading this my condolences to all women who have to deal with this crap because they're unfortunately into dick","581":"this book welcomes you to brooklyn and you soon gets surrounded intellectual conversation love affairs and career opportunities it is a glimpse into a world which is both very close and very distant i think but it is a cosy page turner welcoming and entertaining","582":"the part i didn't care for as much is towards the end i felt that the description of one of the relationships was summed up in a few pages whereas another relationship had taken up most of the book that's really my only dislike","583":"meh not worth finishing","584":"couldn't slag through this book club pick or no too bad i bought it instead of checking it out from the library","585":"not badly written but there's no narrative drive nate moves sadly sluggishly from one woman to another and that's it","586":"the world's newest literary curio","587":"probably this author has a great nonfiction book in her this novel had interesting social commentary which was engaging","588":"this was okay but did not live up to the promise of the blurb for me","589":"4 stars for acute observation though it made me rather queasy","590":"i found the constant self reflection in this novel very tiresome and the protagonist annoying it appears that nate either picks relationships that are set fail from the very beginning or find ways to ruin a perfectly good relationship just so it can fit his i don't know how to sustain a healthy relationship narrative the only redeeming quality of the novel was the author's use of intellectual verbiage","591":" this is a piece of garbage masquerading as literature i honestly don't understand the positive press it received the writing is incredibly juvenile and all of the characters seem like caricatures drawn up in a freshman creative writing class setting aside the fact that not a single character in the book is likable which isn't necessarily a bad thing and can sometimes be quite interesting the book seems like it was written by an author who was trying to understand a recent breakup that she just can't get over it was so bad it made me angry at least i only wasted a few days on it","592":"not much of a plot character development lacking","593":"insufferable though not entirely inaccurate a story about a relationship that goes stale is in itself quite stale nevermind that the complex millennial characters are wholly unlike able","594":" before starting the review i'd like to thanks @htbrunch magazine for making this review happen through their #brunchbookchallenge in which you have to read just 24 books to complete the challenge for making me read a book by an author who knows exactly how to put some relevant words between more words i met adelle waldman's highly acclaimed the love affairs of nathaniel p a best book of the year 2013 by the new yorker the economist the daily beast the guardian uk and many more being a debut novelist and having a strong reading background having read jane austen george eliot balzac and tolstoy waldman through her words has a eerie talent of describing women through a man's eyes when i had started to read the book i found it quite fascinating on the point that how a woman can describe my subconscious behavior toward women better than myself waldman's novel concentrates on the experiences of a young man nathaniel piven or 'nate' as he is called in short nathaniel piven is harvard drop out ambitiously intellectual well groomed who writes book reviews and cultural criticism for magazines and he's just sold a book for a six figure advance waldman's protagonist is a perfectly honest and socially responsible guy who in her own words as she tells us at the opening \"... was a product of a post feminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education he had learned all about male privilege moreover he was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience \" he is particularly sensitive unlike his male friends who are still amused at rating women's breasts although the book makes reference to several previous love affairs in nate's life the novel concentrates on one promising relationship with an attractive freelance writer named hannah the plot is not that hefty but the author's illustration of relationship insecurities and tension is quite noteworthy on reading nate's present and past and present life one might find him fascinating and i must add that the reality regardless of him being of total screw up is demonstrated by the author very skilfully waldman has used her skill and crafted an elegant story that is humorous and intelligent providing a new look to see the reality the way she portraits the \"love affairs\" of nate his brooklyn life along with the fact that she is illustrating the behavior of man subconscious toward women needs a lot of skill and patience in developing the book i believe adelle waldman has both up to the highest level certainly i am waiting for her next novel i'd like to recommend this book to someone who wants to read something new something different in the contemporary world something which is skillfully written and the best debutante of 2013","595":"i absolutely hated the main character nate is every horrible guy i've ever dated and i am all of the irrational harpy exes you find yourself pitying throughout the story this book depressed the crap out of me","596":"i can see why this was a big best seller youth n sex can't beat it it is written from inside literary brooklyn and is the story of nate a literary striver and a rat with women i hope it is a roman a clef and there there is at this moment a guy wandering through park slope with a pas bag over his head that said the book is a compelling evisceration of a type the narcissistic guy who won't commit to a relationship in that this sort of person is interesting the novel is done as well as possible but narcissists are inherently boring and nate does not escape this difficulty also there is a problem with writing novels about writers writing novels unless the author gets inside writing and shows what the fictional writer is doing his intellectual and creative struggles the book has a vacuum at its core and here the author does not but expects us to be content with the symbolic ephemera of the writing biz publication in prestigious magazines getting a book contract but if nate is the whole book and nate is a writer then it is essential for the reader to know if he's any good which we never learn this is the problem with writing what you know roth carried off the novel of the writer writing barely in some cases but roth is one of the best writers we have ms waldman has a way to go even though she is a good and fairly amusing writer but there is nothing at stake in this novel there is no set of values the author espouses that play out in the life of the protagonist and the events described have little effect on nat's character one thinks at the end so what","597":"it was a well written book however i did not care for the topic","598":"an existential stream of consciousness of a whiny harvard grad","599":"it was interesting to be in the mind of a self absorbed single new york man alas being john malkovich it made it more interesting to know the book was written by a woman single ladies if you want to understand the harsh inner workings of the mind of the modern on the prowl male this book is for you","600":"absolutely terribly boring this book totters between a class paper that could've been called 'a comprehensive multi angle commentary on how big a boring jerk nathaniel piven is' and outright non fiction of the mars u0026amp venus kind there's just a lot of yada yada a bunch of cliched characters who get so boring i'd suffocate if i were in their group and nate oh brother is he a jerk of the first order the narrative pounds on your brain with its dragging pace and as if that isn't quite enough it goes into a dream within a dream kinda setup and halts to delve into commentary about this other girl nate screwed around with from his past why the comparison why the commentary why absolutely no plotline as such and why the hell did i decide to read this one to the end are questions i'd probably never find answers to you're a jerk nate end of story thank you for wasting my time and hannah get a life","601":"funny how without meaning too the books i read tend to theme together this was my second book in a row about a young adult floating through life willfully not assuming responsibility or attaching themselves to events in any deeper way you want to root for nate because he can be so insightful but not about himself in the course of the book he consistently acts like a jerk to the women he dates warning women this will confirm all those suspicions you had about men behaving badly he says he doesn't need to be in a relationship yet spends all his time chatting up women trying to hook up with women and seems to accidentally end up in relationships in the end he admits besides he had come to accept that he was happier more productive less distracted by loneliness and horniness with a girlfriend than without her if that meant he had to make certain compromises for the sake of the relationship so be it rather sad is that how relationships appear to men there are also some choice insights into why dating and relationships are so difficult as people reach their 30's such as many of his friends were far colder and more connoisseur like in their attitudes toward women's appearances as if the tenderer feelings that had animated the crushes of their younger years had been spent or his realization that his relationship with hannah had shown him things about himself that he wasn't entirely proud of about what he really valued in woman and what he claimed to value but in fact could live without which pretty much sums up all his troubles with his relationships in the book needless so say he ends up with a woman he doesn't necessarily respect intellectually but keeps his life interesting is this book sad and depressing yes it's also cringe worthy however the characters are realistically drawn good and bad and there are a lot of laugh out loud descriptions my favorites are bad service was a source of great frustration for her an irritant that might at any moment set her off like science was for the medieval church though i would include the modern church in that observation she'd get this pinched look on her face as if the sheer extravagance of proust's prose was morally objectionable as if there were children in africa who could have better used those excess words","602":"i read this book in two days i had a hard time putting it down once i started i heard a review on npr and was intrigued by the topic and the baltimore and brooklyn connections of the author i thought that the internal voice of the title character was excruciatingly realistic the only complaint was the ending it was a bit trite and seemed to come out of nowhere","603":"i just can't read any more new brooklyn fiction it makes my borough seem so provincial","604":"the thing is i never quite bought that it was a male voice coming from the protagonist","605":" i absolutely loved this book nate isn't an asshole - he often acts like one and he knows it he has deeply ingrained ugly flaws but he keeps that fact in mind at almost all times while he's unfairly judging others and acting on those judgements i dated someone just like nate for six long miserable years and waldman has done a startlingly good job at getting inside the mind of a man who loves women yet belittles them yet idolizes them yet disregards them - basically men who pine for women but want nothing to do with them all the while understanding that he's fucked up and being unclear on whether or not that matters to him in the long run","606":" this is a book that could be easily passed ove by a snob like me but i'm glad i picked it up waldman thoroughly inhabits the life of a 30 something male writer living in brooklyn bushwick with astonishing penetration she conjures his inner voice quite poignantly he is unable to see over most of his emotional roadblocks which creates the tension and tragedy of the story the female protagonist hannah is beautifully delineated and in many ways more real than nathaniel this is an interesting addition to the genre written well enough and memorable","607":"waldman's satirical dissection of today's sensitive literary man not only successfully presents an impecable through compelling characters and a subtle and hilarious writing style but it also provides accurate and dangerously close to home insight about the class and dynamics within the well educated often brooklyn dwelling liberal minded circles of aspiring writers both the women and men who belong to them nate the novel's main character will strike any man with literary aspirations and artistic fantasies i e writers wishing to find a muse and creative companion as both reprehensible and painfully relatable even when most may be in denial about it on the other hand woman may find him pitiful in addition to infuriating and resemblant to an old flame though the universe the novel covers and criticizes may be very reduced and specific that characteristic gives it all the more power and accuracy making waldman's narrative like a contemporary mix of wilde's satirical deft about social mores and fitzgerald's critical eye for class divides and vices in the end nate's affairs regarding love and the inner clash of his liberal ideals and honest desires make for a page turning and remarkable debut novel","608":"merciless smart intense adelle waldman sets herself to diagnosing the perversity of the dating scene for a certain type of successful men and women and she takes the hard road putting herself in the shoes of the man who says and does all the right things only to completely fade away once he's got the girl hooked this is a book for every late 20s and 30s woman who has ever said or had friend say i thought he liked me it was going so well he seemed so into me this is a book for any man who thinks of himself as the good guy in relationships and thinks of his exes as crazy or demanding or can't understand why a girl he dated was so upset when it was just casual i know a lot of people i'd like to recommend this book to except i'd be afraid it would carve them right down to the bones its no wonder why this book has such mixed reviews some people are simply going to hate it as navel gazing about ny some people are going to hate it because the main character is unlikeable and some people are going to use either of those two excuses to avoid having to talk about how deeply upsetting it is to see this reflection of the things they cause or have gone through","609":"a very disappointing read i can't believe how good the reviews have been it reads like a male version of sex in the city only without the humour and with much less interesting characters being so rigidly stuck in the world of publishing the novel is an exercise in navel gazing the main character is irritating self centred and boring which may be what the author intended but if so does not make for an interesting novel","610":"i was really surprised by how much i liked this book at first i hated nathaniel so much that i didn't think i'd get through it but the excellent writing compelled me to keep reading as a 20 something making her way in the career world this was an extremely insightful look at what life is like for my peers in new york as a feminist the way nathaniel justifies his behavior and indicts the women around him is fascinating if you're interested in exploring concepts of neo liberal masculinity and bro feminism you should check this out","611":" this was a bookcon freebie and i unexpectedly had the chance to meet the author who was very pleasant and friendly i hadn't yet read the book or heard much about it so i didn't have much to talk about with her if i saw her again now i'd ask her how difficult it was to get into the head of a guy like nate someone so conflicted so inconsiderate and yet so overthinking at the same time the writing is pretty good and it's overall a decent book but i felt at times like i was forcing myself to get through it i didn't find it terribly interesting it's worth reading if you read a lot of contemporary literary fiction but it's far from one of the best books i've read this year","612":" waldman writes this almost exclusively in a male nat's voice which made me suspect at the beginning i think she does a fine job especially in her debut novel it's been decades since i've dated so i'm guessing that waldman is catching the current mores of society correctly that didn't stop me from wanting to hand all the girls nat dated a copy of the rules or he's just not that into you the no excuses truth to understanding guys for a guy who didn't communicate at all he sure did overthink everything a quick read","613":"very sharp at times i couldn't put it down the protagonist was infuriating sometimes as he was meant to be but that just made it better","614":" i have split feelings on this book the first time i read it was at the beginning of last year and i was a bit disappointed it seemed to me slightly pretentious i didn't like the writing style and thought that the author didn't actually have anything to say i enjoyed it much better the second time maybe it was just the right timing now i'm binge watching satc at the moment so i'm really into shallow dating related nyc stuff now maybe it was that i knew what to expect i can't really pinpoint it i'm sticking with my 3 stars rating but i might have rated it better if this were the first time i'd read it so what do i think about the book now it's a story about dating in new york in the literary circle it's about modern day relationships about the relationship the dynamic between two people what makes people start to date continue a relationship break up stay friends what i didn't like but simultaneously makes the book work are the stereotypical characters he is untidy egoistical passive agressive and thinks women slightly shallow she is seemingly rational and intelligent but underneath that mask hides an over emotional irrational being who wants to talk about everything the friends are pretty much the same lena dunham said the book would inspire flights into lesbianism and the main character our he is being called an anti hero but i don't agree i a woman could relate much more to his side than to these hysterical over analysing women they just got in my nerves something positive the people in there are seemingly smart talking about politics and reading classical russian literature it gave the book a sophisticated vibe i don't want to start a rant here so let me just say this the book is entertaining and i did enjoy reading it but it's somewhat superficial and i wouldn't take it too seriously","615":"whiny entitled ivy league educated pseudo intellectual cowardly man child transplant to new york and passively aggressive closet misogynst wonders why he can't get laid nothing new here new york is full of them yawn the protagonist is a portrait of the hypocritical neo libreral nerd bro\" whose espoused theoretical feminism falls flat outside of being used as a mechanism for picking up women though waldman gives an entertaining account of a deliciously contemptible protagonist the plot is weak and wears thin perhaps the novel would work better as a series of vignettes the focus on nate p 's the p should stand for prick relationship with hannah protracted over several chapters is odd and seems disjointed serving as nothing more than a case study it is strongly undercut by the novel's ending though one has the sense that it isn't an ending just a build up to the next unwritten chapter i have no idea why everyone is fawning over this novel as an innovative look into the male playbook of dating especially in new york it's not a tough safe to crack from brooklyn to murray hill this specimen is widely encountered in hipster bars readings and coffee shops though nate is a fun character to hate i'm not sure that he's entirely convincing he spends way too much time dissecting his flings for a pseudo intellectual dude bro","616":"i waited a long time for this book to be in at the library finally it was available this book is great a funny smart study of brooklyn based intellectual writer nate and his relationships with various women gets into the head of a character in a way most books don't","617":" this book reads like a classic i felt a lot of echoes of truth from my own generation while reading this and it made me think a great deal about how we judge our fellow human beings and even more how we judge ourselves nathaniel suffers from the unfortunate malady of being able to see others' faults very vividly and yet being unable to see his own he is very smart and socially suave which in nathaniel's case makes him suffer from a pretty extreme belief in his own intellectual and social superiority he doesn't think he is racist or misogynistic but it's pretty obvious that he is his pretentious selfishness and frank shock when others succeed where he didn't is pretty repulsive and yet right before you break up with him he says or does something extremely caring i alternated between pitying loathing and liking nathaniel mostly pity though he's not a villain he's not a hero he's just a flawed person who is also an astonishingly bad boyfriend and who just might be able to show you your own weaknesses and then give you the opportunity to do more with that knowledge than he does it's a pretty incredible book despite or maybe because of how frustrating it is to read side note it also left me with a strong distaste for intellectualism there is a strong likelihood that the next five books i read will be fluffy","618":"in the first chapter a minor character calls nate an asshole nate is an asshole a quintessential one unfortunately this book is so beautifully written filled with such clever nuisances about relationships that you've never been able to put into words that it's hard to place the book down and say no to the asshole main character nate really has no idea what he wants but he knows what he doesn't like and he can find something to hate about every woman he dates this book has discouraged me even more about getting back into the dating pool because we all think we're such unique special butterflies when someone we love goes off of us for no apparent reason with very little warning unfortunately this book makes your situation seem less unique and more a hazard of dating in our modern world so read this only if you're comfortably sitting out at recess like myself it won't make you feel good when you glance backwards but you will feel just a hint less crazy","619":"sounds like she just wanted to vent about her experiences while using fancy words and sentence structure waste of time","620":"as much as people hate this book it's a fair representation of today's male yes i said it","621":"this nate guy was quite the douchebag i had a hard time not burning the book afterwards much like after a breakup to get rid of the terrible evidence that it actually happened","622":"an ok entertaining enough read i wonder how this character would have been filtered or interpreted differently by a male author i come away from this story with my notions and experiences confirmed about men of the young ish dating age and i wonder if that is because the character and story was written by a woman in the beginning i was expecting to think that nate was a total d bag right off the bat but i didn't feel that way my dislike for him grew over the course of the book by the end i was thoroughly annoyed that view spoiler he was with greer for so much longer than hannah yet still seemed to not actually be invested in love or anything other than indifferent to who she was especially since greer was a character of almost mystical unattainable poster child like presence throughout the book hide spoiler it just bothered me overall the story had a lot of problems for my taste but i was still entertained by it","623":"kind of a snoozefest","624":"3 5 engaging novel about nate a young writer in manhattan and his ongoing relationships adelle waldman captures the male voice very well and it is set in manhattan and about writers two of my favorite things","625":"i enjoyed this book much more than i expected to nate while occasionally contemptible is a believable character who goes through an interesting but depressingly typical experience throughout the book the language and close examination of character made this book very interesting i personally dropped off a bit towards the end when all of the inevitable chips fell into place but still a worthwhile read full review can be found here https amandakayoaks wordpress com 2","626":"this got a little better the second half but i'm not sure if recommend i'm scared for the world if this is really what guys are like i did relate to some of the thoughts nate had like the guilt ones and have experienced the strange actions of guys in dating so she did a great job i think just not the most exciting book","627":"a captivating book about a man who's kind of a jerk yet also has potential to be a nice guy who hasn't met someone like nate especially if you've worked in publishing and or lived in brooklyn but it's more than just a brooklyn novel and i found myself swept up in it","628":"heartily dislike the main character and by default the alleged smart women he dates for tolerating his bullshit treatment ugh do women really put up with that crap finished it only to see if i'd hate him less at the end nope i get what the author is saying that by being with different people we learn change adapt yeah still don't like him and got bored with the tangents the author went off on to give background to various characters and prior relationships yawn","629":"so micro and claustrophobic sort of fascinating to read the tiniest thoughts of this egotistical self involved brooklyn wannabe hipster and much credit to the author for the writing and realistic tone of his musings but hard to stomach for a whole book's worth","630":"this book really scared me i kept thinking as a i read are men really this shallow this self serving think about women as objects to look at that delight or objects that add value to their lives i found so much of the interior of the main character disturbing selfish completely image driven and in turn i found the characters of the women he dated to be sad in the sense that they thought their worth was increased by association with him or they believed he was a real person capable of caring but who in the end just wanted a hot chick with yoga pants who cried to get her way if this book is meant to be commentary on how shallow male artists are then i don't see where the author is winking other than the fact that a woman wrote it and that seems like a trick aren't men at all pissed off at her portrayal of men maybe the fact that so many men identify so strongly with the text only creepily proves her point is the reason she wrote it either way i find all the characters to be horrid the ending makes sense only in that nate p ends up with a shallow manipulative person like himself his happy ending this book seems to say that we all only really want what we are attracted to and we're happy with the surface and in fact going deeper isn't something humans are capable of or willing to do and that makes me dislike this book maybe it just hit too close to home maybe the points it makes aren't something worth ruminating on especially if they are true maybe she's telling us relationships are all a trick and assigning a lot of meaning to them is our downfall","631":"oy i've read many a book with an unlikeable main character and still enjoyed the book i even contemplated more stars in order to demonstrate that i get what the author was going for but truly i despised this book the characters the caricatures of brooklynites and specifically the young new york literati scene zzzz","632":"initially i went along with it it was funny in parts but then about halfway through i found myself wondering why the hell i was reading it three quarters along i found it boring and the abrupt end left me cold it's a cold book","633":"kept my interest but i wish it would've been written by a man so i could believe more in what the main character was thinking it felt distinctly feminine however the story and characters were engaging and the book well written","634":"maybe it's because i'm a millennial working in brooklyn but i found this an enjoyable quick read it felt like annie hall updated for the 21st century a neurotic new yorker finding and losing romantic connections while reflecting on his outsider roots the women he meets are smart and ambitious yet still vulnerable it seems that he's not always their equal both in maturity and in professional achievement one joke about kale already felt too 2013 but overall the setting was an authentic self aware depiction of this particular moment in nyc culture and development different settings felt authentic without too much name checking or overt reminders of hipness although i agree with other reviewers that gentrification gets overused","635":"i would find a few pages that were relatable then i would go back to the overwhelming feeling that i wanted to punch the main character in the face","636":"this is a convincing portrayal of a certain kind of man and his attitudes to women that makes quite confronting yet pleasurable reading","637":"i'm not quite sure how i feel about this book now that it's over pretty early on i found myself absolutely hating nate yet i continued to read his story hoping and praying he'd get what was coming to him i've never been so frustrated by a character which i feel speaks to waldman's skill as a writer she wrote into being with brave authority nate and his exhaustive nit picky analyses of the women around him unfortunately frustrated is the only thing i felt while reading because not much happened to make me feel otherwise in other words there wasn't much of a plot but what else could a girl like me expect when reading a book that is for the most part the internal monologue of a selfish self important man like nate i'm glad at least the very woman he and his friends had been mocking in the beginning was the one to eventually rein him in however to be honest i don't think he deserved even the smallest bit of happiness","638":" the first lines of chapter two tell us all we need to know about the protagonist nate had not always been the kind of guy women call an asshole only recently had he been popular enough to inspire ill will i'm not entirely convinced that is a true statement especially since he spends this book discounting his astute female friend's theories and philosophies about relationships when he really ought to take them to heart unless of course he likes being an asshole and that is exactly what it seems like this was an excellent novel about some men and the ways they relate or don't to women and intimacy i'm not feeling any better about sharing the planet with them but i'm glad i found a good one better than nate to share my bed with","639":" i think this book was interesting in its premise take the average american successful male and allow him a chance to narrate through his feelings and women however not being a woman who has been scolded and burned intensely by a man i didn't dislike nate because he stood for some anyman that had hurt me rather i disliked him because he was simply just an ass the book itself was good however it isn't long before the intended protagonist becomes the one to leave a bad taste in the reader's mouth","640":"three and a half stars i liked it but it was easy to put down and walk away from that is until the last fifty pages or so when the pace suddenly picks up maybe because then i was pretty invested in the characters there's no real plot beyond will nate finally settle down but the narrative focuses mostly on one love affair that between nate and hannah the book can be read on a number of levels it's a bit of social commentary something jane austen might have written had she lived in 21st century brooklyn and been observing the mating rituals of the hip young literary types there who's doing whom gets wrapped up in who's publishing what and since everyone knows everyone it has a melrose place flavor -- if melrose place had been populated by ambitious intellectuals the bizarre rituals and peculiar snobberies of such a closed set would have appealed to austen it can also be read as crazily accurate foray into the male psyche from across the aisle in the way that she's come undone was wally lamb's spot on portrayal of the female mind lastly the love affairs of nathaniel p can be read as a post feminist rant about what's wrong with dudes today nate is almost an asshole but waldman insists on making him just relatable enough just affable enough that we can't simply hate him he's not don draper every time he does or thinks something awful he loathes himself for it briefly he recognizes his failures but seems to think he's helpless to do anything to fix them you are kinda with nate through most of the book you get what he's saying it's really the ending of the book that damns nate thoroughly and while it's hard to spoil anything for a book with not much plot the following might be considered a spoiler so stop here if you really don't want to know the ending nate got tired of hannah for reasons he couldn't articulate to himself their passion just seemed to fade away nobody's fault he tries to tell himself he's as unhappy about their breakup as anyone he would fix it if he could hannah herself has a diagnosis after they break up she accuses him of wanting only what you can't have the affliction of shallow morons everywhere nate shrugs this off but the reader understands that hannah is completely correct but it gets worse just what's wrong with nate is really revealed when takes up with greer oh this is where waldman's spite comes through greer is tiny and delicate and histrionic and vapid she's like nate's ex elisa one of many ex girlfriends but elisa is developed more than most who is girly and high maintenance as nate's friend jason says girly and high maintenance is what nate actually wants jason points out a notion which nate strongly rejects but which his lasting relationship with greer proves out greer calls nate at midnight to come protect her because a friend of a friend was mugged somewhere -- something hannah would never do and nate obeys greer's sweet little bird like body nate can cover with his big meaty hands she giggles she flirts she enjoys talking about her sexual exploits but can't hold a conversation about the middle east or ending poverty she's not stupid but her intelligence is parochial her world circumscribed to what she can see and touch she's a pretty little feather of a thing and this is exactly what nate wants did waldman read gone girl amy dunne would have a thing or two to say about this nate pretends to be a feminist believes theoretically in all the things the modern progressive male believes in but in the end he wants a kitten he can protect he wants someone stupider than himself so he can feel superior waldman seems to say that you can take the boy out of the misogyny he was raised by right minded people but you can never quite take the misogyny out of the boy in the end this is what's wrong with some men today they are resolutely irrefutably tragically men","641":" this was an intriguing read i'm not sure i entirely liked it but i thought the insights into the various characters or at least nate's was pretty interesting this may have been the love affairs of nathaniel p but i think his biggest love affair was with himself he was a fairly shallow egotistical person and very unlikeable a lot of the other characters we irritating too they all seemed fairly intelligent but i don't think i'd want to spend large amounts of time with people who insisted on always having 'high brow' conversation i can see why comparisons have been made to nick hornby's infinitely better 'high fidelity' a young man who struggles with relationships and we are given audience to his inner dialogues on why this may be the case this novel was almost like a dating manual of sorts pick what kind of girl you are and this is how some men may see you in terms of writing i thought it was somewhat of a confusing writing style section were verbose convoluted and confusing where i felt i needed to reference words other sections were fragmented and stilted","642":"see my review at http www thereportergroup org artic","643":"it made me perversely homesick for brooklyn and all its familiar discomforts","644":" i just finished listening to the audio book it is nice to read while commuting i really liked getting inside the 20 30 something nyc brooklyn literary scene this book was recommended by elle magazine and i typically enjoy their suggestions i found the main character nate to be rude and repulsive at times but i cut him some slack because we were hearing his innermost ugly thoughts the book gets you thinking about what makes or breaks a relationship and what people think they want versus what they truly go for for me the book also got me thinking about how emotionally stunted and poor at communication some men are i'm reading the physical book not audio the happiness project at the same time and wilson notes that close relationships with women make both men and women happier and ease stress it seems unfortunate that men internalize so much and are not better at confronting things head on in love affairs nate has so much internal dialog while it's good he edits some of his thoughts he comes across as cowardly in his inability to speak kindly and directly to his girlfriends exes i suppose in the end his relationship with greer shows he is a complex character capable of growth i am really glad i read this book it was different than a lot of other ones i've read and felt really timely and accurate in its depiction of my age group well the unmarried well educated city dwellers anyhow","645":" it is not unimportant that nate piven's ideal evening is one spent eating a freezer pizza for one while reading lermontov's a hero of our time nate in many ways resembles lermontov's anti hero the cynical self absorbed boredom prone nihilistic but ultimately sensitive pechorin well nate is pechorin without the balls to be an thorough going cad despite his flaws and pechorin is deeply flawed he is one of my favorite characters nate has much of his charm he knows that he is considered a nice guy and the shtick works for him yet he clearly knows he is a bit if a cad his recent writing success his harvard education his feeling of being in a higher intellectual sphere than he actually is haven't done much to dampen is self important social imaging yet on his own he is really just another lonely superfluous man whining in the dark he likes the amenities of a relationship but the hard work the accommodations the lack of a separate life the sacrifice these he can't man up to even with a woman who really demands nothing of him he feels the burden of sacrifice his vacillations and unrelenting self analysis are heartbreaking i wanted to reach through the pages and wring his little neck tell him to stop being such a yutz whining petulant the list could go on and on so why is nate so likeable quite simply he is honest and he is real in fact all if the characters are beautifully developed i was expecting a bunch of latter day seinfeld like caricatures yet that is not what waldman delivered beyond the characters the book is elegantly written comedy of manners in the 21st century at times waldman verges on a satiric tone but ultimately her big heartedness out","646":"i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book it is very well written and philosophically and psychologically complexer than one might think at first glance i will deliver a longer review shortly","647":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book had me loving and hating it every time i turned the page there were moments where i couldn't wait for it to be done but then my attention would be captured again i was surprised this was written my a women i didn't like nate i thought he was a selfish and egotistical ass always wanting what he can't have i'm not even sure if he truly ends up happy in the end","648":" yes bright young man yes you do feel exposed naked simple crude immature lost beta indecisive hallow fake phony etc etc etc this novel exposes the inner monologues of a lot of the said young bright men and the fact that it is written by a woman had to check halfway into the novel in awe makes it even more scary our days as wishy washy mindfucking men gaslighting our women into looking at themselves to fix the problems of our relationships are probably close to finish if someone can and obviously did write this book i must say that while i do think of myself as a good person i can relate a lot with nate and his feelings mostly rationalized irrational feelings when it comes to his intricate relations with women even the way he hides behind a plethora of mental jujitsu to somehow make good with his conscious in a way it is sad to see yourself in this unflattering light in a way it is cheerful to see that this is a road that might lead to a better you i have no clue if people in real life from his kind of social circle talk like tha but for me their narrative was interesting and made me think i understand that for some it might be gag inducing but i really felt that the dialogue worked especially to underline a big theme of the book how to deal with privilege that is intrinsically impossible to earn being white upper middle class american and how to deal with your mundane drama when you know that there are countless of people going through very real difficulties starving poverty racism even genocid all in all i really loved the book and made me reflect laugh nod with approval and sometimes sometimes just shake my head in shame","649":"i definitely see the potential for the book seeming pretentious and was overwrought with unnecessary vocab but i kind of loved this book in my opinion waldman does a good job of illustrating both characters and relationships especially in modern times i'd probably give it a 4 3 if i could","650":"pretentious and unsympathetic characters a frustrating read","651":" this is a novel i didn't want to end it is novel somewhat pretentious elitist authors in brooklyn who in a dark comic way express their opinions of love the protagonist a very intelligent nate analyzes his love affairs and his role in them it is a novel of change learning non stop discussions of relationships certainly it is a book to be re read i have re read this novel i paid more attention to the dialogue between the partners i still don't know why hannah and nate broke up is it nate's fault that he can't keep a relationship going is it possible that relationships have a life of their own when they are over they are over some may last five months some may last 40 years relationships get tired worn out people can work at them but the people get tired of working at them or figure the relationship is no longer worth the effort some people try to be who they think their new partner wants them to be the stress of keeping that guise can he wearing and hurts the relationship i did not see what nate did wrong nor did i see what hannah did wrong one question that comes up is does your partner have to be more important than your goal nate was a writer his book was more important than hannah is that bad","652":"the prose is witty and fresh but god alimighty are we supposed to root for nate by the end i was so disturbed by him that i kept reading on only to make sure karma came back to bite him it didn't it stung","653":" i was so glad to finish this book i just couldn't get into it i actually dreaded reading it and almost quit but glad i didn't it was just alright way too wordy in parts but it had a few good scenes enough to make me plow through the story of nate womanizer and quite picky when it comes to women and his journey falling for a girl and what happens when he gets into a relationship not much happens spoiler alert i'd skip this one 1 5 to 2 stars if you skip the agonizing parts about philosophy and look how smart i am analyzing by the author that almost put me to sleep many a night","654":"i found myself hooked wanting to know more in spite of despising the main characted","655":"one of the greatest strengths of lolita is nabokov's creation of a narrator who is simultaneously repulsive and at least a little bit relatable it's difficult to achieve that balance but waldman's done it here with her narrator nate who'd be thrilled to be compared to nabokov since he judges his paramours by their bookshelves and moves to new york after seeing women reading ol' nabby as his friends called him on the subway nate's not as repugnant as humbert all his dates are of age but there's something similarly predatory in his romantic pursuits and his hypercriticism a desire to live forever in the most exciting newest relationship moments and bail the instant things get boring or serious or ask anything of him nate isn't someone you'd want to get trapped into a conversation with at a party early on he regales a dinner party with his ideas for a new essay on marxism and if college taught me anything it was to tune out whenever anyone mentions marx unless it's immediately preceded by a word ending in \"o\" or followed by the word \"brothers\" nate has the time and money to have such idle thoughts because he's recently sold a first novel for a decent sum giving him time to pontificate and navel gaze although nate's book is essentially based on his own life he never realizes this and judges one of his female friends for only writing things based on her personal experiences in an additionally nice twist nate's novel only really succeeds when he stops focusing on the boring twentysomething character and tells a fictionalized story built around his immigrant parents though he never realizes that he's the least interesting character in his own life story still waldman makes nate just human and just right enough that you'll stick with him through 250 pages then again i have several reasons to relate to a character who grows up in the maryland suburbs and leaves to attend a boston area school in 1995 nate can be logically right even when he's emotionally wrong while other times he's simply so wrong it's amusing and anyone close enough to their 20s to appreciate the myriad stupid arguments and selfishness of the dating world will find plenty to relate to and wince over the portrait of brooklyn full of incredibly attractive toned young writers with book deals or recently published essays in top magazines always running into each other felt a bit strained but i was enjoying the prose too much to care plus i know nothing about brooklyn even sinclair lewis fans would concede that satire can get a bit muddled and boring if applied with too heavy a hand too little preposterousness and people might miss the point too much and there's no humanity to evoke emotions and drive the point home waldman handles this balance masterfully and the result is a wonderful darkly funny novel with several moments that have stuck with me don't let the \"hip young literary brooklyn\" scare you off too much this is a great book","656":"the protagonist is an awful person to spend time with but the book offers depressingly accurate portraits of the young liberal literary set in new york","657":"i really liked the witty discussions between the characters and the absolutely realistic and relatable dissections of nate's relationships but there was no change from start to finish no arc no growth no climax it felt like an incomplete work","658":"i feel the need to write a brief review for this because i didn't want my rating of the book to reflect on how i felt about the main character because boy was he the worst god bless the character of hannah for giving me one person to relate too","659":"my rating would be higher but i had such a deep loathing for the protagonist that i just couldn't i did finish listening to it which says something also the voice the narrator used when he was voicing female characters was borderline offensive maybe crossing the border to downright","660":"very well written and as many reviews have noted acutely observed i felt the author had real insight into how a certain type of male intellectual brooklynite thinks also more generally how many men process think during relationships and the mutability of emotions","661":"every 20 something living in nyc needs to read this book loved it","662":" i was reading reviews on this book and a running theme seemed to be that people didn't like the book because they didn't like the main character i didn't find that to be a problem there's obviously things that are irritating and wrong about him but i found that made the book really honest all of the terrible embarrassing things we think about people when we're dating them things you know are selfish or wrong to think but you think them anyway even though i disagreed with most of his decisions i found the book very entertaining also made me giggle and blush at my own pseduo intellectual moments in life","663":" a story about a certain type of man the upper middle class sensitive liberal type the type who took a woman's studies class in college the type who proudly identifies as a male feminist the type who despite all this can't help but objectify woman at least a little bit and can never bring himself to commit to a relationship even as he realizes how loathsome these failures makes him adelle waldman's prose doesn't exactly sing it's competent but a bit heavy but her dissection of nathaniel p and men like him is commendably brutal and revelatory","664":" i'm 17 percent into this book on my kindle and after not reading it for a week and trying to pick it up again i'm done i don't want to read anymore it's all telling no showing the protagonist is a self absorbed jerk who mistreats women it's ivy league brooklyn trying to be cool crap and i'm not into it at all is there even a plot not as far as i can tell it's just pages and pages of narration about the protagonist who's not someone i want to know and isn't a character i've been given a reason to care about the idea of finishing this book fills me dread so i'm not even going to try","665":"what a disappointment i hated every character in this book particularly the protagonist nearly as much as i hated every character in hbo's girls","666":"i was hoping the title was ironic but no it was seriously about nate's shallow like affairs i found this terribly boring rather than bold touching or funny","667":"hmmm this might explain some of the dating experiences i had in my youth i guess evaluating your partner and trying to figure how they mesh with you is typical but mentally shredding someone because they don't quite fit is just weird","668":" a pal told me that she thought i would like this book i didn't not like it it just didn't do very much for me i didn't like the main character nate because he was a pompous hipster brooklyn dude but the writing was phenomenal i am not nor will i ever be a struggling young anything in nyc nor have i dated anyone in years so it was difficult for me to relate to this book but i imagine it is like glimpsing into the brain of one of the male extras on girls scary funny apathetic all of the above","669":"very addictive fiction and bright viewpoint on today's intellectual youth","670":" oh no i wanted more from this book the only person i found myself relating to in this novel was an extremely peripheral character kristen an ex girlfriend of the book's eponymous male protagonist who as he imagines in one of his multiple fleeting fancies of self awareness meta is so in these days was probably thinking this whole tale was that of a decadent new yorker who whiles away his time on self indulgent personal drama page 209 this novel is meant for a particular socio economic demographic and that's fine it wasn't for me and sigh that's just fine if i were frank though i'd have to admit that i feel like so many other mainstream novels already exist for this niche persona i recommend this book to anyone who is comfortably intellectually u0026amp upwardly mobile--someone who is attractive u0026amp self involved especially if you're single u0026amp a male this story of course speaks to the male experience because sigh #2 of course it does maybe adelle waldman has a limited scope maybe truthfully however i believe she's not that myopic see i get that adelle waldman has a blindsiding message for the passive aggressive male in the world--oops i mean the passive aggressive educated straight caucasian male in new york city just about every character in this novel has a gratuitously critical attitude befitting only a smarmy personality from the big apple --but this book somehow panders too intently to an existing dialogue that is already so darn insufferable anyhow what waldman does in this book is fine but the only trick she's able to pull is shed light from a different angle on the same song u0026amp dance it doesn't feel revolutionary at all possibly even because there's so much meta commentary throughout the book and can we return to that idea of meta commentary for a second here does meta commentary really cut it these days and furthermore why does this contemplation have to be from a man's perspective why whyyyy adelle why going back to what i understood to be the book's original aim i'm ready to move on from the patriarchal game that is contemporary dating just as much as waldman is she even explicitly states as much grace a hannah nate's main love interest the rub however is that waldman offers no remedy for the imbalanced give and take of dating and now i'm wondering if that was what i really hoped for at the outset of this book some kind of diagnosis or audacious alternative to today's dating doldrums i ultimately feel just as clueless as nate i certainly don't feel like i've evolved this book felt like one long running complaint without hope of a lesson on another note while i'm okay with ambiguity at the end of a narrative what i'm not okay with is this book's lack of complexity adelle waldman's language is rich elegant u0026amp ya know pretty darn complex itself but i wish these qualities had translated into the concepts she presented too the love affairs of nathaniel p fell short in the end and i was really rooting for it to achieve something monumental oh well","671":"started off strong and ended up rather predictable i like waldman's style but she does come off as a female writer who may claim to be just one of the guys like one of her characters she's not and that comes through in the arc of the hannah character in the end the story of nathaniel p turned out to be not much more than what my wife assumed it was when she saw me reading it on the beach chick lit it's an enjoyable quick read i'm not knocking chick lit by the way just calling it as i see it","672":"the title fully covers the contents of the book and describes exactly what the book is about the love life of nate it all happens in the writing community of new york nate dreams just like many others of a successful writing career and he is doing everything to establish this it is an intellectual group of people that does not like every other to be successful has an opinion of everybody and discuss this with much bla bla we get acquainted with the love life of nate in his childhood his first lady friends and his last lady friends and we read about the coming and going of hannah as the love of his life what i liked about the book is the way the thoughts of nate are described very well done for a woman to be able to picture how a man thinks first love thoughts are described but also the irritations when the love gets stale usually this happens without realizing how this works often his thoughts and choices are very rational but many times he acts like a complete dick the books is well written enough to be able to lose myself in it and it gives food for thought not a best seller but time well spent reading and enjoying it","673":" life is too short to read bad books i follow this advice gladly i made it about 100 pages in before i couldn't stand it any longer the love affairs of nathaniel p reminded me of a grown up version of a john green novel change the setting from high school to new york from teenagers to thirty somethings well the maincharacter at least and keep the superior geeks and their writing aspirations the novel follows nate who is your average entitled man who likes to lecture every woman he meets when he incidentally meets a girl who stands up to him he is baffled and intruiged interestingly he claims to be raised by a feminist mother and says he knows his way around feminism well that's something you can't tell by reading the novel to me it was offensive in it's way if implying how girls should be should look should behave misogynistic in tone writing style thought and theme it was a sickening reading experience turned out i'm not the only goodreads reviewer with the same thoughts regarding this novel please fellow feminist book lovers do not read this and in the mean time give me a feminist recommendation in need of one","674":"if you ever wondered what was happening in the mind of that self absorbed d bag you used to date chances are this is pretty close recommended","675":"this is the first great book about generation y that i've read it's about a certain intellectual social and geographic category of people and the author even admits that their problems are insignificant compared to for example children with cancer i think that i lived on the same block as the title character with its two liquor stores the one with organic wine and the one with bulletproof glass","676":" maybe i'm just getting old but i think these characters are supposed to be my generation so i think it's me or them i didn't hate the book but i couldn't find any characters i could identify with or even care about they are all 30 something white literary brooklynites who are completely unaware of their privilege as they go about whining about their lives i think it's similar to why i can't watch girls maybe this is the book version except with a male protagonist i kept hoping something would happen and then nothing did at least i was only out the $1 i spent at the friends of the library book sale this book is now back in the pile to go back so the friends of the library can get another $1 from another sucker","677":" i loved this and very interesting to see what a girl thinks a guy is thinking when he thinks about girls but that is a small aspect of this book mainly it's a romantic character study that rotates around a small group of young brooklyn intellectuals i guess some readers want to think of the story in a gender political way is nate an asshole a typical man or a pc wuss but the telling is so even handed and accurate and smart that it transcends any of those issues waldman will no doubt have to endure a lot of reductive interpretations of her book but that just proves how great it is","678":"perfect example of love the writing hate the main character storytelling","679":"well written and insightful however i found the setting the brooklyn lives of hyper educated young people so annoying it was hard to really enjoy this book","680":"this book really seemed to capture the vibe in brooklyn among the freelance set it kept you going but after a while it began to be a bit much the self involvement and selfishness of the main writer and his male friends became a little hard to tolerate still it was a fun read","681":"i'm not sure how much this novel would interest male readers but for women it offers an illuminating glimpse into one man's mind via a female author's mind nathaniel is a recognizable type one who could have been a character on sex u0026amp the city who would have spawned countless conversations as the women would have worked to analyze and understand his mixed signals and so what makes this novel so satisfying is that you actually get the answer with no sugar coating i wouldn't describe the novel in a diminutive way as chick lit though it's insightful smart and well written i really enjoyed it","682":"i keep waiting to get to a point where i didn't hate this guy but it never arrived","683":"really wanted to like this book more but i just didn't","684":" nate is a harvard grad who is involved in the literary scene of brooklyn he has a book coming out in a few months and also writes articles for literary journals his life consists of his writing partying with the literati and trying to have a relationship from which he doesn't tire quickly he goes through women very fast and feels guilty about this as the novel opens nate has broken up with elisa but they are still friends of a sort he goes to a dinner party at her house where he meets hannah with whom he begins a relationship after a few months however he tires of hannah despite the fact that she is interesting and they have a lot in common little things about her bother nate a lot he tries not to be cruel to women when he breaks off with them but he can't seem to find the right way to end his relationships without rancor after hannah comes another woman with whom nate seems to get on with well the book is mainly about the relationships that nate is in he cheats on his girlfriends and feels guilty about it but not guilty enough to prevent him from cheating the novel examines nate's feelings about women and especially the women he is seeing at the time he comes from an immigrant family but hangs out with others that are more refined and economically better off than he is the whole book is about nate and his relationships and break ups there is no real critical mass to the novel and if you are looking for a book with a lot of action this is not it i found it boring after a while as nate solipsistically goes over and over his feelings and actions that have led him to the place he is in with his relationships it is interesting that this book is written by a woman and the main protagonist is a male i think that waldman gets nate but despite this nate is just not that interesting he is one of a certain type of men who has excuses and stories that he tells himself to justify his bad actions overall i can't say that i'd recommend this book as it didn't offer enough for me it had some interesting parts but is repetitive and shallow just like nate","685":"wrenching some say waldman is the modern jane austen perhaps lena dunham says it best waldman has done the heretofore impossible get at the core of the modern female state through the roiling inner monologue of a man her protagonist is well meaning and that may be the most sobering part nate is almost too real this book will inspire laughter chills of recognition","686":"i had read some negative things about this book so i wasn't originally planning to read it but then it was laying around etc etc i ended up quite liking it although i am a bit tired of young male protagoniests finding themselves this was a bit different nathaniel p is an essayist and for lack of a better word intellectual living in nyc in his early 30s the story told from his point of view takes place mostly over the course of his his relationship with hannah also a writer what i felt the book did really well was try to discuss the sort of subtle sexism misogyny of a certain kind of over educated liberal man throughout the book nate makes it clear that abstract intellectual thought which is what he is all about is the highest form of intellectual pursuit and no women at all are capable of this the author does manage to follow nate through all sorts of emotional and psychological contortions as he excuses things he does and also tries occasionally to figure out what he's doing and why while his hypocrisy is totally on display the ways in which the women he dates often do behave predictably is also there i think there is a reasonable amount of food for thought also a fast read","687":"a character study well done can't help judging the book on its difficult to love character lead kind of like disliking an actor because of the role he she plays still found myself wanting to read the inner workings of his narcissistic mind","688":" admittedly i went to this book during a weekend of wallowing after a relationship ended it did the trick this book outlines the reason that the cliched excuse it's not you it's me is often the truest reason we can give to end an affair that was once quite perfect the reality of break ups is that the power rests on the side of the person who wants out and there's no way to renegotiate these politics what we often don't talk about is the fact that the person who wants out is alienated from the moments and essences of the dynamic that were the warmest and that this should be considered a real loss not cause to claim triumph waldman makes that tragedy worth some grievance but she doesn't do it in a way that evades judgment of being irresponsible with another person's feelings the better existence is one that is both capable of affection for worthy people as well as one that is at least affective enough to comport oneself ethically when that affection wanes and these moments of personal reflection on some of the most intimate and scary feelings we have let's face it relationships strike us even the hannahs among us are perfectly nestled within a larger commentary on the phenomenon of being a 20 something in a circle oozing with self importance i can say this because i also associate among intellectuals in my professional and social circles pretension with and without self awareness is equally blameworthy attempts to avoid being a part of gentrification or class structures or whatever other complicit forms we have of systematic injustice always seem hallow and self serving especially among a group of writers who are really just interested in getting established not affecting thinking as such success status attractiveness stealth these things are entangled in ways that make us react similarly to how the characters would feel about their counterparts in the investment banking world the form of masculine depravity contained in the 'bro' can be intellectual it turns out all of this which i can only hit superficially is laid bare in the form of scenes with precise detail to intonations facial expressions character types and movements in conversation she picks the right data to make her point and expose this whole world its virtues and its vices i sailed through it with a bit of narcissistic voyeurism but mostly with hunger for yet another insight","689":" for and about hipsters who hate hipsters who love books lauded by a probably older generation of the lit snob crowd so exactingly dissected within the love affairs of nathaniel p provides its pleasure through contempt for those of us in denial about being immersed in the wide scene of self conscious pretentious aspiring artists this is the perfect non ironic guilty pleasure thickly cloaked in non ironic references to fancy writers and philosophers waldman is self aware enough that she can be granted success in striking balance in this wink nod self criticism of her ilk but her writing skills just don't match up to her sociologist's eye the purposefully hollow moments of human connection are thwarted by awkward lines like he descended upon her so swiftly that she made some sort of girlish giggling noise of suprise cum accommodation before she began kissing him back he felt the cigarette fall to the ground her mouth tasted mildly of ashtray it didn't bother him he liked that she found the antismoking thing 'totalitarian ' p 56 it's the sociologist's eye that makes the book and ultimately redeems it every self involved artist you've dated every neurotic over educated friend you've had every sense of self you've held is dispassionately and accurately analyzed into a collection of simple frivolities and it's pretty tasty this social criticism has drawn comparisons to wharton and austen but such authors have a heart rending humanity at the core of their tales of human folly and ensemble casts of unlikable characters they take us through extravagant labyrinths of our own superficiality to reveal our vulnerability through them we forgive and embrace ourselves as belle laide there is no such essential humanity in walden's story every character remains that collection of frivolous traits not a greater whole perhaps because there is little gesture towards that depth the love affairs of nathaniel p is consistent as its characters if read as a gossipy sociological take down of the hipster lit snob crowd as a breakdown of its archetypes it succeeds right down to a very apt ending","690":"it's not that adelle waldman didn't do a good job of capturing characters or making nate feel like a real human being who i could meet off the street it's just that for most of the book i found myself wondering why i was trying to spend so much time in the head of someone i didn't like","691":" a searingly honest portrayal of the 21st century progressive male to those who repudiate this book for its wholly self centered protagonist you've missed the point entirely nate is awful in the most honest of ways and that's what makes this book his character painfully real and too familiar he is unapologetically unawares of his self involved self centered view of himself and others especially women i truly hated him at times while at others i felt sorry for him as he is so obviously doomed to be trapped in an endless state of subliminal restlessness and wanting nevertheless he always felt real as if he lived off the page and it is this that makes nathaniel p a must read for women of our generation honestly it should be right up there in the canon of must reads for young women along side the likes of jane eyre and pride and prejudice if only to act as a counterbalance","692":"i loved this book gave true insight into what people think when dating the character kind of reminded me of holden caulfield","693":"if i had to do it over i don't think i'd read this again the author seemed to be confused between telling the story of a 20 something male's dating life and professing her vocabulary and literature knowledge it got unnecessarily verbose in some areas","694":"like being inside the mind of so many guys i dated in college and seeing how guys can make you doubt yourself if you haven't learned to be strong but the real question is is it the right girl or right timing that makes nate commit","695":"interesting work nathaniel is real admirably understandable for a woman writer eventually intolerably annoying","696":"the characterization is strong as the reader truly feels as though they know nate however i think this book was just a way to complicate relationships nate drones on and on about girls and analyzes and analyzes it got tired maybe i'm an idealist but i just don't think it's all that complicated","697":"2 5 stars and i'm rounding down on this one the title character is anything but likable but i did enjoy that this distasteful guy was written by a woman","698":"i'd say really this is 3 1 2 stars i found nate very amusing in the beginning very self effacing obsessive rob gordon in high fidelity like but throughout the book he became more and more annoying when his experiences with hannah failed to teach him how to be less of a shallow and selfish asshole who doesn't take responsibility for anything still i enjoyed adelle waldman's writing and gobbled this up quickly was good for a road trip","699":" halfway into the book my thoughts were that it's an upmarket romantic comedy - but then so is pride u0026amp prejudice - and that the lead character is a modern day gawain beating himself up over moral flaws so miniscule that they really only justify a nick in the neck rather than a full beheading a little way further and that view changed nate behaves more badly certainly enough to deserve a shivving from his inner bertilak seems less guilty about it than he ought to be while becoming more self indulgently troubled and the light intellectual humour begins to shade into a specific kind of tragedy the tragedy of being unable to change much is often made of the literary imitation game ie whether a male writer can carry off a female point of view and vice versa ms waldman does a pretty good job here i believed in nate as a person okay he and his male friends think and talk a lot more about relationships than men of my experience but maybe that's just because most of my friends are british all nate's analysis provides him with no jot of increase in self awareness anyway for a while there it looked like he was going to make it or at any rate i hoped he would but like all tragic heroes he has a fatal flaw quibbles some typos a failure to close speech marks that's proofreading stuff there's that tendency of writers now to give too many stage directions during dialogue a wasp at the window is someone holding a fork or a spoon when do they lean back and where are their hands it's a little screenplayish and distracting but it's the fashion and i was unreasonably irked by misuse of the word verisimilitude simply because i happened to use it myself recently at a dinner party and somebody said \"only oxford graduates talk like that \" well nate and his friends are supposed to be harvard graduates and goddamn it if they didn't beat us into third place this year on the times higher education table and you know even to make that observation shows how much the book has sucked me into their world i score it as a high 3 5 well worth reading just not jane austen","700":"so much hype about this book i really wanted to love it i did in a way but i found i was also annoyed nate is an ass albeit a smart ass i felt intellectually stimulated and also like i was at a dive bar listening to hipsters one up each other with mildly intriguing academia perhaps that was the authors intent","701":"nathaniel sucks seriously i haven't disliked a character in novel this much since portnoy the fact that he does not get any come uppance by the end of the book retrospectively ruined this book for me the only thing that kept me going was the feeling that somehow nathan was going to pay in even a small way for his nonsense and nonsense it was that he could be so self involved and so self unaware and not be punished in some way infuriated me","702":"pretty shallow but i still enjoyed reading it","703":" so is this where literary fiction is headed painstakingly written character studies of unlikeable people this reminded me a lot of to rise again at a decent hour only in this case there was absolutely no plot i'm all for social commentary but at least when say jane austen or edith wharton or even tolstoy did it it was the means to an end not the end in and of itself also most of the time i couldn't actually tell whether waldman was reviling or revering the life of the early 21st century brooklyn hipster","704":" when i read on the subway i lose myself in whatever i'm reading i become lost in the places and the characters' lives and when i look up as the train pulls into my stop i swim back to the surface of my life this is probably why i shouldn't have read this book while riding on the l train every day to and from work surfacing from waldmans' world back into a world populated with these exact characters was nothing if not depressing i will have to revisit this book when i'm on a beach or an airplane or somewhere far far away from brooklyn i really really really wanted to love this book but it was just feh","705":"seems brooklynite nate piven would be a catch for any woman he's smart an on the way up author and he really likes women problem is he al tadelle waldman's debut the love affairs of nathaniel p has been called \"the best debut novel of the summer \" now whether it is or not i cannot say as i've not read all the debuts but it certainly is first rate simply couldn't put the book down part social commentary and part character study it is an astute witty elegant look at modern day romance tseems brooklynite nate piven would be a catch for any woman he's smart an on the way up author and he really likes women problem is he always seems to let them down which has won him an unenviable reputation his past relationships have been marked by missteps usually on his part he does have the best intentions but things always go awry just ask juliet or elisa \"contrary to what these women seemed to think he was not indifferent to their happiness and yet he seemed in spite of himself to provoke it \"twaldman traces the literary scene nate's relationships with various women and his friendships most notably with aurit who tries to offer advice this author is quick to take on apt descriptions of those who fail and persevere again in today's attempts to achieve and maintain intimacy finding love in the big city we are reminded is not an easy task twhen he was around 25 nate thought that women were unavailable they were either in a relationship didn't care to be in one or had set their sites on other goals when he reached his 30's nate thought he was surrounded by women who only cared about relationships then at last he meets hannah a writer who seems to have been made in heaven just for him but will he be able to do everything or at least most things right this time around tthe love affairs of nathaniel p is to be enjoyed it's a contemporary comedy of manners filled with insights and penned in lovely prose can't wait to see what adelle waldman will come up with next t gail cooke","706":"remember wickham the blackguard from pride and prejudice or willoughby the blackguard from sense and sensibility now imagine that jane austen told their stories from their points of view not omitting the contempt they felt for the women whose lives they upended or ruined the entitlement they felt to display that contempt their entitlement generally their pettiness their self pity their vanity their moral vacuousness and emotional ugliness now set the story in the twenty first century and you've got nathaniel p he's an asshole you probably won't enjoy the time you spend in his company but you might find the carefully rendered account of his love life fascinating and compelling like a youtube video of the lancing of an abscess so nasty that you just can't look away i have to confess that i did though i also need a real palate cleanser of a book to read next you know an analysis of torture or a discussion of modern warfare something that will make me not care about all the nathaniel p's i've known myself","707":"there are not many times that i've had an emotional reaction to a book like this one i kept changing sides on just how i felt about it one minute getting very upset at what felt like cheap shots at my gender the next admiring a portrayal of the simple deception of a male mind at work the next peevishly setting my nook down and muttering dammit that's low but true while there is no way for me to really connect completely with this novel you'd have to be a writer and or live in new york for that i think this is a pretty good look at how some modern males go through dating and the main character nate feels like an a hole but not one you would imprint as such right away he feels like one of those guys who the first time you meet him male or female you thinks he's great but slowly that high opinion gets eroded as his facade and interest in what you think fades away the only complaint i have with the book is that hannah nate's girlfriend through most of the book seems like she is a little too innocently presented that was my biggest struggle with the book she does nothing to deserve the crap unloaded on her by nate and i'm not sure if waldman does that on purpose to make sure that at the end your alliance is on the preferred side to be fair waldman doesn't portray all the females in the book like that as you learn more about the women in nate's past roads get connected lights turn on and you start to realize why he is how he is and when he finally ends up with a much more attractive and emotionally combative partner that does seem like where he should have been the whole time i read this book quickly and since finishing a couple of days ago have not stopped pondering why it got under my skin it may just be an instinctual reaction to an attack on my team it could be that waldman is actually being unfair loading the decks before the game but i love how much this book made me question every little moment for what it meant it's not a comforting read but a worthy one certainly","708":"i find it difficult to review this book on the one hand waldman succeeded in pulling me into nate's world his observations gave me pause and his decisions made me cringe somewhat against my will i found myself invested in the story and i couldn't put the book down that's a mark of a good novel i think and yet i can't say i enjoyed it very much at all reading other reviews i have come to realize that i was supposed to relate to nate to sympathize with his dilemmas and understand his perspective i really didn't i still don't in my view nate comes across as a narcissistic asshole and an entitled prat despite his introduction as a product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education who had learned all about male privilege and was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience nate's thoughts and actions brand him as the poster child for white cis het high brow intellectual male entitlement one of my favorite lines he didn't like the idea of dating girls jason wouldn't that seemed wrong since nate was clearly the better person more successful as well as more deserving arrogance self righteousness entitlement what a lovely protagonist to cheer for wouldn't you say i could rail on at length about nate's tension fraught relationship with hannah but i won't i'll simply say that i definitely chose a side during their arguments and it sure as hell wasn't nate's of course i should take a step back at this point to note that this book was written by a female author her portrayal of the male mind may not be entirely fair yet numerous critics have lauded waldman for her success in crossing the gender line they've hailed her work as an accurate depiction of the male psyche these facts raise several questions in my mind is waldman just perpetuating stereotypes if so is it problematic that these stereotypes resonate with so many of her readers do white cis het men really think and feel this way what would that mean for the dating world now i understand that one need not like the protagonist to enjoy the book and or appreciate the author's narrative style i still didn't though simply put i found this novel vaguely distressing perhaps it is an accurate portrayal and perhaps i ought to have viewed nate in a more sympathetic light but on the whole the story just made me sad it seems to advance a very cynical perspective about human relationships one that made me question my preconceived notions about the dating world this book raised doubts in my mind where previously there were none and i'm not sure i'm glad for it two stars using the goodreads official scale it was okay the novel was a fairly engrossing read and one that i'll probably reflect on for days to come but god help us if there are really so many nathaniel pivens running amok","709":"i really liked this despite despising the main character although i think that was the point he reminded me so much of someone i dated once my only issue is that i can't figure out where the author was going with it all at the end i found myself thinking that's it","710":"i'm curious whether the majority of guys who read this book find it bitingly on point as some reviews suggest or whether it comes off as what a woman thinks is a bitingly on point look into a guy's mind as he goes through relationships the main character is a jerk who doesn't think he's a jerk so if unlikeable protagonist is a literary deal breaker you might want to skip this one i still found the book interesting a study of modern dating u0026amp behavior","711":"a man's view on relationships and dating some cringe worthy insights but definitely a male perspective","712":"loved this at the start felt it got a little bogged down as it went on very funny nevertheless","713":" have you ever read a book where you kind of want to punch the main character very hard in the face because nate is that guy whilst not told in the first person throughout the love affairs of nathaniel p you are in nate's head he's a twenty something writer living in brooklyn of course he's a super decent guy because he knows stuff about feminism and cares about issues of equality but he thinks that women just haven't written that much notable literature and that they are incapable of being alone unlike men whenever his female friends or his girlfriends get upset he instantly zeroes in on their physical flaws he's uncomfortable about the idea that his friends might not find his girlfriend attractive also gentrification is really bad but like coffee shops so he's a super fun guy to spend time with i don't mind unlikeable lead characters so long as the author isn't trying to make you warm to them a really good example of this is solar which i really enjoyed despite beard being awful waldman clearly doesn't want you to warm to nate and succeeds which is interesting in the sense that had waldman been a guy i get the feeling we'd be expected to feel sorry for nate or that he is representative of how tough it is to be a man dating today i also just loved hannah nate's main love interest in the book who i warmed to despite wanting to reaching through the pages and tell her to come to her senses a lot of people have issues with the ending of the novel that there is no warm feeling of redemption or anything but i guess that's simply because many guys or people in general continually make the same mistakes when it comes to love and nate is definitely one of them this is a three star book simply because i have no desire to go anywhere near nate's life again and i can only really recommend it to people if they have a super high tolerance for really grating protagonists","714":" this novel is supposed to be about a glimpse into one man's mind and how he really thinks about women sex and love huh the beginning of the novel if not promising was good but boy afterward it was such a downfall even though it's written by a women the author seems to hate women nate is a selfish pretentious superficial misogynistic mean and wanna be intellectual asshole hiding behind the helpless nice guy wall the way he sees women made me cringed more than once if not all the time when he sees a woman the first thing he'll notice is a part of her body which is fuckable and he is obsessed with women being skinny the worst was the way sex overshadowed everything else the fact that he's a writer how it is difficult to get publish how nowdays people do not really seem to care about books literature he wasn't in a relationship with women he was fucking them getting laid sleeping with them or they were getting down on hi m sex with the women he dated seemed like nothing more to him than porn always comparing the women he dated with a porn video he had seen or how different it was different from that video jeez i didn't know that he intended on becoming a pornographer and the way he talked about sex sounded most of the time out of place as if the author was trying too hard to show how a guy perceive sex nowdays the depiction of women were bad totally bad except perhaps hanna aurit was too smart for her own good and if nate stayed friend with her it's becaus he knows he's not going to sleep with her geer stupid even though she's outspoken drama queen and on the slutty side elisa a manipulative spoiled girl who's used to get everything her way kristen too rational and pragmatic to really know what a romantic relatioship is supposed to be only hanna offered a glimpse of complexity","715":"i felt like i was inside all of my ex boyfriends heads it made me feel both understanding of their actions and angry all over again i felt myself called out for some things i do and feel it did not make me feel positive about the future of my romantic life but i still couldn't stop reading","716":"the people who inhabit this book live in the rarified ether of the bright and beautiful and the narrator nate as bright a penny as any is thinking about and getting sex despite mounting evidence and his smarts nate is incapable of sizing himself up as as a boyfriend you don't get it the women tell him and he doesn't masters and johnson would have loved this guy","717":"this reminds me of the average american male except far more thoughtful and cerebral nathaniel p and the nameless narrator of kultgen's novel struggle with the same problems of romantic and sexual dissatisfaction and the burden of unmitigated self satisfaction but one novel actually attempts to unpack that idea whereas the other is really just a stream of consciousness about masturbation and the fatness of his girlfriend's arse but i was so unimpressed with the average american male at the time of reading it that i decided not to review it so why waste time on it now beyond noting that the love affairs of nathaniel p reminded me of it clever and well written this novel has a ring of authenticity to its characters and the way they conduct their relationships okay so jason was a bit too much of a wanker sometimes but i thought the rest were quite well formed it can be a little frustrating as you watch nate's relationships unravel but waldman is savvy enough to sit back and let him do the damage to himself while readers shake their heads and tut at his foolishness i wouldn't say that i'm crazy about the book but i think waldman's got talent and i look forward to seeing what else she comes up with oh and did anyone else keep on imagining greta gerwig as hannah","718":"i liked this one pretty well especially how it made fun of a certain type of book i thought the author carried out an interesting experiment in writing from the perspective of a callow brooklyn author but would have liked to have heard even more from the women i found hannah's voice in the email and aurit's monologues the most interesting parts i look forward to seeing what waldman does next","719":"it's more a 2 5 at the beginning i hate this book cause i hate the characters then i liked it just for that reason they are so hatefully realistic just as the writer wanted they represent properly upper middle class spoiled pricks of this time the story was simple i didn't like the way nate's thoughts were presented but overall this book has some interesting point as an undemanding reading","720":"i still do not remember how i painfully managed to finish this book it was basically like reading an episode of sex and the city but instead of four females it's one pretentious unlikable man all of the characters are bland and one dimensional there were few and far between bits of humor i some what enjoyed but not enough to render even a second star rating","721":"i found this book very unpleasant the young aspiring intellectuals who are main characters are pompous pretentious group believing in their superiority based on their education and aspiring writing abilities why do they fell superior to majority of young people of their age i am not sure but mostly they are unhappy lot the nathan's story is simply pathetic and i see him as a plain womaniser with self esteem issues","722":"right place right time for me to read this feels like marriage plot from a different shorter angle in ways","723":" it's frustrating to see so many complaints about nate's likability he's supposed to be a self involved jerk--that's the point i loved everything about this novel from its spot on portrayal of young literary brooklynites to its amazing insight into the male psyche to its sparkling prose waldman gets at something so true about how we date and why we end up with the people we end up with--people who might be inappropriate for us in almost every way if we're dumb and unlucky she's a major new talent and i can't wait to read her next novel","724":"a solid book slice of the brooklyn i hope to hardly ever see again often well written and insightful about a certain type of self involved shallow man who is shallow about deep thinking the book unfortunately has a devil and angel in flat characters aurit and uh the other one the guy i see that the book has lovers and haters i would recommend it","725":"really well written but horrible disappointing ending the last chapters were like a rush job to get it to print after all that lengthy discussion and analyzing of society relationships ambition class culture then it suddenly ended because if its right it just all works itself out and did he really learn anything in the process ugh","726":"didn't so much like the main character but it made for good book club conversation it's surprising that this book was penned by a woman because the central character definitely seems to have a legitimate male perspective","727":" i liked the writing in this book very much and that's why i have it 4 5 however the characters themselves especially nate don't seem to progress in fact i'm tempted to say that this book was written by a bitter woman who having been hurt in the past decided to generalize and apply this ideal to every man in new york it's upsetting and immature to say the least and there are points when waldman over describes a situation or the feelings of a person take it easy on the adjectives in addition this type of contemporary new york writing appealed to my 18 year old self when i wanted to think myself an adult i'm hoping she'll mature a bit in her upcoming books","728":"thoroughly superb a novel about 30 something new yorkers dating would not ordinarily be of interest but this book was instantly engaging and delightful not least because it is beautifully written and smartly observed and has something significant to say about our social mores about gender relations and about the somewhat unfathomable reasons we fall in and out of love","729":"adelle waldman delivers a rollicking debut novel with 'the love affairs of nathaniel p ' sparkling incisive often hilarious writing simply brilliant","730":"when i really dislike a novel i ungenerously assume the author had ulterior motives for writing it in this case i assumed from early on that waldman wrote this book to re frame a particularly hurtful relationship so that she would come out looking perfect and the guy would come off looking like a callow jerk well in that sense the book succeeded it did not succeed in being well written or thoughtful however one of the tropes of the novel was that it was written from a man's point of view by a female author the author used this device to show the reader all the protagonist's most terrible thoughts and expose his deepest worst hypocracies however his inner world was so unbelievably inconsistent with his back story and his representation of himself that the author's judgment of him was too hard to swallow yes a person can be inconsistent with his image but it's an author's job to show why and how the two faces are part of the same coin waldman fails to do this on such a grand scale that almost all the characters and the world they live in seem two dimensional and forced the most glaring problem is that the titular character nate is supposed to be a novelist and the type of person who is always thinking and inside his head however the only thing she shows him thinking about is eating pizza and what his penis happens to be doing at that moment this is not the mind of a man who wrote a novel based on his immigrant parents' marriage in fact he doesn't even seem like a first generation american nate also spends a lot of time thinking about how philosophy gives him a lot of intellectual pleasure however the reader never sees him spend any time thinking about philosophical things we are told things about him not shown and while some discrepencies are meant to be ironic or expose his hypocracy we are not shown how the hypocracies knit together to form a real flesh and blood person in the end this novel just smacked of being a way for the author to get revenge on an ex by re writing their history together to make him look bad and her look cool always throwing out the pithiest insults however who really wins if she had to spend a year trying to get into the mind of a man who only thinks about pizza and his dick her time would have been better spent constructing a character who was worthy of being the subject of a novel","731":" overall a clever book impressive in its characterization though thin on plot waldman is a skillful writer and i could say without hesitation that i knew all the guests at the various parties even if these were parties whose invitations i would have declined nate's problem is not that he's an asshole it's that he's so afraid of damaging the supposedly hyperdelicate feelings of the gentler sex that he is incapable of communicating with them at all acerbic humor a satisfying ending and a spot on portrayal of a particular brand of yuppie just about made up for dragging me through the rather dull middle spent in the head of a bored and rather boring young man","732":"perhaps i expected too much that was probably it but this book really let me down and towards the end became a real chore to finish a boring chore the book didn't seem to have much of a cohesive story save for one guy recollecting his various relationships and trying to justify his decisions as to why they ended i don't really know what i expected but i expected better the writing i found to be cumbersome most times and dialogue was not particularly great the ending didn't do much for me either quite frankly it ended the same way it began nevertheless there were very few times when i was moderately interested by the book and nate piven in quite a character even if he is a bit shallow i found the book overall grayish i definitely won't be re reading this again","733":" i struggled with how to rate this book for me many parts deserved five stars but there were many others i felt were one or two star worthy i enjoyed this book but i didn't love it and i don't necessarily feel that my enjoyment of it makes it good the good parts first and foremost i love the idea a woman writing from a man's perspective on his feelings on relationships commitment sex etc and the male voice of nate was well done i believed that a male in his situation might have those thoughts and feelings also in his own way nate was a very sympathetic character you could see his point of view and understand his reasoning even if you didn't want to be able to while his actions may have come across as assholeish to the women his is with to the reader he didn't necessarily seem that way i loved the intelligent observations that were sprinkled throughout the book about the state of relationships politics education etc a lot of times i felt like i had those same ideas and thoughts but wasn't able to express them quite as eloquently as the author did and many of nate and his friends observations very much resonated with me it also seemed to me as a realistic portrayal of young intellectuals in nyc both many of the good and bad parts and it was nice that all of the characters had both their good and bad sides no caricatures here the bad parts however overall the story itself was not very good it didn't feel coherent the reason for starting and ending where it did was not clear to me parts of it felt like the author just chose to spit up all her random theories and observations into one story and while i loved the observations themselves they definitely contributed to the overall disorganization of the book i was unable to combine or reconcile the nate of the past with the nate of the present in my mind the trips into the past were in themselves a little too long and randomly placed and they also did not help me to feel who nate was as a character in many ways they seemed almost unnecessary as they were hard to incorporate into the larger picture of who nate was and the ending oh the ending so unsatisfying in so many ways i don't want to add any spoilers here but slight spoiler alert it made me feel like the author may have been in a similar situation as hannah and wrote this book to justify why she was not the chosen girl in the end despite her being the better choice on paper as it were his own dismay at aspects of his choice seemed a little unrealistic and it didn't quite feel true that his character would want to stick out the new relationship and why overall my overall impressions of this book were favorable though while it was not necessarily a coherent novel the writing is definitely very smart empathetic interesting and the idea is admirable there are many parts of this book that really made me think and that i will take with me after reading","734":"the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it held my interest long enough for me to finish it but pretty disappointing the author spends way too much time in a lengthy relationship that ends up going nowhere and isn't even all that interesting i found the best passages to be post break up when the book starts to pick up pace and then it's over","735":"a piercing description of the inner workings of over privileged intellectuals though it would have been insufferable in lesser skilled hands the thoughts of the main character zoomed into focus with waldman's insightful yet fair judgment and condemnation","736":"enthralling story that starts a little slowly but the realness of the characters quickly draws you in for me it was both heart warming and depressing and left me feeling conflicted on the characters yet satisfied with the story at the end especially enjoyable for new yorkers that will recognize with the places and the idiosyncratic characteristics of certain personalities","737":"fascinating read about relationships from the male perspective","738":"if you are roughly my age there's a very good chance you either are nathaniel p or have dated him fabulous read","739":" this is the type of book that you can enthusiastically recommend to everyone except the person you're dating adelle waldman skewers the tired machinations of modern relationships in a way that is amusing yet somewhat uncomfortable i often saw aspects of myself in her characters both guys and girls which is why i'd hide this book from a person you're dating they don't quite need to know the absolute truth about you loved it and now i love adelle waldman and have sought out and enjoyed many of her other essays online if she keeps going on like this she may easily become one of my favorite contemporary authors","740":" nate is a thoroughly post modern fellow he is among those who toiled away in adolescence working hard and lusting with futility he is admitted to harvard on merit meaning he captured one of the grind spots where he is dazzled by the privilege that surrounds him he sets off to become a writer and as he accrues successes with publishing so too does his stock rise with the ladies he is stunned and put off but manipulated with great success by the tearful post coital and otherwise noisome tears of his sex partners who sense rightly that nate does not love them he finds one less lachrymose and smart but with low self esteem and blows that relationship to smithereens he hooks up with a cosmo style sex confessional writer scorned by her less successful peers and everything is okey doke in between he confers with a friend who affirms that love yep 'tis woman's whole existence a work starring such a clueless character is the fodder of far too many women's books here however waldman brooks nate no mercy while at the same time opening the window on his internal processes which are much in need of maturation but which show him to be more confused than callow the writing is quite good i will have my eye out for more from waldman","741":" i pictured the main character as the male protagonist from the 40 days of dating website which perhaps illustrates how timely this story really is it's a quick thoughtful read that's both cathartic and anxiety producing for a twenty something woman like me this book interested me not only because it was a brief behavioral study of people in my exact demographic but because i don't date so i observe these behaviors in the real world the way i observed the characters in the book from the outside the novel opens with a george eliot quote and it's fitting because it reads like a modern take on introspective love stories of the past that turn a critical lens on a specific demographic and studies their interactions with each other but its star is the modern anti hero nate is a typical cerebral guy raised by a feminist mother to flourish in an artistic world guys like this are kind of wolves in sheep's clothing they have a progressive equality infused worldview but they can't seem to apply that to the way they act on a micro level in their personal lives or maybe the assume because they're an artistic liberal anti bro they're already gaining points in the dating world without having to put in any of the actual work to reflect their beliefs in their personalities they're like the hipster version of the nice guy an angry seth cohen or zach braff maybe most reviews of this book say that hannah is the first woman nate meets who he perceives as his intellectual equal i think it's probably true that this is the first woman he's willing to accept as his intellectual equal or maybe who wasn't afraid to keep herself firmly planted on his intellectual level whereas the other women he dated withered and gave in underneath the pressure of his moody contrary personality one of the problems with men like this as suggested by nate's inability to understand the women around him is that they can't or won't accept that women often have similar objectives in relationships or that women want the same thing out of relationships the conflict this constantly creates as men who stop wondering whether the problem is their own and keep racing from girl to girl as if to somehow erase the problems of their past relationships is the focus of this novel it's not a plot driven novel it's a character study we're meant to see shreds of ourselves in the characters and wonder how we'd react in their lives adelle waldman is so perceptive and masterful at inhabiting her characters and predicting what they'll do next that the portrait is so realistic biting and engaging especially for people who fall in the demographic she's skewering","742":" though somewhat endearing at the end i found the book generally depressing it was interesting that this almost misogynistic novel was written by a woman that did make it interesting and somewhat comforting that maybe she was making a statement at the sad state of non committal males who settle in relationships where they feel superior in some way to their partners overall however as a woman living in brooklyn potentially running into men of nate's ilk i felt melancholy and did not sympathize with our antihero","743":"i thought this was a really interesting and realistic albeit slightly depressing commentary on dating in the modern perfection seeking world we've created this strange culture of supposed perfection desire in terms of bodies etc with diminished accountability in terms of kindness this book had a lot to say on that in a short witty novel","744":"a sad comment on single life the dating pool could use fewer nate p 's in it","745":" adelle's take on both men and women in this short novel is depressing and accurate the men manage to be completely self indulging and self involved as well as insecure the main male character nate's insecurities manifest themselves differently from the women but they are there nonetheless unfortunately i painfully identified with some of the women's less attractive traits from different times in my own relationships insecurity jealousy hysterics which seemed simply like true emotions being expressed somehow nate flew guiltily yet not affected past a superficial level over the myriad of seemingly pathetic women throughout his late 20's i'll acknowledge that many men view women and relationships through the eyes of nate however i know from experience that not all do those who are better than the nate version of men are what i will call good men they are worth waiting for","746":"excellent examination of romance among the intellectuals from the point of view of an extremely unreliable narrator","747":" in the stacey wants a 10 point rating scale on goodreads this still only gets 2 out of 10 i had high hopes for this but even reading it as a strong critique on the self involved super entitled emotionally inept manchild that is all too pervasive in today's society i still wanted to rip out my eyeballs i don't mind a book that has little plot but in order for a no plot book to work the character study needs to be impeccable this is a character who excels at navel gazing and basically nothing else again even as a societal commentary it needs to go somewhere and this went absolutely nowhere a disappointment to be sure","748":"the characters were too annoying to manage to enjoy the insight that is sometimes offered in this book i was feeling like i might learn something about relationships or human nature from reading this but in the end i was just constantly wondering why i was making myself continue telling a story of over privileged over educated white people and their problems can be done correctly american psycho but there wasn't a lot of irony or satire to give this perspective or something either way it could have been worse but i'm glad it's over","749":" i had this on my bookshelf for nearly a year and a half before i picked it up and read it and while the characters in the novel irritated me to no end it was brilliant the characters are meant to annoy and aggravate you and and adelle waldmen does a fabulous job i thought some parts dragged on more than others the side characters were nearly better than the main ones and the flashbacks to nate's old relationships were superb an effortless balance between the brain of a self engrossed youngish guy as he falls into and out of love with women and into and out of lust and commentary about the world around us","750":"i enjoyed it nate's external self sucks it is uncaring there were times when i wanted to just shake him and say why are you doing this what happened don't say that but in his internal self nate clearly shows that he cares relationship guilt what does it feel like to find the right person is happiness finding balance or is it in the struggle i would love to see the same timeline written from hannah's perspective","751":"great writing hated the character","752":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here while i enjoyed the book and viewed it as a quick read i wish that there had been more of a story line following him the novel brought us full circle we wish that nate would change from his relationship with hannah yet he ends up back at the beginnings of a new relationship at the end of the novel i found that it really shines light on the truth of what jerks men can really be no matter how intelligent or witty nate went to harvard after all he really lacks the connection to others emoti while i enjoyed the book and viewed it as a quick read i wish that there had been more of a story line following him the novel brought us full circle we wish that nate would change from his relationship with hannah yet he ends up back at the beginnings of a new relationship at the end of the novel i found that it really shines light on the truth of what jerks men can really be no matter how intelligent or witty nate went to harvard after all he really lacks the connection to others emotionally in addition to his own emotions the novel really reinforces how many people lack the capacity desire to change more","753":"im really not sure how i felt about this book maybe im a little jaded as i seem to have dated so many nates in nyc but the writing comes across as extremely pretentious and i still don't believe the hannah thing for one second or maybe thats just it too many great women i know are just like hannah and somehow get dumped for completely devoid women who are just so high maintenance and cute to look at so im somewhere between loathed and was ok with the book in the end i think maybe its just a look at stereotypical hipster literary guys who think they have so much to offer but really dont","754":" this is a well written book by an obviously talented writer amazing for a first novel but i should have been forewarned by the boston globe's review that adelle waldman just may be this generation's jane austen i hate jane austen all the talk all the analysis and when it came down to it i didn't much like or care about nate not a good thing for a book that though insightful is essentially plotless but there will be other books by this author i am sure and i look forward to when she has a better story to tell","755":"novel of social manners about the modern world of dating and a guy trying to navigate it without losing his soul","756":"clever well written debut novel about a young well educated male writer in brooklyn by a young well educated female writer somewhat disturbing though hardly novel observations about the male psyche","757":"good book but the protagonist was such a sociopath i had a hard time enjoying it still it's a very incisive look at a particular sort of man","758":" i thought this book was a great read waldman knows her characters and the small society they live in she makes no qualms about the fact that they are selfish snobs her stream of consciousness style is on point and thoughtful for a book that on the surface seems to be about romance the story revolves around a central character nate and the progression of his romantic relationship with hannah both of whom are young writers trying to form find a literary career in nyc we essentially enter nate's inner sanctum and hear his own thoughts about his past and present personal relationships with friends and ex girlfriends alike his voice isn't necessarily charming but it feels true to life in that he doesn't make excuses about his actions and tends to take the easy way out for most personal situations i'll admit it's hard to like him or any of the characters really he's self aggrandizing and self centered but admit it who isn't i admire waldman for being honest about how people see themselves nate is not a character plagued by self doubt instead he believes himself to be in the right 90% of the time he's not critical of his own decisions at least not so much that he's willing to go back and analyze them instead he moves forward at his own pace and achieves the goals that are important to him that's the most any of us can achieve but in the end no one will fault you for thinking he's a bit of prick waldman's deductions on personal relationships as self contained experiences that retain their preciousness only if each partner is different enough from the other than each can satisfyingly retain their own personhood is insightful but the thing that ultimately sticks with you is that each moment passes away and you make of it what you want we tell ourselves our own story just like waldman's self obsessed nate","759":"not much of a plot not much to love about the protagonist but nonetheless an enjoyable step into the mind of well a douche bag during his romantic endeavors and surprisingly an interesting view of the literary community in nyc","760":"i wanted to like this book and in the beginning it wasn't so bad it might have gotten a 2 5 if that was possible since i am impressed an author could make me hate the characters so much i did not understand why the dialogue went from verbose to that sounds nice the character development was confusing at best and as i said not a single one had any sort of redeeming lovable quality for me oh well","761":"i was completely disappointed in this book the main character nate is a complete narcissist in fact he is a writer and at one point in the book he is talking about a book he is writing about his family and himself and he felt his novel only started to come together when this 'insufferable' character was shunted to the sidelines i really think the only people who would enjoy this book are writers in their early 30s living in brooklyn i kept waiting for him to get his comeuppance","762":" this book was clever and funny in unexpected places though the intellectual repartee was a bit much at times above all it was a marvelous character sketch nate was expertly rendered just good enough for us to believe that someone like hannah could be cautiously then wholeheartedly interested in him and just horrible enough for us to believe that he would make her very unhappy he was so interesting because he wasn't truly an asshole he was just a coward and was oblivious to truths about himself that were glaringly obvious to us or i should say truths that were obvious to us most of the time nate was most fascinating when he took me along on his unreliable narrator ride although his faults were usually quite clear there were times when deep in his headspace i found myself thinking \"yeah he's right what else could he have done \" perhaps it was my own bifurcated opinion that made me so uncomfortable with him - it wasn't only that he was unpleasant but that he was also relatable he demonstrated how easy it is to plead blamelessness and let ourselves off the hook through mere technicalities of course i don't want to understate the fact that he was pretty darned unlikeable inevitably each time i started to sympathize with him he would think or say something that pushed the bounds of human decency just a little to far his character was a great intellectual study but wasn't always pleasant to follow and it took most of the book for me to reach a detente with his character the ending was exceptionally well done and fit perfectly with the book's overall tone view spoiler staying with hannah would have challenged nate to become a better person but true to character he went for the easy path instead he settled and missed out on something truly great in the back of his mind he knew this but chose to ignore it the ending wasn't vindictive he's in a decent relationship and wasn't alone and unhappy but he could have done so much better and only we know what he's really missing hide spoiler","763":"thoroughly enjoyed this novel having attended an ivy league institution i felt like adelle waldman really captured what some of these personality types are like her dialogue was very convincing and she provided just enough characterization i had sad that the book came to a close and felt that the end was slightly rushed but i still found this to be a great debut novel","764":"unsympathetic main character","765":"this pretty much sums it up his problems were that of a decadent new yorker who whiles away his time on self indulgent personal drama","766":"sometimes this was a bit hard to get through but only because it was frustratingly too real","767":"i have to admit i almost put this put down this book after the first 25 pages but despite the fact that i found almost all of the characters particularly the main character dislikable i enjoyed the author's style too much i really couldn't put it down if you can stomach characters that you really do not like and enjoy really great writing then i'd recommend this book on a side note this book also made me extremely happy that i do not live in brooklyn and that i am happily married i e not participating in the nyc dating scene","768":"the characters and relationships in the book felt so realistic and honest it filled me rage and disgust and sadness i love that the author is a woman and i'm curious to hear a guy's opinion on it","769":"wavered between a 2 and a 3 on this one found the navel gazing characters insufferable but it was the brooklyn literary hipster setting that was obnoxious not so much the writing i'm glad it was a library book and i can return it now","770":" oh my gosh i loved this so witty and funny and smart an interesting look into the mind of a guy who struggles to treat women well the protagonist nate is at times sympathetic but overwhelmingly a prick a well meaning annoyingly likable and often misogynistic prick i really enjoyed adelle waldman's astute observations on modern dating and really just loved her writing in general so many wonderfully crafted sentences and cutting dialogue and laugh out loud funny or made me want to punch the protagonist's face in lines this book just felt very real to me and was alternatively humorous and frustrating in turns in how it so precisely portrayed reality","771":"a book every single should read and reread","772":"a dark comedy that mocks the modern intellectual","773":"this is as fluidly written a pop novel as you'd want to pick up this year the descriptions are sharp some of the dialogue is amusing and your investment in the characters chiefly of course the title character is immediate that investment takes a hit as the end nears and you have one of of those no way this gets where i hope it goes in this few pages dreads is it fair to hope for certain outcomes in a book that's by design pretty shallow not at all yet for me that soft landing led me to doubt the affection i'd experienced all along and i felt well nathaniel p strung me along you know","774":" the love affairs of nathaniel p is at its core a well told love story that is shockingly realistic its ending grinds against all hollywood has taught us doesn't the interesting hip cool guy always end up with the \"nice and smart or smart and nice\" girl who challenges him waldman kicks idealism to the curb and shows us it's a lot more complicated in real life for actual nice girl hannah and allegedly nice guy nate she delivers us the harsh truth about our generation's post feminist hook up culture told through the point of view of the intelligent well intentioned male protagonist the \"nice guy\" who ends up putting the women he dates through hell and doesn't get the comeuppance he deserves the book is set in brooklyn it seems like everyone in the arts lives in brooklyn and honestly who the heck can blame them but i really think this story could be set anywhere i live in the south and having lived in several red states i can tell you the used books in a southern nate's house might not be from the brown bookstore but the used books are from somewhere i found it to be a universal love story expertly written","775":"nathaniel p is very annoying are we supposed to feel sympathy for him i have no idea he sucks","776":"pretentious high brow references uninteresting characters and very little plot however i do give props to adelle waldman for taking on the task of telling the story from the male perspective and doing a convincing job of getting into the male mindset the relationship patterns are relatable which may be entertaining for those who have too many unanswered questions after a relationship ends but the book ends as it begins no one is any better or wiser","777":" nate piven is a rising star in the new york brooklyn literary world he is also a complete douchecanoe and a selfish misogynist this short novel chronicles the period of about a year in his life as he meets and becomes involved in hannah a writer who doesn't yet have a book deal waldman also dives into nate's past relationships with woman as far back as high school and his relationships with his friends both male and female waldman has really gotten into the head of nate with all his anxieties and flaws she also adeptly chronicles the hipster intellectual literary scene in brooklyn i found nate to be extremely unlikeable on the level of some of philip roth's characters and had to put the book down at certain points because of the claustrophobia of being inside nate's worldview this is a sharp cutting novel waldman never endorses or finds nate's behavior admirable readers not even casually familiar with the literary microculture of the novel may find the characters' behavior quickly tiresome i was glad that i don't live anywhere near the brooklyn literary scene these characters inhabit","778":"self absorbed and believing his own press nate is that curious mix of insecure bravado and utter cluelessness that results in his lack of real connection to the opposite sex typical of the 'tortured artist' mode nate has a tendency to overthink everything that in and of itself is not a bad characteristic unless or until it stops forward progress or the information that you are basing all decisions upon are flawed and that is as i see it most of nate's problem he has zero clue about the development of these characteristics that he can write about he understands compassion and connection and he appears to fit his self proclaimed \"nice guy\" tag but understanding is not the same as incorporating traits into your life i've known several \"nates\" in my life i think everyone has met a couple surprisingly they are rather charismatic and intriguing people on the surface deeper down however the cracks start to show as you have someone who is consistently unable to recognize his own faults or rushes to judgment for he is proclaiming his 'balanced nature' rather than acquiring one it was hard to dislike him entirely however so well nuanced was his underlying insecurity and desire to connect even though he was clueless similarly well defined were the secondary characters complex and well developed they refused to be pigeonholed into the more 'standard expectations' of their initial appearance whether male or female each brought a unique and unexpected twist to their role in the story challenging the reader's general ideas of 30 somethings in the big city i'm torn between this being a stellar satirical view on finding love or a thoughtfully nuanced story based on actual people in real situations the satirical tone is less broad more a nod or covert wink than an elbow and pointing and there are several moments of spot on description and observations that fit the tone of satire then just as quickly the story turns to a more softly spoken retelling encouraging the reader to empathize and connect with the loneliness at the core of the characters their questions and concerns and their insecurities waldman has used her skill and crafted an elegant story that is fast paced humorous and intelligent providing a new look at what it means to be human i received an arc copy from the publisher via netgalley for purpose of honest review i was not compensated for this review all conclusions are my own responsibility","779":"meh a lot of navel gazing by a spoiled neurotic almost hipster","780":"books about writers and intellectuals are always interesting to read because their main focus is the thought and conversation but for that same reason they tend to be understated and somehow pleasurably dull this one is enjoyable but i don't think i will remember it well a year from now","781":"it was amazing how adelle was able to convey the male mindset in this story truly an enjoyable read","782":" i was warned by my coworker who lent the book to me that the protagonist was insufferable and he was in all the worst ways somehow i became determined to finish the book and see it through even though i knew nate would somehow disappoint me as a reader and as a woman and as a person funnily enough after reading the whole thing including waldman's about the author i felt so glad to be able to leave nate waldman and their terribly stuck up reality that has a real life counterpart in brooklyn a place i love and where i live so to be fair the author ably crafted this world and made it so undesirable to me that i was more than happy to even get the book off my nightstand and back to my coworker","783":"gosh this was exhausting despising a character and his flaws this much and it being part of what the author wants you to feel is an intriguing mixture definitely a merciless view on my generation and how we deal with and chase after love","784":"i wanted to like this book so much more than i did i thought it might provide some insight into how young men view themselves and their relationships but it just didn't ring true for me or tell me anything i didn't already suspect","785":"an interesting dive into dysfunctional relationships especially when the cause of the dysfunction is your narrator i found this book incredibly frustrating to read not only was the protagonist incredibly unsympathetic his highly intellectual narrative style was oftentimes for lack of a better word boring though this might be a personal problem the book made me very self conscious of my own life and trust me i don't need the extra anxieties","786":"wow did this book ever strike a chord with me i can understand that a 50 something or someone living in des moines or missoula might find the book incomprehensible however if you are between college age and 40 and have spent any time living in a large american city particularly i presume on the east coast in the past two decades you will recognize some of these characters also if you attended a highly selective college or know people who did the book might also resonate i will be recommending it to my friends who have intimate knowledge of dating in in these big cities in this century the real life scene just as it is in the book is not pretty the author does an excellent job of nailing the angst that accompanies the search for a relationship for many successful or hoping to be successful white middle to upper middle class 30 somethings i read an interview with the author in which she remarked that few novels have been written about dating many more even nowadays are about marriage as fewer americans get married and as those who do skew older than before it is good to read a book which captures that phenomenon","787":" waldman knows quite well the patterns of millennial dating the titular nathaniel p doesn't seem to understand why his relationships end in failure despite him being a delicate if a bit of a distanced lover when nate meets the thoughtful hannah--not his normal type--it seems as though he might have finally found a confidante and true companion but nate remains closed off and soon closes hannah off as well guess what happens next overall i think the novel portrays pre tindr dating quite well but at times the plot felt a bit too mechanical the last quarter of the book flew by in a series of rushed narrations i would have liked to see a bit more of nate dealing with life after hannah but maybe that's waldman's point nate doesn't deal with anything he just moves on","788":"these characters embody the horrible in all of us and reading this book forces you to confront the person you are when you're in a relationship","789":"3 5 stars i always round up very enjoyably written but i'm not sure i i enjoyed i the book much much better version of gessen's all the sad young literary yawns likewise reminiscent to me though i haven't read in a decade of fitzgerald's beautiful and damned waldman captured the phantasmagorical nature of extended male adolescence in ny nicely that said it's a bit inside baseball have trouble imagining non publishing non ny types really getting anything out of the book i hope it doesn't say anything significant about the world or society which would be sad for all of us","790":"i find myself pretty disappointed in the book yet also pretty entertained i love reading about new york intellectuals and their love lives i think what's frustrating about the book is what is frustrating about average everyday people's loves lives you don't get answers and there's no magic to making a relationship work the insight into the mind of nate does not give much hope for intelligent single ladies but it really was entertaining and i read it in one particularly lazy sunday","791":" the love affairs of nathaniel p t lanp or t lamp if we're trying to say it out loud and are using greek morphology centers on the eponymous 30 something harvard educated brooklyn based newly successful writer i e nathaniel p and a few of his relationships with women the writing is fairly strong overall but it's difficult to imagine a less sympathetically drawn protagonist in all of western literature c 1000 bce to present day i have read biographies of war criminals that endeared me more to their subjects than did this novel juvenile screeds posted to r theredpill earned more of my regard than nathaniel's decision making and general attitude i suppose the god of the old testament with his draconian legislation and wholesale destruction of nations compares somewhat less favorably although even he was redeemed somewhat in the sequel i suppose this all may have been the point and we're supposed to pity nate but it's difficult to pity an irredeemable jerk and impossible to enjoy reading about him","792":"i'm not sure i want to know what the other sex is thinking when it comes to relationships or i guess i do but don't want to read about it or maybe i just don't want to read it from nate's pov as you can see i'm not quite sure what i think of this book","793":"this book made me never want to date again fuck you nathaniel p","794":" i feel like this book is on a knife's edge between stunningly awful and pretty great even re readable the first 3 5ths was an infuriating slog full of insufferable characters i found myself hoping that no reader gets confused and starts believing that human males actually think like this and then wondering if maybe some do in a disorienting shift did my mood slip to a more receptive mode the last portion of the book was readable vivid a mite touching and genuinely insightful suddenly i felt like i was reading about real people in a real relationship and not tv drama actors playing the role of wealthy misogynist pretentious shits on the very last page i realized that the author hates the protagonist too this did not really come across perhaps because the other characters were equally as awful finally i love stories about flawed characters ruining their lives and intelligent people stumbling haphazardly into avoidable misery so i know this could have been a lot better do not read unless you know someone who's gone there first and want to talk about it","795":"damn this book is so bitter and cynical i could barely get through it why would a writer intentionally make every single character so unlikeable i kept reading hoping i'd come to some modicum of insight or empathy for nate but in the end it was all just a begrudging hate read full of brooklyn cliches snore by the time i got to the glint of her belly button ring in the moonlit bedroom as her body rose and fell on top of his i nearly hurled this book into a wall i cringe now even typing that out reader do yourself a favor and skip this","796":"very well written but i really hated the main character i can't figure out if that is the point also after research i figured out that the author is indeed from baltimore yet she consistently bashes the city and the state whenever it seemed appropriate being from baltimore i took offense overall 3 5 stars because of how well written it was","797":"waldman's debut is as good as funny and as brutal as everyone says","798":" this novel is a fun and breezy read i actually listened to much of it on audiobook and found that to be a pleasurable way to take it in if you're in any way immersed in the cultural worlds of brooklyn hipsterism wannabe literary critics or contemporary mating rituals you'll probably find something to relate to laugh at or mull over in the narrative that said i think there are some serious problems with the type of novel that waldman has written with her protagonist nate at the center nate is something of a misogynist he finds women to be shallow and essentially incapable of engaging substantively with big ideas so why is this novel not a novel of ideas in some ways waldman has written exactly the type of novel that nate would accuse a female writer of being exclusively capable of writing if that makes sense when waldman does gesture toward nate's or his obnoxious friend jason's big ideas they sound flimsy and trite i didn't find nate's condescension or eventual professional success to be in any way credible i appreciate the candor and curiosity with which waldman has taken on a character like nate but i wish that she had focused less on his sexual conquests and more on the intellectual substance of what putatively distinguishes him from friends and romantic partners alike","799":"it's a sign of a well written protagonist when i simultaneously wanted to punch his teeth out and give him a hug","800":"the writing was four stars but the subject matter was not my thing","801":"an amusing yet also terrifying trip into the psyche of that ineffable beast the late 20 something liberal male proto intellectual not gonna lie this made me a little worried about my dating life and intensely self aware am i one of these girls but it was such a biting and incisive satire that never quite made you hate nate instead you feel exasperatedly fond of him waldman manages to be both annoyed by and intensely empathetic to all her characters and their foibles it makes me want to get a bunch of girls together to read this book and then drink some wine and discuss how realistically mapped these characters are to our real life experiences","802":"i thought the writing was great i loved her use of words but the character never seemed to grow and it ended abruptly like she was told she had to finish the book within the next week and chapter and so she quickly tied it up","803":"started off hilarious and engaging continued whiney and finished in a hurry i just realized that describes all relationships she attempts to describe extremely readable highly recommended for a long flight","804":"this book felt a little limited in scope and though i loved the sharp writing and vivid descriptions nate's love affairs began to get a little tedious at its best the book reminded me of work by nick hornby or jeffrey eugenides but after a while the energy of the book lagged","805":"the writing is good but nate is such a jerk that it's hard to say that i liked this book","806":"3 75 stars recommended by my therapist following a recent break up this book and manchild's relationship definitely resonated with me i'm not sure i totally believe that this is how guys think versus how girls want to think guys like this think","807":" a very lucid and yet humorously handled it has to be given its nature story of the relationships of a budding hack in new york city nat is an upcoming writer who thinks hes landed it big once a geek he now has women at his feet themselves aspiring to be with him and be part of his life and why not the main protagonist is someone with narcism at first charming his lovers and then dropping the more vulnerable ones like house bricks particularly the ones who can give him nothing as he moves on up we can't help but feel disdain for this man and his need for constant stimulation and boredom with anything and everything and his attempts to escape himself with his unconscious workaholism and perfectionistic tendencies yet at the same time we see that he is attracted to insecure women because he has to feel superior in any way he can we see that he eventually comes to dislike this insecurity in the partners he chooses seeing neediness in them ridiculing or outright ignoring the attempts at his lovers to try and repair the relationship in their own typically dysfunctional fashion some of them become depressed or alcoholic or use drugs in order to cope or numb their own feelings which nat then comes to hate and see as pathetic and use as evidence that they were no good and choose to ditch an interesting look at what could be described as avoidant and pre occupied attachment styles and the skills and awareness people both possess and lack","808":"curious to hear what men think about this book given that the author was a woman","809":"hard to read and enjoy a book when the main character is this much of a self adsorbed asshole","810":"thought i was going to hate this but it was a gently comical uncomfortably realistic depiction of dating in brooklyn","811":"this book was a test for me personally to put aside how i think the characters should act and instead think about how the characters truly perceived each other and themselves it is always interesting as humans the gulf that lies between how we perceive ourselves and how others view the gulf between what we think and what we say the gulf between what we say we want and what we really go after honest and delusional in turns nathaniel p is a terrible person a truly nice person overly sensitive cold loving mean passionate in short nathaniel p is a man a person who think he knows who he is and what he wants but the difference lies in what we read and who is revealed as he himself tells the story if you ever wondered if someone loved you or not read this book if you get frustrated by love and sex read this book get mad get angry just first read it to the end see if you can see where the truth in the characters lie","812":"nearly 5 stars took me about 40 pages to get into it and then i didn't want to stop reading the characters were well developed and i felt that i could have been sitting down in a bar with any of them talking about their lives and relationships","813":"after i finished this book i had the impulse to slap my husband just because he's a guy than i remembered he's awesome and he's nothing like nate so i hugged him instead i can't still believe ut was written by a woman she just nailed it i had to go back to the cover and check a couple of time to be sure i'm definitely going to read more about her because if she can write about a guy so well i can only imagine what she can do with women","814":"i hated this character so much it made it hard to enjoy the book","815":"hard to believe this is a first novel the writing is so controlled and exacting in a really elegant way in a traditional comedy of manners way such acute observations of brooklyn intelligentsia and all the associated pretension and what a smart comment on the tired misogynist view on women's writing i love a book that manages to be moral without being priggish or resorting to caricatures","816":" i read this on the recommendation of the new yorker and let me tell you that was a mistake this is a woman's reactionary version of dick lit or lad lit about a poor misunderstood creative man who doesn't you know want to commit and women are crazy and always getting in the way of his productive drive you know so in parodying a genre waldman has actually just expertly recreated it in exactly the same way with characters almost completely lacking in self awareness and the entire patriarchal literature status quo maintained i hated nathaniel but i wasn't a big fan of hanna either someone could read this as a triumph for women but it's just too good at being what it is to actually be subversive in the slightest and yes i realise i'm saying this as a man so feel free to discount my review","817":"more like 3 5 stars for me the main character is a writer and attended harvard and though the book isn't in first person the author seems to really use extravagant vocabulary at times not in the dialogue which i enjoyed because it seems to really fit how the character would talk and sets the tone overall of the mindset she wants the reader to have i mentioned it to a friend and she said thank god for the kindle app i have to agree because i used the dictionary quite a bit it was helpful to be able to just click on a word there's a part where the author describes the demise of nate's relationship with his college love she lays it out so well and in a way that i could relate to big time step by step seeing how resentments build and how you totally can flip what you used to like about someone into now how you see this is a thing that makes it all no longer work for you i looked up the author halfway through the book and was a little surprised to see it was a woman i thought she wrote nate really well he was relatable and not completely unlike some of my guy friends that i talk relationships with the sometimes conflict i've heard men have with wanting to focus on looks even when they don't feel the substance there with a woman the chase the dead space when a chase feels over the excitement when a woman pulls away and now they want her back this was all present here and it's something i've heard plenty of from male friends over most of my life the relationship we see the most of is nate and hannah i was pretty into it i do appreciate that the author goes into a very intimate space with them and it's nice because i wasn't expecting it it's not revolutionary but it did surprise me she totally flips hannah's character for me and i can relate i feel like i've done things in a relationship that no one would expect from me just from the paranoia i've felt at times so i enjoyed that portrayal the book went in and out for me but overall i really liked the writing just a solid relationship fiction book no big climax no big discoveries no real alteration in the main character at all for me you can see how his life is going to go if he never does anything to circumvent it which is fair and normal good read","818":" if fiction is ultimately supposed to accomplish interiority let's start there anyways love affairs is hitting for average basically out of the gate extraordinary command of the written language fielding makes this a two tool novel at least i could keep going with this fractionally baked 5 tools metaphor 'symbolism' was getting ready to make an entrance as hitting for power and maybe 'narrative structure' running speed but basically what i am trying to convey is that this is a really really good novel about relationships also i think i got most of the jokes although i did have to google the bernhard p 29 reference the pull quote from ben kunkel on the back calls love affairs a novel of 'twenty first century manners' by which i think he means 'it's about dating and love and the predilections of carroll gardens brooklyn but it's super well done and there's lots of insight ' if you were looking for weaknesses here one could certain make an obscene hand gesture and comment about south brooklyn's navel gazing fascination with a tired set of upmarket white people concerns which waldman herself seems to feel a bit uncomfortable with at times but i actually think that would be unfair write what you know after all and waldman manages to spend 240 p in the territory of feelings and guys and bodies without ever once veering off into bad sex writing or supermarket aisle women's magazine copy lose 10 pound in 10 days on our super summer diet if you think that's easy try doing it","819":"i loved this book i think waldman created a really vivid and accurate character in nate and in a lot of ways i felt like i was reading into the minds of many men i've dated it was enjoyable thought provoking and at times upsetting but all around a great read","820":"nate's life is not that interesting not sure why i chose to read about him for 300 pages","821":" i never write reviews bc my opinion will always differ from someone else's i feel long as you enjoy a book what's it matter if i do but outside of the fact that the female author was able to so convincingly portray nate to almost fool you into thinking this was written by a male i have no other opinion of this book approximately halfway through i realized there was no plot line anymore and the story was never going to reach a point i stuck with it though because i always feel like i've commited this much time might as well finish it i can't leave a book unfinished when i made it to the last 50 pages i stopped reading and started skimming when i reached the last 20 i stopped skimming and started reading the first 3 words of every paragraph i just wanted it over by the time i was able to say i was done i was also able to say i was right the book didn't amount to anything no unique insightful thoughts no ah ha moment even with books i've hated i've seen the point behind them but with this i was actually left thinking what was the point of this what was the point of this entire book to me worthless waste of time","822":"i listened to this on audible and liked it it's really impressive slightly uncomfortable when an author of the opposite sex no less creates a protagonist that's very similar to you and then sets up that character for ridicule","823":" my biggest qualm at the end of the day is that the book has a perfunctoriness towards the end there is a sense that nate has emerged unscathed and his life goes on nearly unaware of the trouble left in his wake of course that could be said about most of us but our lives like nate's continue on it's hard to find a satisfying 'ending' when the story keeps going after the book is over but if the book finishes not unlike the hannah nate love affair isn't that also an interesting authorial trick plus you're not reading this book for the ending you're reading it for the writing for the incisive social commentary and for the delightful sense of spending a bit of time inside the head of someone who probably seems not unlike somebody you know more at raging biblioholism http ragingbiblioholism com 2014 02","824":"a very quick engrossing read following the love life of a jaded brooklynite an insightful look into the mind of what it is like to be a young professional looking for love in nyc while the book isn't especially thematically rich and the protagonist is at times overly self indulgent accurately depicting modern day greenpoint yuppie'ism it's still a fun read for those interested in love and life for today's youth","825":"nate the worst or the absolute worst","826":"i liked the book but thought nate was a prick oh well extremely well written","827":" i found it interesting as a girl's attempt to get inside a guy's brain heart after all don't we all want to know what our dates partners think generally and of us guess what my worst suspicions were confirmed ha ha i was unable to identify with any female characters though or like them well to an extent the second last relationship scenario felt familiar and no one should be to blame but i do always take the side of a losing team jedem dad seine i like the idea that everyone gets to find their soulmate in the end","828":" in spite of all the positive attention this book has garnered since it's publication it seemed rather shallow and entitled to me the romantic travails and missteps of a privileged harvard educated protagonist amidst an environment of a yuppy brooklyn literary elite just didn't elicit much sympathy from me most of the characters in the book aside from the protagonist and hannah seemed like ill defined shadows that floated in and out as plot devices it took effort to detect any significant depth of character in spite of nate's problems there was no real misery and scant character development nate didn't really go through a journey of transformation characters didn't mature or learn or evolve i would have written a longer book review but i thought the new york times review summed it up adequately in a way \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" is as gentrified as the swath of brooklyn it depicts so well it's small and specific drained of history and ethnicity attendant to the pangs of its social conscience but committed still to its fascination with the well being of those who have already won","829":"i related to this a lot very modern take on the dating world from the male perspective the male narrator is a jerk but at least he is aware of that quality","830":"nate is the kind of nice guy asshole who hides behind a carefully cultivated veneer of intellectualism to disguise how vile he actually is he has a lot of thoughts about the women in his and relationships and some career stuff and that's basically what happens in this book the examination of his character and the social circles he inhabits was vaguely interesting but not enough to sustain a whole book the writing was ok i guess but pretty clinical so many times i found myself thinking oh i see what you did there writer the jokes were so on the nose it was painful hipsters like kale observations about over priced jokes and mom jeans nothing truly insightful or witty and despite all that by the end of the book i still didn't get the point unlikeable main characters are not a deal breaker for me but something about highlighting a gross person like nate and quietly indulging this privileged self absorbed set leaves a bad taste in my mouth he should have been the butt of the joke but i kind of feel like the joke was actually on whoever reads this","831":" this was easy to read some good insights about how a certain type of youngish literary brooklyn type male thinks realistic interior life of the main character quite funny and telling at times but as the main character was trivial and self obsessed so this book came off as being exactly the same i finished it thinking did any of that stuff really matter and i think the answer was no it was quite depressing to think that people like nate actually exist and i guess they probably do superficially thoughtful liberal post feminist right thinking men who if you scratch the surface a bit are unbelievably shallow and sexist with a kind of consumerist approach to women nate does not grow or gain any insight as the book goes on and there is a real lack of humanity or empathy in him all the people he knows are only relevant in relation to how they make him feel so it was pretty wearing to be in his head for the entire novel it does deserve three stars for being well written and a good character portrait if ultimately a bit meaningless","832":"waldman is an excellent writer i enjoyed this book thoroughly but i kept wondering if you aren't familiar with the new york literati set do you need a translator","833":" i'll start with this book's sole redeeming quality it had some eloquent turns of phrase semi redeeming quality #2 it was the selection of a book club which invited me in just a few days after moving to a new city their enthusiastic and welcoming embrace almost made up for their book selection i think the point of this book was to get inside men's brains and see what they really think as they're going through the modern day ritual of dating the problem though is that i don't read to experience the reality of every day i read to learn depth or nuance or novelty sometimes i read to escape all that to me this was like reading a screenplay of the every day 20 somethings and their dating excursions in a big city i found it shallow and frustrating as i wanted so badly for it to go beyond what i experience and instead reveal some extraordinary insights","834":"loved the book nate taught me many things about myself and that is all one can ask of a work of fiction","835":" i know nathaniel priven i've dated nathaniel priven like hannah i loved him then i hated him then time passed and we reached that camaraderie where we can share that grim joke i saw myself reflected a bit in elisa a bit in greer a lot in hannah while reading at times i really wanted to smack nate others i really liked him so i'm not entirely sure did i like this book did i hate it and if i hated it is it because it rang too close to home i don't know maybe i'd be better off reviewing this after i've had a few days to digest it all i guess the point it that human relationships are odd sometimes they work and others not so much the jist is it usually has nothing to do with what one or the other person does or doesn't do on the writing itself i found it funny how at one point nate comments on aurit's way of saying things like it's the absolute truth and people kind of going along with it but the author does this throughout the whole book her characters are all very enthusiastic about their opinions and people arguing with them tend to end up agreeing albeit not always there's little to no room for debate so i liked it and i didn't i wanted to read it til the end and then i had to put it down because i was fed up with nate it's an odd feeling when asked to describe what i was reading the best i could come up eith was that it was like seinfeld a book about nothing combined with bridget jones diary if she were a 'he' however it may be read maybe you know a nate too or maybe you are him either way you'll be entertained","836":"i did not like this book suffered through the whole horrible thing","837":" if i wasn't so utterly convinced that this book was meant to be satirical i would give it 1 star and i think a lot of people did misinterpret this book i did at first as well nate is embodiment of all the fears women have about men he is shallow moody and perpetually unhappy claiming to want this but in actuality really wants that he criticizes girlfriends for unflattering jeans a little arm jiggle for being too girly or not feminine enough he is a fickle jerk who consistently convinces himself that he feels so much but chickens out the moment the woman in his life asks for his feelings to be vocalized he makes completely blanket statements about women and their intentions in careers relationships and goals but allows a pass to his equally douchy male friends who make the same overarching conclusions about the female gender he will blatantly check out a woman in front of his so but becomes pissy when in that same conversation the girlfriend tunes out when he starts talking about literature and brings it up with a very i'm a guy that's what i do but you how dare you not listen to me when i'm speaking nate is every asshole i dated between the ages of 18 to the present he takes many of the worst qualities of my ex boyfriends and rolls them up into an equally intolerable ball of insecurity and narcissism this book was infuriating but i think that was the point as this book is coming from a female author i can imagine it was written as a field guide of sorts ladies nate is a guy that you will date when you're looking for your partner your one your almost one whatever in fact you'll probably end up dating dozens of guys that exude the same self centered overly critical of you eye that nate does hell make these people more impoverished and lost career wise and this was my life at 22 pretty clearly from the way that the character makes me seethe every time he was annoyed that his girlfriend invited him to brunch or how he hated the way she had throw pillows or how his wandering mental eye made me uncomfortable at pretty much any point in the book is a clear show that adelle waldman is a talented writer the book features more vignettes into a life more than an overarching story but i feel like that might even be more true to how life is sometimes relationships don't have a climax and the resolution end can be less then spectacular the only reason i'm not giving this book 5 stars is because it did almost too good of a job of making me hate nate that i can't bear to give his imaginary self the benefit of highest praise yes that is how much of a giant dick this guy is as far as waldman goes i look forward to her next release i know there is a sequel which views the events of the book from the eyes of aurit the only woman in nate's life that can stand him mostly because she had the wherewithal to avoid anything romantic with him but i don't know if i even want to look at this guy again nate is a character i am glad to leave behind and one that i hope i won't have to encounter in my dating life again he is pre millennial entitled masculine ass masquerading as a sensitive and profoundly deep soul but as we can see from his internal monologue and the way he is painted by waldman that this is all a lie and a damn good one","838":" how does she do it adelle waldman enters the mind of the harvard educated self involved overly critical nathaniel p with uncanny ease as a 20 and 30 something living in nyc i desperately wanted to understand the internal workings of such witty young men reading nathaniel p was a deeply satisfying experience i was v wrapped up in the story which is beautiful rendered i could almost smell the air in the brooklyn dive bars if you're interested in the culture literary brooklyn and why smart men cast aside so many worthy and extraordinary women read this book","839":"well written and fascinating you'll see yourself your best friends that girl who looks like a hot mess and it's a shame and the horror that it is all pretty much inescapable","840":"one of my favorite books in 2013 perfectly captures a certain type of guy with a certain set of biases he may seem innocuous but his way of thinking is insidiously misogynistic and far too prevalent throughout literature academia and brooklyn","841":"it was very uncomfortable because it rang so true i'm very impressed with waldman's ability to capture a male perspective an uncomfortable and engrossing read","842":"i mostly finished this book just to finish it felt like a he's just not the into you for the literary crowd i'm afraid to find even a little bit of myself in nate but as a 20 something dating in brooklyn there's inevitably some connection there","843":"i'm not quite getting people who describe this book as a modern austen yes it is a wry look at dating customs and the unspoken undercurrent of meaning of the felt but the unsaid that exists in the mating dance of many overeducated urban young people but with austen at least there was some delicious levity and sparkling dialogue and the pleasure of spending time with sympathetic characters such as lizzie or emma or the dashwood sisters in this book it is like being in the brain of wickham if wickham wasn't an out and out cad but rather was more of an introverted self described intellectual who went to harvard and thinks of himself as a feminist who values smart and dynamic women but who is indeed wickhamish in his self indulgent way of believing he is a victim of others' unreasonable expectations for him and that this sense of being vaguely wronged justifies congratulating himself on having scruples but allowing himself to cast aside such scruples in pursuit of his own easy pleasures and then there is the pain of watching the women nate interacts with willfully subjecting themselves to not saying for fear of looking like they want to be in a committed relationship with open communication even though that is exactly what they want it makes me think of that second section in gone girl where amy's diary recounts this exact bind that so many women find themselves in it's a dynamic that is all the more cringe worthy to read because it does indeed exist but in both gone girl and in this book it exists among a certain brooklyn literary type and the way this world is portrayed makes it very difficult to muster up sympathy for any of the characters i recently finished the book interviewing david foster wallace although of course you end up becoming yourself a road trip with david foster wallace in which dfw explains that he moved back to illinois to write because he wanted to avoid such a scene in austen's england her heroines could not make the choice to leave the constrictions of their social conventions but all the characters in nathaniel p have chosen to put themselves into literary brooklyn which makes empathy for their travails much harder to come by","844":"fresh and true brilliantly captures the essence of a milieu a time and a place literary present day brooklyn i didn't like nate and i loathed his friend jason but i learned a lot by reading this book","845":"in places the work is poignant but it never breaks through its own self consciousness to do anything profound it's too subtle to be enlightening for men who are similar to the titular character and too removed to be meaningfully cathartic for women who have dated men like him a noble attempt a book that needed to be written for our generation but lacking in emotional complexity","846":"the main character nate has to be one of the most despicable boyfriends in the history of contemporary fiction but what made me like the book is waldman had me thinking over and over again that maybe he wasn't so despicable you could almost feel like you were one of his girlfriends convincing yourself that the guy wasn't such a complete jerk waldman does an admirable job of showing how people can appear to be and think they are decent the number of justifications we give for our own and other's behavior is evidence of just how much we want to think a friend or our self is decent but merrily wreck havoc everywhere they go","847":"i kinda liked this book but can't come up with a reason why read it","848":"3 5 stars i blasted through it and though my relationship is infinitely more functional than any portrayed in this book at a few points i recognized behaviors and interactions between nate and his lovers that i have engaged in on the regular namely are you mad at me","849":"it was my turn to pick the next selection for my mommy u0026amp me book club and i was having difficulty choosing i thought some element of randomness might be fun so i asked my mom to choose two letters of the alphabet i received \"w\" and \"l\" in response so i drove to my local barnes u0026amp noble and with the excitement of a kid hunting for easter eggs i dashed to the fiction section and found authors whose last names start with \"w\" running my index finger along the lip of the shelves i scanned the book titles and stopped on the first one that started with \"l\" the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman i believe i uttered an audible \"ugh\" the marketing blurb on the back of the book would have inspired me to put the book back on the shelf t\"for every woman who's ever wondered by he didn't call and every man who has felt guilty - but not guilty enough - about not calling\"good grief no thank you i nearly put it back on the shelf and went for the next title mom would never know right but no i had decided to try a somewhat random title and so it would have not have been right to reject this book when i returned home i started reading immediately i knew if i didn't my initial reticence would result in me putting off reading for days or weeks i found the story of nate piven's dating life not quite to my taste but i loved adelle waldman's prose she is insightful with an erudite vocabulary and though i found the titular character unpleasant and often offensive i found myself grudgingly agreeing that waldman accurately wrote nate to behave and think the way many not all men do i would like to believe i am a better man than nate but as i reached the halfway point of the story a long look in the mirror forced me to admit to myself that i have committed some of the same relationship crimes that nate does while this made for an unpleasant moment i found it cathartic we never like to admit when we are wrong but as long as we learn from the experience even the bad can be put to good use a cause of much eye rolling on my part is that it seems nate lives in a world populated exclusively by attractive women i suppose this can be explained away by saying nate only remarks upon the ladies he finds \"doable\" but i grew tired of every female character in the novel being considered a sex object of some kind this is likely ms waldman's point isn't it there is good reason #yesallwomen exploded on twitter in the summer of 2014 in fact this novel appears to be a vessel for modern social commentary and that is what interested me most while i was irritated envious that nate was constantly surrounded by beautiful and sophisticated people their conversations were my favorite parts of the book waldman's characters felt real and their discussions sounded similar to the ones my friends and i occasionally have i wanted to dive into the page and join in the chatter so story not so much but a huge yes for waldman's style and characters such that i am going to keep an eye out for her work in the future this is her debut novel with no word yet about her second but she has penned articles for several publications so i am going to hunt those down until her next book is published mom felt much the same way about the book as i do even as far as having an uncomfortable moment when she realized that she identified with one of the characters i'm pleased that our experiment of selection worked out this time","850":"better and lighter than other books of the new yorkers behaving badly genre see the unpossessed and the corrections i could stomach finishing this one the title character is still a douche and a twit but neither he nor the book makes the reader suffer the relentless snark of the more typical frantzen esque novel","851":"i don't even know where to begin i couldn't tell you the point of this book it was like his diary of things that happened but no purpose or takeway don't waste your time","852":"oh my god i think i understand a particular obviously caricatured and exaggerated here type of men now valuable perspective on relationships dating and imagination vs communication laughed and almost cried and learned as much from the characters' inner monologue actions as my responses to them recognition concern sometimes relief a bit torn on whether this is required reading in helping people recognize counterproductive patterns or harmful meme normalizing this behavior which i would sum up as unwillingness to communicate or maybe assume instead of asking i think it's ultimately better to read it one reason this book resonates so deeply is the unflinching portrayal of how we construct mental models of each other in a relationship and then fail to help each other update them mental models based on reality but also on past relationships relevant social tropes archetypes fantasies fears wants circumstances etc if we don't communicate directly and honestly about these models and their interaction it's really hard to build a sustainable system perhaps the most harmful meme is that mystical omitted happily ever after if it were meant to be love a lasting relationship it would just magically work with no adjustments or challenges or feedback or conversation about how why conversely if you have to talk about the relationship or your feelings explicitly that kills the romance feelings we have so many stories examples of the pursuit the game the conquest of love and so few of how to make it stay https www goodreads com quotes 440 communication is definitely necessary","853":"i skipped the last 20 pages cause i was over it the first chapter was great but the rest of the book was boring","854":"i've been trying to figure out how to best articulate my feelings about this book at first i was just trying to decipher the point of the book then as i reflected on specific passages and incidents i started to feel angry then i remembered how this book was written by a woman and things started to make more sense i needed to try to explain to myself why this book was so successful i can only assume that this book serves as some sort of justification for women all over to realize it's not you it's me nate is such a two dimensional uninteresting character but my dislike for him is multidimensional i suppose that's the reaction waldman was looking for","855":"this book centers around the brooklyn literary scene and is waldman's debut novel i don't have a high tolerance for smug womanizing morons who always manage to land on their feet and excuse away their failings however the book is a very well written character study that kept me engaged throughout although i'm glad i'm past dating it is a book to avoid if you are easily annoyed by unlikeable characters","856":"i kind of loved this i know i should mock the hipsterdom of it all but i believed the characters","857":" reading this made me feel sad angry and uncomfortable which is a kind of triumph i liked reading this enjoyed it and would even recommend it to friends cautiously like gone girl i worry that this book could in the wrong hands turn into some kind of \"women are crazy\" manifesto the damning parallels that underscore nate's selfishness his mother justifying her life by comparing it to the lives of vapid hypothetical other women nate propping himself up with comparisons to vague other guys dwelling on hannah's drunkenness glossing over his own excesses when hannah bores him it's reasonable when she is bored it's rude can be blunt and heavy handed though in a way this reassures me that it will at least not be misunderstood the characters do not feel especially real at least i hope they're not the new york literary scene can't actually be that pretentious judgmental and two faced... can it but the emotions and mental gymnastics nate goes through feel very real impressively so there's a kind of jokey mathematical proof that ends up showing that 1 1 1 watching nate slide oh so reasonably from one contradictory thought to another is fascinating and just like these \"proofs\" rely on concealing some sort of illegal operation with mathematical sleight of hand nate's self congratulatory logic only functions thanks to the quiet removal of human empathy from the equation there's not much in the way of plot moving essentially from one conversation to another some of the thesis is explicitly state at times overall i'd say my main complaint is the heavy handedness and my main praise is that waldman totally nailed a lot of the interactions and emotions she describes the blunt preachiness is kind of redeemed by the ambiguity of the ending","858":"i read the book straight through and did enjoy the story line although i found the characters highly neurotic","859":"nate's kind of a dick but aren't we all","860":"i didn't take to this book at all and did not finish it reminded me of nick hornby's books though so if you enjoy those this will be for you","861":"hilarious satire fun characters but not much in the way of plot or resolution i was hoping for some growth in the mc's character but this read like an extended albeit brilliant character sketch good beach book","862":"horrifying and fantastic perspective i've never ever read before","863":"i loved this book i didn't entirely expect to although i'd heard great things about it there is something so fundamentally frustrating and irritating about the main characters that i wasn't sure i could take it maybe it hit too close to home adele waldman has done an incredible job portraying the eminently intellectual knowing attitude of a certain type of person while still making it very clear that they lack a basic honest understanding of themselves strongly recommended","864":"full of simple yet sophisticated observations about young life and love melancholy without being depressing clever without being pretentious really enjoyed this one","865":" more like 3 5 stars i like that a female author wrote from the perspective of a male while reading i thought about my dating life though i never dated someone from the literary circle i thought about how the guys acted and how i acted sometimes i thought i sounded like hannah greer even nate nate makes women seem awful emotional and nervous if things go wrong or they imagine it hannah ms know it all like aurit flighty but sexy and cries a lot greer cool but really needy elisa the males are jerks nate and jason but admittedly so like it's cool to be jerks and this is how males are but portraying the females as how they are needy emotional etc just gives guys nate a headache not much actually happens except for descriptions of how past relationships went kristen and elisa to how they are going after the more details of hannah's relationship i felt like i was experiencing it with nate the later parts with greer disappointed the summary felt too packaged up and i didn't really understand why he liked her so much nate is a jerk and it was frustrating to read how he would treat hannah and at the same time she was frustrating too they both were too afraid to say what was really on their mind although nate is seriously superficial for someone approaching 30 you would think he would be more mature but based on my single friends' dating stories this is mostly like true overall i enjoyed this book i thought it was a fun easy to read contemporary book on dating now however for a book published in 2013 some things seemed dated or wrong 1 nate and hannah called each other a lot sorry but it's mostly texting 2 nate was surprised one of his friends wanted to try online dating that's the norm now 3 amy high school crush heard that brooklyn is cool now everyone all rich wall st mba types live in brooklyn now","866":"i imagine this is what lenna dunhams social circle is like the non fun parts of it anyway nat is a frustrating but relatable character in that he chooses not what is best for him but what is easiest sad","867":"a lot has been made of the author's attempt to write a convincing male character delving deep into what men really think about women and how they navigate relationships after a promising start i thought nate devolved into a cliche of a immature jerk practically a monster at times he was so unlikeable by the end i found the novel hard to finish i had no sympathy for him and while i don't think he was meant to be likeable i don't think she intended for him to despicable i think she wanted him to be complex but really he was just one dimensional and predictable i did like the brooklyn setting and the modern take on a novel of manners among the hipster set","868":"one of the best books i've read all year great perspective on modern relationships","869":"i liked this one so much better than most of the young man finding love in brooklyn books i've read tried to read she hits a nice balance where you can understand why nathaniel acts the way he does but you can also tell the author doesn't endorse it","870":"there are far too many books and i am only granted so many readable hours on this earth i really need to get better at just quitting rather than investing miserable time with miserable books i read so many reviews of this book people said it was a realistic portrait of the inner workings of a mans brain and what was miraculous is that it was written by a woman a woman with a keen eye for viewing females through a man's perspective the only thing i could think the entire time i was reading was oh god i hope not first i don't think men are as pretentious arrogant egocentric and dreadfully dull as nathaniel p second women are not as vapid as those created by the author i don't know what sort of men this author has dated or what sort of women this poor author has chosen to surround herself with that gives her such a spot on perspective but generally i think these characters are outliers in my world anyway women have more to offer than their appearances and how they fit into a man's life so that his friends approve men have more to offer than their smug ivy league educations and oxford shirts this author was praised for her writing but i just found it dreadful at one point she interrupted the flow if you can call it that of the plot however dull to state that oh yeah so and so had just bought a drink and is now stabbing the straw down into the ice i stopped re read that and then thought how does this contribute to the plot you only have so many words and so much time to capture a reader and you chose to tell me this when i finally quit around page 130 i had was on page 4 of a 6 page internal monologue about yet another one of nate's past girl friends and all the things she lacked in personality intelligence and charm i don't like to give up on a book especially when i had already invested so much time but i just couldn't take it i didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them frankly if they all threw themselves from the brooklyn bridge it would have been a relief i seem to be in the minority of people who didn't like this book but i just couldn't like anything about it perhaps i missed some amazing character development and plot twist that would have turned this book around for me and i missed it because i couldn't finish","871":"i did really like this book it was well written and had a great sense of place like a walking tour through new york city was an extra bonus that adelle waldman added in for us as a treat i did not like nathaniel p nathaniel p was aggravating in the extreme he was self absorbed and actually a bit frightening on each page i'm not sure if i would suggest a 20 30 year old female friend read this book or not it might give her a perspective on how a man's mind is supposed to work according to this author or it might confirm that she would be better devoting her life to good books travel awesome nights at the theatre and a home decorated exactly as she wants this book does not make you feel like you want to spend time with nathaniel p or anyone remotely like him a cautionary tale it has a great time capsule feeling to it like next year this book will seem like it is dated exactly when it was written and couldn't be read without remembering the year 2014 so i liked adelle waldman's method of telling the story and she absolutely created a fully fleshed man that i grew to dislike so much that i read to the end hoping that something bad would happen to him and that he would somehow be smacked by cosmic justice i had very strong feelings throughout the book and look forward to reading the next thing waldman writes but i hope i never have to meet nathaniel p again and if you meet him walk away that guy is just not worth your time this book is","872":"at times wanted to reach into the book and slap nate made me remember some of my more depressing years of dating guys who were likely having the same thoughts as nate","873":"one of the most difficult things for an author to do in my opinion is to write a believable protagonist of the other sex to do so well in a debut novel display great prospects for waldman as an upcoming writer i tend to be a sucker for contemporary literary fiction so i was the intended audience for a book such as this unlike many reviewers i'm not as harsh towards nate he's certainly flawed but to label him a cad as many have reveals more about the reviewer than it does the character in my opinion it may not have been waldman's intention but a critical lens was cast upon modern relationships as much as it was on nate it's a novel begging for a gender studies analysis but hopefully not just a feminist one ultimately nate's failures reside in his inability to recognize that the feminist fantasy of the male that he is wanting to become is just as impossible to achieve as the male barbie fantasy and the fact that he can never let go of either fantasy","874":"almost impossible to put down adelle waldman is a literary talent to watch","875":"i loathed every single pretentious hipster character but i couldn't stop reading about their ridiculous first world dilemmas and spats i think that may have been the author's intention","876":"add this to the list of first world problem novels come on successful ivy educated writers who have oh so much time to get coffee go to yoga drop the names of philosophers they've read meet for brunch and think their relationships to death could at least one of these self indulgent people volunteer for meals on wheels for god's sake","877":"self absorbed arrogant nathaniel p reflects on his ex girlfriends his current girlfriend the women he wishes he could do the writing is terrific but the subject matter i have a hard time understanding why this is on so many best books of the year lists","878":"i love you adelle waldman i love you so much you nailed the pretentious messed up harvard intellectual who thinks he's hot sh t i loved to laugh at him to despise him to judge him so much fun to judge a character because it's just not cool to judge a live walking pia","879":" oh boy do i have feelings about this book but i'm meant to this book was written to be a conversation starter or ender full disclosure i live in brooklyn and i'm trying to be a writer in case you didn't know that's the one line description of the characters in this book they also find dating fraught and difficult so do i this is how you know whether you should keep talking to someone once they bring up this book if they say i thought it was unfair to men women you're done because they weren't paying attention this is a book about how hard it is to justify your actions to yourself whether you are male or female nate is a smart guy who is on his way to becoming a successful writer and all he wants is a girlfriend or he sort of does he keeps his feelings secret from himself and likes to ignore the worst parts of his character waldman pulls off a very neat trick here she shows us nate's action through a close third person but when she shows us how they affect the people around him we see him in a different light he might think the way people respond to him is irrational but we get to make up our own minds so this book is kind of a fluff book it doesn't take that long to read and it's about dating i found myself nodding along with it at times because i'm a girl in a man's world and feel that i've been treated poorly by men but then i got mad at myself for nodding because sometimes i'm a jerk too the point here is that even if this novel seems like a fun silly read it's ultimately about how we see ourselves and the different angles we'll place the mirror at to avoid changing it","880":"didn't love it maybe just too much dislike of the lead character","881":" http setinmotion1 wordpress com the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman is kinda like a modern day high fidelity except with books instead of music and instead of the wonderfully lovable john cusack we have nathaniel a 30 year old literary yuppie whom you want to slap in the face with a chair set in present day but with multiple flashbacks love affairs tells the story of nathaniel a 30 year old who has had his first taste of literary fame as he remembers past relationships and why they went wrong the beginnings of a relationship with hannah a woman described as 'smart and nice' or 'nice and smart' makes nathaniel question whether he is the 'relationship type' nathaniel is essentially a 21st century knob he and his friends are the typical middle to upper middle class type of adults who believe that the less 'mainstream' you are the better after all it isn't enough to be smart attractive and successful but you have to be interested in obscure music literature and film to really belong part of me wanted to be part of nate's circle of friends if only to discuss some of the wonderful ideas and theories that they discuss i'm always up for a bit of philosophy politics and i definitely enjoy having a chinwag with someone else about great literature yet...as the novel went on i realised that nate and his friends hide behind this facade to show that perhaps they aren't very nice people while it may come across as sophisticated to talk about existential and racialism would you really want to hang out with people who are 'above' discussing mainstream culture what's been happening with your family or even you know shoes i love shoes would you really want to be friends with people who judge you for reading dan brown if so enjoy being surrounded by wet blankets before i read this book i noticed that most of the reviews on goodreads were either two or four stars with many arguing that they just couldn't stand nate which i completely understand nate is a white middle class male who believes he understands the ramifications of a sexist society yet refuses to let his girlfriend know what he is thinking because he is annoyed that her self doubt makes her unsexy he feels terrible about all the disadvantaged and homeless people living in his neighbourhood but does nothing to help their situation in short nate is a self absorbed twat in saying that i loved reading this book partially because it was so accurate yet so chilling considering that it is written by a woman i became totally absorbed in reading about nate and his awful yet interesting friends and much as i hate to admit it i think it's because i would be somewhat dazzled by their beauty and intellect would i want to be friends with these people probably not but i enjoyed being in their world for a few hundred pages overall the only criticism i had for this book was the ending - i thought that things turned out too smoothly for nate who had treated the women and the family in his life terribly throughout the entire novel for things to end perfectly with no lesson learnt seemed like a let down if you're into literature high fidelity laughing at pretentious wankers or want to move to brooklyn i'd suggest reading the love affairs of nathaniel p although ironically enough nate and his friends wouldn't be caught dead with a book like this perfect","882":"an interesting concept basically chick lit from the male perspective but written by a woman","883":"well written but i was totally un engaged i also hate nathaniel p real bad","884":"it was okay it seems to be this summer's supposed literary book that is really just a pretty good beach read the characterization is virtually nonexistent reading through the book you will learn nothing more about the characters no one will grow no one will change but it is fine i guess","885":" it is difficult to express enjoyment of this read though i realize my dismay stems perhaps from a flawed confirmation of the behavior of the male species flawed in that this book reads as if granted privileged access to the thoughts and perceptions of nate which i continued to transfer onto partners of the past and perhaps of the future with each page hope diminished continuously only to discover the brutal truth that as trite as this might sound 'it's complicated ' and often times not very pretty waldman's extremely convincing reveal of nate's perspective is a testament to her skill and understanding of human nature which i had to constantly remind myself of while continuing on trying desperately not to confuse my distaste for nate for unhappy feelings for the book itself to hope for a satisfying resolution as to why men and women seem to be akin to the flair of fireworks beginning at the same point yet diverging widely from each other over time is never provided in the way i had hoped in retrospect this makes complete sense in a foolish way i eagerly proceeded thinking nate and hannah would reveal the complicated path to reverse that image and bring forth those divergent streams of light back to the point of origin together full of promise of the beautiful things yet to come yet what hannah and nate reveal is that though sincere love and tenderness for another may exist between two potential mates it is never enough to understand it possibly never will be is a difficult lesson to take to heart in understanding this i ended this book with much respect and admiration for waldman in her confident acknowledgment of ugly truths and behavior which lead us all men and women astray welcoming the comfort of knowing there is always someone else there to help distract or possibly forget all that might be too difficult beautiful lovely and real with another","886":"i liked this one a lot despite because of the not uncommon sting of recognizing garbage things i have said or done","887":"despised every character in the book but a good read nonetheless very similar writing to euginides' the marriage plot and or franzen","888":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm curious if i'm the only person who would compare this book to high fidelity the central relationships and narrative structures are similar in a way besides the endings especially the part where nate phones his vastly different and extremely 2 dimensionally rendered by his character ex girlfriend to navel gaze about his adequacy as a boyfriend i prefer high fidelity i did enjoy the narrative of this book but i believe it's mostly because of its relevance to my life overly educated s i'm curious if i'm the only person who would compare this book to high fidelity the central relationships and narrative structures are similar in a way besides the endings especially the part where nate phones his vastly different and extremely 2 dimensionally rendered by his character ex girlfriend to navel gaze about his adequacy as a boyfriend i prefer high fidelity i did enjoy the narrative of this book but i believe it's mostly because of its relevance to my life overly educated spoiled characters living in south slope sound familiar to anyone that said i'm not sure this novel would hold the interest of those unfamiliar with such a trope there's not enough contained as it feels more like a vignette than a novel the last section of the book about greer is mostly exposition and brought to mind the final scenes of films in which a narrator blathers on as a man drives solo down a sunny road in california i always hate that scene i did think that waldman fantastically deconstructed masculinity especially a certain type of masculinity constructed around subtle misogyny negging and passive aggressive breakups sound familiar to anyone more","889":"main character spends the entire book over analyzing every girl he comes in contact with then becomes overly critical of their flaws normal human flaws nate is a self centered asshole who isn't able to critically look at himself only others","890":" i thought this was all right but i am mystified by the rave reviews it got it did not represent for me as had been suggested by some reviews the second coming of either edith wharton or jane austen entertaining idea with writing that was not painfully bad but no great pleasure to read either it often seemed that the author only reluctantly dragged herself out of nathaniel p's mind long enough to describe the weather his efforts to clean his squalid apartment or an outing to a local restaurant despite its accurate daubs of local color it never came alive i never forgot i was reading a story satire that lacked bite lot of telling and not much showing i was interested enough to keep reading but only mildly concerned with what happened to the self absorbed title character i also had trouble believing he was a novelist which seems strange novelists should of any profession be able to imagine themselves into the brain of other novelists i thought the final insight of the book was depressingly accurate yet a novel in which the main character does not grow or change in any measurable way is not really artistically satisfying whatever claims it might make to realism","891":" an extremely accomplished book about a complete arsehole of a man who is actually fairly typical of most men i've dated depressing stuff best quote to illustrate said contention i feel like you want to think what you're feeling is really deep like some seriously profound existential shit but to me it looks like the most tired the most average thing in the world the guy who is all interested in a woman until the very moment when it dawns on him that he has her wanting only what you can't have the affliction of shallow morons everywhere yep pretty much and in the end he gets together with a woman who he can be in a relationship with because he does not regard her as his intellectual equal quality dude i know so many of them","892":" i kind of don't know why i liked this book it was a rather easy read once i started it i somehow just wanted to get through to the end of it and the protagonist is a huge douchebag who thinks way waaaay too much of himself and his circle of equally pretentious douchebag friends also there's basically no plot and the subject matter his relationships and how he basically ruins them because of petty reasons and his own issues much of them revolving around how amazing he thinks he is because he's educated and likes to read if you choose to believe that people like the characters on this book actually exist and i'm inclined to think they do sadly is rather sad it looks a lot like an episode of some hippy tv series of 20 30's somethings living in new york sex and the city girls idek and screwing up a lot because they don't exactly own up to their choices it leaves you hating everybody and wishing they weren't so dumb and wishing even more that people like that didn't actually exist or at least that's how i usually feel lol and maybe that's how the author wanted it to be feel so yeah since i felt that 3 stars","893":"enjoyable quick read that provided interesting insight into what possibly goes through the male mind when dating i was surprised to see this book from the male perspective was in fact written by a female","894":"this book was a great representation of what it's like to be a late 20's early 30's something man that's single could totally relate to a bunch of the scenarios and troubles that arose great read","895":" the writing is phenomenal no questions there however at times it seemed very obvious that it was a female attempting to write from the perspective of a male there were several phrases such as bosom friend that i don't believe any guy would ever say and yet there it was once you reconcile yourself to that frustration and move on to appreciating the beautiful language and moderately enjoyable story line it becomes much more enjoyable in general the plot was typical and the characters stereotypical of the literary scene it was an easy read though i had to reach for the dictionary more than a couple times","896":" there's a good deal i enjoyed about this book how we talk about our friends' successes and failures when they're not around how we internalize our relationships and often fail to communicate our honest feelings how much of a dick guys are especially powerful were the status update like sentences that showed just how the protagonist was feeling about certain situations when he felt cold toward someone when his mood changed when he grew tired of a conversation it functioned as a nice way of showing just how active his mind was whether or not he was truly aware of what was causing those changes","897":"so there's this guy imagine having to be in his head for almost 300 pages there's a chance it's satire but then he gets an hea read the full review on the random transliterator","898":" i don't really have enough praise for this book it is probably my favorite book i've read this year more on my reading habits this year below and i've loved a lot of books this year oh the interestings and life after life but adelle waldman writes so incisively and with such great wit that her characters especially her bright ambitious and often unlikeable protagonist exist vibrantly in the world of elite literary brooklyn a searing satire that transcends mere snark the love affairs of nathanial p is a jane austen novel for the 21st century nb i debated for a while whether this should count towards books read in 2013 or 2014 i started this on december 29 and finished on new year's day so i'm going to add it to the 2013 pile which means i have to start fresh on my new year's resolution to read 20 novels this year my total for 2013 comes to 17 counting this although that includes some novellas short story compilations and a graphic novel i'm about halfway through anna karenina but i'll count that for 2014 also i've debated whether i should be more or less ambitious than 20 but i would like to get through a few classic novels this year and those tend to take me longer to read","899":"the writing is excellent the content is no cake walk","900":"sharp writing with humor mixed in i questioned whether the author truly got into the head of the male characters there were a few places with poor editing but overall i enjoyed reading this book i stayed absorbed in it and appreciated that the main character stayed who he was throughout the book which was frustrating at times as he definitely still had some growing to do but this was also more realistic","901":"this book irritated me and for that privilege i give it 4 stars i guess if a story is well written enough to elicit any emotion from me that should be recognized i want to write this review without spoilers but that is going to be hard to do nate the protagonist is kind of an every man although he's depicted as more self aware and introspective than most of the men i've known yes i know that was an insult despite his insight he still can't manage to figure out why he likes the women he does consequently neither can we nate is a pretty shallow guy... it seems to boil down to he wants a woman who makes him feel good about himself even if she's not real smart even if she's manipulative and even if she picks fights with him the make up sex is great the conclusion i came to is that nate really wants a woman that he can feel superior to he doesn't want an equal partner or need a woman for intellectual stimulation after all he has his work and his buddies for that throughout the book i just kept thinking... this is how men really think about women and it's horrible no wonder so many of them end up with bimbos no wonder so many of them end up meeting a woman marrying her and buying her a house but to be fair ah shoot i don't need to be fair i thought nate was a total schmuck i'd like to think that nate is not a typical male but sadly i suspect he is to quote ruth bader ginsburg on another topic \"i didn't want to be right but sadly i am \"","902":" the book was honestly like the male version of sex in the city nathaniel recounts all of the women who he's dated before coming to new york city to become a now freelance writer just as his first book is about to come out for about half of the book he is involved with a girl named hannah who seemed to me like a lovely girl but whom he hen picks to pieces trying to find things wrong with her especially in comparison to other women namely those he currently has in his life as platonic friends acquaintances or women who he has previously dated of course they break up and he meddles through why he began a relationship with her at all in fact he does this with all the girls and women he mentions through the course of the book hannah is the only women who seems to have more of a voice than the rest as she lets him have it in a lovely post break up email for which i was proud of her the woman he ends up with i won't spoil it for you was surprising in that he accepts that no woman is perfect or even perfect for him and that's perhaps the author's message here in the adventure that is life one must find someone that challenges a person to see and feel things differently sadly this book did not challenge me","903":" waldman is a good writer and she makes a good exploration of a certain kind of person dick jerk but not much else happens and it's frustrating i did like though that nate's bad behavior made me question some of the things that go on in my own head and the way i think think rationalize my way through being a dick or trying to convince myself it's okay to feel act dickish it's nice to get called out still nate is not a great person to spend time with and since there's so little plot here it's all freaking nate all the time","904":"this book is a quick read but definitely thought provoking the main character as others noted is a complete pratt and yet i never felt that he was a caricature i think i would have found this way too depressing in my late 20s when i was still dating","905":"the recognitionof your insularitydoesn't make dick moves any less dick ish too circuitous though nate what a truly grating name seems privyto a kind of guy talk to which otherfemale voiced males in fiction ex richard in the secret history seem curiously un attuned","906":"meh no particularly new insights few interesting characters of any depth and for all the talk of them being intellectuals none of them actually say much to convince me of this and prose that's nothing to write home about and worst of all it creates absurd male and female dichotomies reinforcing tired gender stereotypes occasionally and only briefly interesting because we do see glimpses of ourselves and our friends in some of the characters","907":" this book really bugged me the cliche that all of the characters are unlikable is often a cop out especially when a book has something more to offer when the personalities of the characters aren't the book's focus when the writer has a comment to make and chooses to use unlikable characters to make her point i was on team claire messud last year but these are the most miserable characters this side of franzen a hodgepodge of unaware brats and status obsessed ivy leaguers an excusable offense were this not merely an ethnography of the love lives of impossibly privileged brooklynites a meandering lifestyle column passing as cutting social commentary like an extra long entry in the new york times style section without any of the ironic pleasure there's not a single decent person in this entire novel and if there's a larger point or if this is supposed to be biting satire of people who ride the f train i missed it if i'm going to spend a few hundred pages reading about the petty problems of spoiled brooklynites i would at least appreciate not hating every single character","908":" i could barely stand most of the characters in this novel especially nate p \"although it wasn't something he'd admit aloud he often though women were either deep or reasonable but rarely both \"\"if nate was honest he also thought that woman as a general category seemed less capable of or interested in the disinterested aesthetic appraisal of literature or art '\"yuck and i don't even want to get into the conversations he had with his friends i believe that the author did accurately capture this brooklyn hip lit world--and she made me very happy to be far far away from it","909":" i don't know why i enjoyed this book so much usually i find books with a storyline such as this incredibly self involved and extremely irritating maybe it was the main character nate wasn't a pain in the arse compared to books i've read of a similar theme with male lead characters this was definitely much better than i was expecting i don't think it's a book for everyone and whilst i'd recommend it i wouldn't recommend it if you weren't a fan of catcher in the rye anthropology of an american girl etc similar books to these genres i'd probably call them the american movement books about teenagers growing up usually always set in new york and always trying to find themselves on some level or another i wouldn't say it's a favourite yet but i think i'd definitely read it again to go back and pick up on the little bits i may have missed the first time around","910":"i thought she did a good job writing in the voice of a man sadly because he is truly not a nice human being but seems to be a true one well written","911":"entertaining look inside the mind of a millennial man","912":"maybe i'm just past the stage in my life where i can tolerate main characters whom i dislike so much maybe it's a tribute to adelle waldman's writing that i so disliked this character ms waldman is a very good writer i hope she writes more","913":"this is a well written and knowing book its vision of contemporary dating is solid if parochial i wonder how much appeal this would have in the slums of cleveland this is why normal folks are more repulsed than laudatory and most of the lauding is coming from frustrated female intellectuals who write book reviews for that reason i despise the argument that this book will help women understand men and dating no this will help you understand why men who are highly sought after ditch women they do so because they have options and can afford to choose this is no great crime in of itself for beautiful women also ditch men who are unworthy of them we the ditched of both sexes feel aggrieved when we have no right to be for the moment the ditched women are given sympathy and the men are called entitled for wanting women out of their league what we fail to see and waldman gets but does not explicate on is that our society is capitalist through and through and all of us are on the meat market and we all estimate ourselves too highly on this market whatever your value is shave of a few pints that is what most others see hannah never had a chance if anything many people saw her within the world waldman builds for it is never said as swimming in waters she was normally banned from waldman thinks that men are less interested in relationships and can fall into them more easily this is flat out wrong most men do not choose their woman it is the reverse most men crave affection and closeness those who do not are like nate he has options and so is more highly prized with many women wanting to be the one who tamed a nate but there is more here for nate is no alpha in the classic sense there are a few lines that stuck out in this regard in particular when nate admits sometimes i think i've lost something some capacity to be with another person something i used to have i feel pretty fucked to tell the truth also he would know with near perfect certainty that there would come a time when he would be feeling down and lonely and crave more than anything hannah's company her warmth her intelligence her humor her ability to understand him on that night as he returned home to his empty apartment he'd regret this day but he also knew that on all the other nights -- the say forty nine out of fifty nights when he wasn't unhappy in that particular way -- he'd be glad to be free of this of the heavy unfun yoke of it this thought made him feel bad all over again what do these mean it means that the past was never really over for nate he could remember the time he was superfluous now he has this power and he lacks experience with it he also can't quit the feeling that the other person is in love with the idea of him and not him the tragedy which waldman sort of missed is that hannah did but it was too late nate is gone lost forever there was a whole world of tragedy there that was left unexplored because we prefer detachment to the emotions that rip through in the work of euripides and keats oh but those grand emotions are returning like barbarians at the gates of rome when they do we will see that we created a desert and called it a sexual revolution enough preaching though this is fine book well crafted perhaps too much so knowing and perfect for our times bravo ps it is rare where i see myself so perfectly in a character or empathize with them to the point of getting them i am not like the hound from a song of ice and fire but i get him nate though is a rare one for me i got him sometimes and sometimes i saw myself in him but what separated us was his vanity and his success i can only understand those in degrees for i too am vain and successful but not to his degree so i felt a mix of understanding and confusion attraction and repulsion that is rare perhaps that is why i cannot be so reductionist as to call this a trip into the male mind anymore than one can do that for the female mind oh the howls one would get for writing that book","914":"i really didn't like this book didn't feel like the main character was human at all also a bit too much details","915":"as a millenial dude doing millenial dating this shit was way too real read up boys and let's not be douches","916":"the third star is for the cover artwork","917":"while it was fun to read a book set in brooklyn this debut novel just made me feel so incredibly lucky not to be a single young woman in new york city","918":" the love affairs of nathaniel p features a very unlikeable protagonist who is surrounded by other largely unlikeable characters there is nothing affirming or positive about what this book has to say about humanity particularly when it comes to romantic relationships but the pathos of the lives of the shallow brooklyn intellectuals depicted is incredibly engaging it is a book in which i found a lot of truth and i found myself able to recognise some of these characters and some of their behaviours the writing is seamless and the voice despite the author being a female writing from a male perspective is strong in short this book is beautifully written cynical honest and completely engaging i loved it and read it compulsively in a day","919":"what awful awful people i'm so glad i'm not young and self important","920":"nate is a twenty something writer living in nyc and he's a self absorbed jerk this is chick lit with a male protagonist that wants to be literary fiction it's overly pretentious just like the goldfinch","921":" notes i wanted to get more out of this lately i'm very interested in unlikeable characters but there needs to be something else to learn from them outside of their unlikeability i liked it inasmuch that i enjoy minutia of people's thoughts but it still didn't amount to very much by way of revelation the book does exactly what it aims to do and that's it the feeling of constructedness of some sequences that other readers complained about is a function of the premise of the book the experience of being in someone's head certain experiences as examples or allegories for how nate the protagonist interprets the other characters the telling instead of showing is also indicative how we interpret what happens as opposed to the experience of it happening does this make for interesting reading not if you're looking for plot or endearing characters this book has a very specific readership either people who may identify with the protagonist or people who identify with the author as someone who has to deal with the protagonist","922":"so funny so clear eyed rip archetype of the brooklyn based male literary genius","923":"highly perceptive novel about well educated young men and the callous ways they can move through relationships even as she indicts waldman can't help but be sympathetic to her characters and the book is better for it as plotless as it is the book keeps your attention through its emotional honesty and sharp details if girls had a male counterpart it might look something like this","924":" adelle waldman has in essence managed to write a 21st century feminist novel about a man while the entire story is seen through the eyes of nate whose recent literary career breakthrough has given him the luxury and leisure to reflect on the meaning of status success and women the most fascinating aspect of this fascinating book is the way that everyone here is a kind of victim of their own script nate is just as desperate to be a good man as his girlfriends want and need him to be and on the surface he even knows what that would require and yet the very privilege that allows him struggle with the issues blinds him to the subtle but inescapable connections between his assumptions and his behaviors the more predictable his excuses the more 'clingy' and stereotyped his girlfriend's actions become providing him further justification for disengagement as readers we don't especially like nate but we can't help but understand him and that is the most powerful and pathetic thing of all","925":"just good fun as i was reading it i wondered if i'd have the fortune of unearthing some relationship revelation but actually it's just kind of like hey guys different things happen it's all good it's all experience and theeeeen and theeeeen nope nothing else just that nbd","926":"i really loved how this depicted modern day dating particularly i enjoyed the detailed description of all of the women in the book nathaniel is the protagonist but it feels like the book is really about all of the women he dates more than it is about him my only dissatisfaction is with the ending of the book it was anti climatic and i felt like i wanted something more but on the other hand it tied in with the rest of the book i just finished the book wanting more","927":"i despised the protagonist of this book so much which makes me think this book is either fantastically written or perfectly dreadful","928":" i really enjoyed reading this book and am still digesting it a day later as someone in a similar demographic as the protagonist nathaniel p it made me question a lot of my perceptions about love and dating at times it was hard to separate my frustration with the characters from the work of the author but once i did i was impressed by how precisely adelle waldman created the world of the novel i don't live in brooklyn and am not in any literary circles so i cannot say if she accurately captured the feel of the place and the people but let's just say that if i ever move to brooklyn it will not be because of this book nathaniel p is objectively intelligent and a good guy unless you've dated him and had to deal with his moods his one track mind and emotional blind spots though nate and his friends are intellectuals their judgments and dating proclivities are similar to everyone else's the book ends on a melancholy note because this mess of petty judgments lust and confused emotions is what dating is all about adelle waldman is married and i wonder if she wrote this book as a way to appreciate her marriage ever so much more","929":"i'm torn between 3 and 4 stars i really grew to hate nate which is a testament to the fact that she can really write a male character","930":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a very interesting look at dating and love in modern day brooklyn yes nathaniel is kind of a self involved asshole but i think everyone has had a relationship that develops like his u0026amp hannah's where it just isn't working and fizzles out i literally could relate to each dating situation in the book to someone either myself or my girlfriends were going through it was great to hear his inner thoughts annoyances and gripes as they happened and as the relationship deteriorated the fact that a very interesting look at dating and

fizzles out i literally could relate to each dating situation in the book to someone either myself or my girlfriends were going through it was great to hear his inner thoughts annoyances and gripes as they happened and as the relationship deteriorated the fact that this book was written by a woman was astounding as i felt it hit the nail on the head with how most men view relationships especially casual ones and how most women sort of hold on and try to make it work even when everyone knows it's not going to more","931":"reprinted from my review in cleaver magazinesuburban mid atlantic

cristina wrote me the other day to say she had received the book she ordered it and read it as soon as i told her about it \"i have your love affairs with me \" she wrote with a wink and smile but the nathaniel in the love affairs of nathaniel p isn't really anything like me i don't go by nate for one--ever since my little league coach called me \"nate the rusty gate\" i couldn't hit --and my peter would never admonish someone for using coarse toilet paper \"just feel it can you believe that this--the world's most diaphanous sandpaper--is what our nate uses to wipe his ass talk about self loathing \" says nate's friend an american studies professor who lives in maine in fact the opposite the real peter a professor of american history can't understand why anyone would use excessively soft and cushioned toilet paper--it's your ass we're talking about i mean come on he is likely to say moreover nate is a kind of jerk and that can't be me right with only vague intellectual interests and almost no passion a loveable jerk well that probably depends on how you take to waldman's dissection of nate's flawed personality particularly his underdeveloped capacity to connect emotionally with women much of the book covers nate's somewhat lifeless relationship with aspiring writer hannah as several previous reviewers have noted waldman is indeed adept at seeing women through the eyes of a 30 year old man particularly one who finds all the pleasure in the hunt and almost none in the act of sustaining love here is nate eying up his previous girlfriend elisa an editorial assistant at a new yorker like magazine her demeanor was smooth and preoccupied even slightly sullen and she spoke at times with an unnerving almost anhedonic lack of affect she often seemed bored this edge of perpetual dissatisfaction made it all the more thrilling for nate when he cajoled her into laughter and good humor to impress her one felt--he felt--was really something as nate floats along this way waldman reveals her keen ability to interpret disjuncture in relationships--particularly within the cloistered demographic of white over educated 25 35 year old writers and editors clambering around brooklyn--and weigh out the unsaid the painful silence that so often pierces intimate conversation for a book that aims to be a summer must read waldman deliberately flaunts the rules of the bestseller there is no plot no inciting action no lofty desire no set back per se just the straight line heartbeat of a small man who likes to get laid this is perhaps what i like most about the book it attempts no resolution nate doesn't change or grow he discovers after all no moral clarity he perhaps loses a bit refreshing this has somewhat been my aim too with the forthcoming novel lion and leopard but the book also lacks pathology there is zero undercurrent nothing that bristles moreover because ultimately so little is at stake hardly anything comes of the love affairs of nathaniel p some of this is attributable to the narrow setting waldman is most certainly part of the brooklyn literary scene that's manifest this last decade and a half and she clearly knows it well her husband evan hughes is the author of the 2011 literary brooklyn the writers of brooklyn and the story of american city life which was also published by holt nathaniel p is deeply absorbed in that unrelentingly aspirational and most certainly claustrophobic world \"the whole publishing industry lives in brooklyn\" where a book contract is the ultimate reward for living everyone is constantly assessing and labeling each other half baked liberal theories much beloved by magazines underlie every conversation and no one ever seems to escape except to live in one or two still uncleansed neighborhoods yet always with an eye on park slope the narrowness in this case is only a problem because it constricts the emotional range of the book waldman a journalist is clear eyed and dead pan in her description of the people and places of literary brooklyn and that tone infects nate's life he evidently lacks imagination for living and he knows it but unless they are drunks or social deviants writers make lousy protagonists after all we don't actually do much but observe read and think--and struggle with our own craft and obsess over exposure it's an unusually internal life--hard to render en vive on the page as i read about my doppelganger a young man with my name who sits at a desk all day as i do hoping to turn words into magic--as much for the self fulfillment of the whole endeavor as to entertain and delight the reader--it was fun to imagine how very very little separates our lives the circle that contains this nathaniel p and that one is pretty narrow indeed though god knows i was curious about those affairs i've been married for 18 years and yet i also kept wondering why nate who left philadelphia where i live for the much wider world of new york never seems to engage in the almost infinite richesse of the big onion i wished to tell him to go out and walk walk endlessly and find himself elsewhere better yet alter ego why not use that six figure advance and go see the world","932":"i know half a dozen nathaniel p's this book hits them right on their selfish little noses i had a love hate thing going with the main character right from the first chapter great read","933":"read this on the basis of some best books of 2013 reviews honestly it was a drag to get through self indulgent u0026amp the milieu observed so narrow narcissistic and self preoccupied what was the point not a good read","934":" i waited to write this review until i was less consumed with low levels of smoldering rage not towards waldman but towards men misandry this is the literary equivalent of misandry cross stitch on etsy waldman is a social commentator both part of and outside the scene and i think there's a telling moment in the book when characters discuss george eliot and middlemarch one of the male characters notable for his emotional attachment to a co worker that he doesn't find hot enough so he won't date her says smart women have a personal stake in vilifying men who fail to appreciate smart women i think waldman writes this line as a bold tongue in cheek stance about the purpose of her book she is our george eliot we are all hannah the plot is irritatingly and i suppose purposefully meandering and the main character the titular nathaniel p is irritatingly meditative on his horrible bachelor apartment and his exhaustive cataloging of each woman's beauty and flaws love affairs of nathaniel p is the lampooning of the 21st century man the post metrosexual post alpha male post swinging dick white dude literature nate is the guy we all hope we can avoid liking if anyone tells you he admires roth as not just a writer but as a role model run in the other direction i can't tell if my criticisms of this book especially the go nowhere plot and excruciatingly slow pacing are the full embodiment of nate's personality or the flaws of a first time novelist i look forward to reading more waldman her capturing of tiny scenes and dialogue are spot on and i hope her next piece is a bit more plot driven but that's just because generally post modern meditative literature isn't my cup of tea","935":"well written and fairly compelling to read but i really hated the protagonist i had a very difficult time identifying with him and his self absorbed sexism","936":" first of all let's acknowledge that the cover is gorgeous it's unique and compelling and calls to potential readers in a way that can be rare in the adult market when compared to ya some designer out there should be patting themselves on the back for this one in an interview i listened to the author described this book as her response to the lack of ways contemporary fiction has addressed the modern dating scene okay i'm willing to go with that although we're presumably talking about fiction that does not fall into the often maligned \"chick lit\" genre i never saw the payoff of this within the novel itself our protagonist nathaniel refuses to have a smart phone there isn't much talk of texting at all the idea of gender dynamics are not explored in a way that feels extremely fresh i did not expect to necessarily like the protagonist of this book i found myself kind of hating him he's a kind of \"can't grow up\" pretentious jerk that justifies it all by his supposed intelligence he lacks an incredible amount of self awareness relationships with women aside at one point he mentions that he is a good friend when one of the major scenes earlier demonstrative of his friendship capabilities involved promising to save a seat for a friend at a reading and then not even trying all other interactions with his \"friends\" seem to be some bizarre competition while he calls out girls on being status seeking or social climbers he remains woefully unaware of the fact that he does the same when the importance of his friends opinions become a one upmanship and after he gets bored he zones in on any flaw in women physical or personality he's smug in his intelligence justifying his ability to write pieces in literary magazines and commentate on social problems while being seemingly isolated from the world i guess my main issue with hating nate so much was that it didn't allow me to challenge anything any ideas or conceptions were overshadowed by the idea that he was a huge jerk i mean seriously how does aurit put up with his stupidity that long term even as a friend although she sums it up pretty perfectly when she tells nate to \"not be an unreliable narrator \" because he is even humbert manages to be disturbingly charming when recounting his pedophilia and this guy can't even properly justify his behavior to me even as he attempts to justify it to himself his supposed guilt does not make anything better at the same time i hated him i recognized at least an honesty in many of the criticisms his conscious voiced that many wouldn't admit to i can't say this novel really bolsters my confidence level in entering the adult dating scene and finding a decent guy out there for a book that clocks in at only 240 pages i had to fight my way through it more than i anticipated","937":" probably more like 3 5 stars part of the issue is that the last few books i've read have been 5 stars all the way so it's hard to rate this one objectively it's also filled with really annoying yet realistic characters like nate in the book at times i had to skim the pages because it was so annoying and uncomfortable but also familiar i've met a few nates in my day and i'm sure you have to i can understand why one reviewer made his daughter read this book though i think maybe young men are really the ones who should read it one thing's for sure reading this will make you happy you're not a hip young brooklyn author if that's what being young and hip is like those kids can have it","938":" this is a great humorous entertaining and very well written book the best parts of course were the awful awful characters chief among them being nate himself when i say awful i don't mean that they were undeveloped or boring i mean that they are odiously pretentious and full of themselves nate and his friends are a group of upper middle class intellectually snobbish hipsters who name drop obscure authors to impress each other and wallow in their obligatory liberal guilt i loved hating them the bulk of the book is about nate's dysfunctional relationship with girlfriend hannah and how he has convinced himself that he never does anything wrong and everything must be her fault he is a complete and total asshole and the worst part is that he really truly feels that he isn't oh nate if only you could see what we see if he were real he would absolutely be the biggest most obnoxious prick ever great book","939":"better than i assumed and in fact quite relatable","940":" this was such an addicting and infuriating read i devoured multiple chapters at a time unable to stop in a nutshell this book gets us in the mind of nathaniel piven who is a self described nice guy who graduated from harvard and is trying to make his way in new york city as a writer nathaniel is immersed in high brow literary culture and considers himself an intellectual who is looking for a quality woman who can match him what he says he wants and what he actually chooses is vastly different the novel opens with him starting the split with his current high maintenance girlfriend whose face is perfection in fact nathaniel feels like he is a winner just being seen with her in public and starting a relationship with a witty intellectual girl hannah who can match him in any argument and makes him laugh things seem to be going well for nathaniel but he finds himself second guessing hannah after all she is only a 7 looks wise and hasn't he worked hard enough to deserve better i was flipping the pages fascinated by his thought process and literary musings hoping that he would push past his issues to make it work with hannah as a woman i have to bring up the fact that being in nathaniel's mind was so interesting because he sounds a lot like the nice smart guys i have dated who have claimed to love how much i read but have broke it off and left me wondering why it's like getting a peek into what might be happening in the mind of the young 20 30 year old male he is kind of a jerk in the ways he treats women but at the same time he really is completely clueless he honestly believes that he is nice guy and not purposely playing emotional games he really doesn't want to hurt women but he does even though some of his thoughts repelled me nathaniel p was also kind of a sympathetic character the quote that hit home with me his relationship had shown him things about himself he wasn't entirely proud of about what he really valued in a woman and what he claimed to value but in fact could live without i don't think this just applies to men don't we all claim we want intellect and kindness but would sometimes trade that in for a good body and cute smile do attractive men and women just have a higher market value in our system today","941":"i had forgotten how fun it is to read a good novel after 2 years of non fiction waldman's book lived up to all the rave reviews i had heard refreshingly honest page turning and unapologetic","942":"this book gives a great insight in what might be going on in a man's mind during a relationship i enjoyed reading the dialogues were great and characters believable","943":"boys are mean","944":"i would have given this book 5 stars except i wanted to see the main character die a horrible death it's very well written and has some amazing insights into human nature especially the nature of assholes","945":"it's been a while since i took so strongly against a book i'd chosen to read this was deeply irritating nate is not just a dull douche he's also a dick and yet i couldn't shake the feeling that the author found him redeemable if only because she built the narrative around his dickishness and while i may be unqualified to judge i found the whole enterprise weirdly misogynist and definitely unpleasant ugh","946":"witty and incisive portrait of the perils of modern dating what drives initial attraction and the differences between who we think we should fall for and who we ultimately do maybe this sounds like a cliche and tired topic but waldman takes a wholly refreshing take seen through the eyes of a liberal elite self involved self sabotaging male in new york its amazing how well waldman a woman is able to reflect a lot of neuroses of single ~30 year old men through his roiling inner dialogue i'd recommend it to anyone","947":"i read over 50 pages and couldn't get myself to go any farther there's nothing to grab the audience","948":"this was one of the most pretencious books i have ever read i had zero interest in nor any affection for any of the characters in the book seriously awful the author appeared to be more interested in presenting herself as among the academically elite using sentences that really felt worked and contrived as she grasped for an air of sophistication the on y reason i finished it was 1 because i'm too ocd about leaving books unread and 2 because i honestly hoped each and every character would face an untimely death that unfortunately didn't happen not a book for me and i have no interest in reading anything further from this author","949":"she loves exposition but doesn't convincingly tell a story","950":" i do not follow the hype of this book i wanted to dump nathaniel after the first page but after sticking with the character on page who i never would have tolerated in life i was understanding nate better by the end i would have dumped all those girls too everyone was annoying i have often felt like the jerk nate briefly recognizes in himself for skipping out on relationships ending them before giving them a chance feeling guilty for it and hesitating to do any of it all over again and having to face the same repercussions but according to all of the characters no woman is like this because they are all always ready for a relationship even a rocky one even aurit the smartest person nate knows and the one female friend nate doesn't seduce and leave crippled in despair supports this claim that all women are exactly the same in this how nice that waldman has us weepy women finally understand the plight of the secretly sensitive d bag and lets us all know that the only differences between us are in intellect and hair color it's great that she worked so hard to represent nate but is it worth the expense of reducing females or does she actually believe this she drops a lot of literature names like tolstoy and proust but it just seems like cosmo underneath all that i also dislike the cynical voice that sticks people into categories based on brands they wear or books they read on the subway it's not observant and astute it's simplistic lazy and judgmental it reminds me of what i didn't like about franzen and eugenides but without their backbones to make up for it maybe to appreciate it you have to live in snarky manhattan instead of say vermont do not sign me up","951":"ugh nate is such a shit men don't be like nate well written but man did i dislike the main character","952":"the character of nate was so precisely painted that i feel like i've known him for a while i suppose it helps that i have encountered people similar to him before but i think his character is an accurate representation of a very specific subset of highly educated privileged city dwellers nate is incredibly self aware to the point of being neurotic and it was entertaining to have what are often my own thought processes written out in a book waldman does a superb job of getting deep into the brain in particular i found this to be a painfully true account of how some modern enlightened intellectual straight males approach women and relationships on one hand they are hyper conscious of sexism and want to be patted on the back for their awareness of the patriarchy yet still in their thoughts and often in their actions they play out the same situations they feel so above it's a battle between brains and deeply ingrained cultural patterns and nate personifies this extremely well","953":"well that was unexpected despite numerous trustworthy people spruiking this book to me i was unpersuaded and then i started reading and the first chapter was cringe inducing justin why do novelists insist justin asked himself on pretending that people call each other by their name every time they address a statement to someone that was the last negative thought i had about the book and i had to throw that one out the window too because the next time someone unnecessarily used a name was towards the end that made it very clear that naming happened only when nathaniel p was extremely uncomfortable feeling guilty and trying to deflect that guilt my bad now before i slaver on too much know that this book is not for everyone the jane austen comparisons seem entirely accurate since austen wasn't for everyone until her books had been marketed into the shape of an empire waist and a cravat she was and is snarky intellectual ironic and completely unwilling to let you think entirely well of any of her characters waldman is like that and like mary mccarthy too this is a wonderful thing but if you really need a character who is always morally right and emotionally affecting this is not the place if you as i do think that books about dating are incredibly boring this might not be the book for you either it is also deeply polemical and of in tension with its moment i found it productive because i too am of deeply in tension with this moment like nate i grew up into male feminism like nate i am deeply impressed with my own intellect and waldman achieves what a million blogs cannot viz forces young men such as myself to think through our commitments to gender equality i like to think i come through not too bad maybe a 7 10 should try harder writes my teacher but the real target of the book are those men and women who are failing who don't just need to try harder they we need to completely rethink the way we approach political issues and alter our habits to put it a bit too glibly nate says all the right things would never utter a sexist statement would never have a sexist thought that he didn't immediately correct but is still morally repulsive because he's incapable of linking his political social conscience to his personal conduct nate is a male feminist he is also a prick not amount of literary world writing and conversation will change that if the book was really up to date nate would have been writing for websites about privilege issuing meae culpae at every turn apologizing for his skin color and genitalia and he would still be a prick because language is not deeds also i want to re read the thing i want to be hang out with the characters again i want to share a beer with hannah while she talk shit about nate and another one with aurit which i just realized i can do thanks to the ambivalent wonders of kindle and another one with jason and then talk shit about jason with someone else etc this is noteworthy because i don't care at all about this kind of thing in general but waldman made it work for me again see caveat about this not being true for everyone part of the excellence of lanp is that waldman treats issues like this in the text so you i have to think about why i'm not usually impressed by books about dating or more generally love am i like nathaniel writing off personal experiences like this because i'm a closet misogynist i hope not in any case the novel's reflexivity is very welcome and another mark in its favor","954":"i'm kinda torn about my thoughts on this one i felt like the wording was more complicated than necessary for the content of the book there wasn't much to the basic story a lot of the characters were disposable i found myself constantly questioning the main character with do men really think this way and i think that was my biggest hang up it took me away from the story and i found it to be pretty disheartening if it was true i think my feelings were half i didn't love the writing half it hit too close to home so that's my own problem but at the end i loved a lot of the philosophies the characters discussed about men and women and relationships oh and greer was a little to easy of a tool for the author to use i don't really believe the ending for a second but what do i know about the male psyche squat","955":"ouch right hahahaha nudge nod wink wink hahaha that hurt hahaha nudge wink nod nod nod hahaha amirite tell me about it hahahaha despaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiir despair despair you see inside this guy and know the true reasons he bailed on someone he loved which were all so deeply shallow that it's just kind of sad the truth was he wanted a trophy which is kind of sad too you relate to him in a way that grosses you out and makes you want us all to say stupid shit we think out loud to someone who knows the value of life a little bit better this book will make you never want to walk to the bathroom again or if you do to walk backwards with karate chop hands so you can monitor the judgements and then not blame your human worth a great case for fundamentalist religion for never assuming someone evolved and sensitive and amazing is actually that and it's just sad to be cynical","956":"great writing but i hated nate i kept waiting for him to use his critical eye on himself and his poor choices but he never did i know people in real life don't but i think writers do and he was a writer if men are like that these days i'd rather stay single","957":"it's a secret until book club","958":" a really interesting take on a central character who seems like he ought to be likable but just isn't nate is a young man pushing 30 a harvard educated writer who's about to have his first success he thinks he has the right politics and the right attitudes toward his friends but he treats women badly and he just doesn't get what he's doing wrong most of the novel is about his affair with a smart appealing young woman named hannah and how he does her wrong but more than that it's a look at a young man and we can probably generalize to many or most straight young men who just isn't that interested in young women except to get laid and how any other attitude strikes him as so foreign as to be bizarre the writer adelle waldman really gets inside nate's head and somehow she makes him compelling even though his attitudes and actions are fairly reprehensible reading her novel made me glad i'm no longer nate's age","959":"i kept putting off reading this thinking i didn't want to spend my time inside the mind of a smug hipster and that was exactly where this book took me but it was excellent well written funny completely believable i was disgusted by nate but couldn't stop reading i enjoyed it so much i was almost a little sad when i finished great book","960":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here in an attempt to expose myself to new authors and because the cover of this novel is both colorful and simple the love affairs of nathaniel p found its way into my hands and subsequently into my mind i was extremely excited to begin this story especially when i gleaned that the narrative voice was a male perspective though written by a woman i was curious to see how accurately a woman could write the thoughts of a man especially when it comes to relatioinships of the heart the novel in an attempt to expose myself to new authors and because the cover of this novel is both colorful and simple the love affairs of nathaniel p found its way into my hands and subsequently into my mind i was extremely excited to begin this story especially when i gleaned that the narrative voice was a male perspective though written by a woman i was curious to see how accurately a woman could write the thoughts of a man especially when it comes to relatioinships of the heart the novel details the many relationships of an ivy league educated early thirties writer who has found some small semblance of success in new york city a son of jewish immigrants nate details his relationships with 1 his parents who seem to think that he has not achieved a success worthy of his educational backround 2 his friends whose varying perspecitives and humanist attitudes often make nate feel either guilty or just and 3 his relationships with women sexually emotionally and intellectually his honesty in describing each of these different kinds of relationships exposes him completely and allows the reader an intimiate profile of the male psyche opening the character to ridicule and judgement his opinions and thoughts are not masked or apologized for but described rationalized and explained deeply by the character himself even as he recognizes that some of them are elitist and misogynist i have to admit that i detested the character of nate for most of the novel his attitudes tended to be elitist and narcissistic despite his own dislike of his mother for her conscending attitudes toward american tastes as the primary relationship outlined in the novel that of nate and hannah escalates and then fails i found myself angry and appalled by the character judging him for his lack of affection his inability to communicate and his complete misleading of the woman in his life however upon reflection i realized that my emotions were activated primarily because i saw myself in hannah initially described as confident witty and intelligent as her relationship with nate fails she becomes insecure annoying and argumentative i watched her progress into this state and recognized the process given that i have undergone the same transformation i was angry with nate for the same reasons i was angry with previous men in my own life for condemning a woman for her reaction and subsequent effort to repair what has started to break and forgiving him his faults even though he is a character is as difficult as forgiving those men who have hurt myself and my friends in reality the reason that this novel merits such a high rating is the truth of its expression and the accuracy with which the author portrays the experience of unsuccessful male female relationships it offers an honest account of one man's experience in a promising relationship one that will enrage and flabbergast and annoy women everywhere indeed i am sure many women who read this book will be disgusted by nate however i ask those women to consider their own failed relationships and explore if the man they knew was not in some part like nate that is the gem that this novel provides if women allow themselves to put aside their disgust of nate they might actually learn a few things from him i am not generalizing i am not arguing that all men are like him however i think he does offer a few insights that women may find both aggravating and helpful my favorite quote men and women on relationships are like men and women on orgasms except in reverse jason continued boisterously women crave relationships the way men crave orgasm their whole being bends to its imperative men in contrast want relationships the way women want orgasm sometimes under the right circumstances although i'm sure most women wouldn't mind an orgasm every time more","961":"many times offers the feeling of i know someone just like this or uh oh i identify with that this book has captured something about relationships like it or not i liked its honesty even when i didn't like its characters","962":" the author seems to be able to handle a male protagonist and paints nathaniel as a self absorbed sexual author publisher type in his 20s with few redeeming virtues the saving grace in the lack of substantial story is that the author is a great writer and does extremely well in developing the extensive world of brooklyn publishing so much so that the reader keeps going just to hear the latest details of what is going on in it i left the so called front story in chapter one and was propelled along simply because of the back story hopefully waldman's second novel will revolve around likable people","963":"the uphills were engaging the downhills left me just as uninterested as the main character","964":"loved the way it was written and how it gets into a guys head but as a single woman a little disappointed in the ending","965":"this is a book that captures a moment in time perfectly maybe a little too perfectly the characters are annoyingly realistic in a way and the way they interact is frustrating for it well written very interesting if you're interested in moment in time explorations of a sub culture in nyc","966":"this one hit a little too close to home","967":"startling to find a woman entering the head of nathaniel so thoroughly and with such shockingly awful insight","968":" somewhat sentimentally i decided this would be a fun book to read following my migration to brooklyn earlier this autumn of course i'd heard of it as a trendy 2013 read but more interesting to me was the way so many critics with surprise decided that waldman a ~~ woman ~~ writer had elegantly evoked compassion for a male protagonist that himself seems not wholly compassionate towards the women he talks to flirts with is the friend of fucks dates and so on personally i find the notion that artists shouldn't or can't effectively imagine the interiors of people different from themselves on the bases of gender race sexuality etc to be an incredibly outmoded analytic formula and one that tends to perpetuate deterministic ideals of identity rather than to dismantle them by the same token i was surprised by how subtly waldman had written nate p's psychic world and how nuanced was his emotional relation to women in a few moments i felt that his thinking about the various women in his life sounded a bit too on the nose as though a commenter from jezebel com sorry y'all the comments on that site are so reductive that the site seems to be finally working more against than with feminist causes had ventriloquized a generic male 'antagonist' but for the most part waldman does a phenomenal job of imagining the ways in which we are shockingly capable of holding a multitude of responses and feelings towards others at once often many which seem incongruous with one another contradictory and particularly the ways in which affection and cruelty are twinned in our handling of those we are most attached to that said the novel ultimately seemed to me a bit flimsy it captured a certain moment and a certain place its idea of gentrifying brooklyn particularly those who are generating the gentrification in their late 20s and early 30s seems fairly spot on though of course i've only been here a few months now nate is a wonderfully intricate character too but then it feels by the end to be primarily a 200 page character study something that may have been more effective as a 30 50 page short story or novella are we calling these novelettes now with a heartier emotional punch as it was it felt thinner and thinner as the novel chugged along an enjoyable read though and one that does manage to capture something about the transient status of the heart which is here and there very moving","969":"if this wasn't for book club i would not have finished it it did lead to interesting discussion but be forewarned it is a comedy of manners which is literary jargon for nothing actually happens","970":"the love affiars of nathaniel p by adelle waldman is a book about nate a youngish writer who has paid his dues with book reviews and freelance work and has a new novel about to hit the stands he is a bit of a playa in his set of over educated navel gazers and when we meet him he is single this quickly changes when he meets hannah at an ex girlfriend's dinner party hannah is everything that nate typically doesn't date she is low key smart interesting and straight forward at first nate is really excited about the relationship but as time goes on he keeps trying to find things that are wrong he thinks about what he hasn't liked about other girlfriends like that they nagged him then he tests hannah to see if he can make her nag him hannah is in a no win situation where if she doesn't nag him nate will keep behaving badly until she finally does at which point he can pounce on her for being a nag just like all the rest as the title suggests blatantly the book is all about nate's relationship drama it is interesting that nathaniel p is written in a jane austen style but from the man's perspective and that it is written by a woman i found myself wondering if men or some men anyway actually do think like nate or if the story is really telling how women believe men like nate think to read more of this review please click here http sonotarunner blogspot com 2014","971":"to be rated after book club meeting","972":"while it was interesting to read a love story from a male perspective i found it hard to finish the book without taking a breather in between i found nate tiring and somewhat lacking i thought the character development of the females was worthwhile although they still succumbed to nate","973":"scary insight into the male mind read my full review plus get a menu for a book club meeting and a play list of music at http daeandwrite wordpress com 2014","974":"i really am not sure what i think about this book at first i thought no man the main character is a man author is a woman would ever think so much about dating relationships it felt unrealistic but about 3 4 through the book i began to really hate him for an author to evoke that is pretty successful the book really made me pay attention to my feelings about nate hated the ending though","975":"loved it reminds me of the way wally lamb wrote women's first person narratives so well great job getting into the brain of a guy","976":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it's all the rage yesterday i read an admiring profile in the ny times of adelle waldman they met at a

scene turns out while she was writing a quasi fictional book about literary brooklyn her husband was a book called literary brooklyn the writers of brooklyn and the story of american city life but all of that is scenery all of that is gossip i read this book because it was supposed to introduce the jane austen of the 21st century with that perspective you can see waldman made some excellent choices for moral satire she chose a bounded community with shared expectations ambitions and vanities a sliver of brooklyn itself a swollen sliver of nyc she chose for the novel's perspective a young man recently come into his strengths his intelligence his attractiveness his ability to mime love she threw this walking foible into rough spots a good start nate hated really hated being told he thought too much but not thinking was a way of giving oneself license to be a dick good the high seriousness of the moral imperative the assumption of bad faith in yourself the sense that if given the chance you would be a monster despite a total lack of evidence for this sense so why didn't i love it i didn't find her dialogue writing especially convincing in particular the cutesy exchange between nathaniel and aurit about the arugula and prosciutto pizza seemed snipped from a romantic comedy it didn't read like a man's friendship with a woman also waldman's habit of inserting jumpy ironic phrases in italics meant to represent nathaniel's thoughts on the fly it did not feel like a man's thinking i'm not an expert but i'm one after all and i've known a couple rather i thought waldman was leaning against an easy genre style snappy romantic comedies rather than people on the fly aurit the author's mouthpiece see her speech about dating being the most fraught human interaction there is it's dumb to have to say there's important things to say about love but there are but waldman is interested in dating as a kind of consumerism where alarmingly your purchase talks back to you and can conceivably anchor you to children relationships even the positive relationship offered by hannah are in this book investments part of five year plans where is the odi et amo sed fieri sentio et excrucior an irritant that might at any moment set her off like science was for the medieval church that i found myself wondering if greer on page 233 was a sideways look at lena dunham that hannah is almost inexpressibly perfect not merely a good woman that nathaniel fails but the bunyanesque image of unappreciated woman that nathaniel walks through almost exactly the same paces as rob in high fidelity including mildly admitting to real cruelty in other words just dark enough to be more than a pasty fuck up just articulate enough to be more than a bad guy jerk overall it's good sharp attuned to the batsqueaks of conversation and flirting occasionally atmospheric but quickened with action waldman also shows the guilty self obsession and the narcissism of self recrimination which leads not to enlightened citizens but boils of resentment and childishness worth a read more","977":"an interesting read not a particularly sympathetic main character i'm curious as to how realistic nate is given that he was penned by a woman","978":"so how many reviewers liked this book because it nailed their own douchiness so well nate is an a hole and after a while the description of his first world problems got tedious that being said he had a pretty distinctive voice and given that the author is a female i guess she nailed it well enough for everyone to think she did a great job","979":"because it is written by a female from the male perspective i would really love to hear what the male reader thinks of it","980":"mixed between a 2 and a 3 a 2 because it annoyed me or a 3 because i'm sure it was supposed to annoy me too much of a self obsessed misogynist","981":"it was okay an easy read interesting characters must i can't say i loved it","982":"big disappointment the book got glowing reviews but deserved none of them though waldman has a nice fluid writing style her characters are shallow vapid and generally uninteresting privileged young new yorkers who spend their time wallowing in angst over their careers in publishing and or their love lives while doing very little to seemingly merit any of their accomplishments","983":"this is a fairly light read but one i enjoyed very much reminded me a bit of a classic woody allen film both in terms of topic and of tone extremely well observed with the protagonist being as likable as he is infuriating perfect holiday reading in the best sense of the word","984":" the most painfully honest account of an intellectual's over thinking approach to relationships i've ever read a lot of people might hate the main character nate for being a misogynist or even just an asshole but it's the depth of insight into the mental gymnastics and self justifications behind every action which seem like meanness or shallowness on the surface that's so fascinating because in the end he's not an asshole he's a flawed human being stuck in a negative feedback loop of endlessly examining his own thoughts and feelings something that can happen to any thoughtful person trying their best to find love","985":"hmmmm a lot of thoughts mainly adelle waldman did an amazing job of pretty much summarizing each view point of a relationship boy girl friend who is a boy friend who is a girl ex girlfriend etc etc i think the emotions and the tide and current of the relationship between hannah and nate was excellently depicted and well felt in today's modern dating world it's hard not to relate to some part of this story","986":"good writing keeps you reading because most of the characters are people you wouldn't give a second thought they take self absorption to new heights","987":"the love affairs of nathaniel p is a brilliantly observed novel that smacks of intelligence you know when you drive past a landfill and have to stop breathing for a bit because the smell saturates the air smells are to landfills what intelligence is to waldman her intelligence is the very best kind abundant yet deft potent yet sneaky unpretentious not interested in preening and aimed at precision in a way that delivers the tag line on the paperback for every woman who's ever wondered why he didn't call and every man who has felt guilty--but not guilty enough--about not calling makes me want to perform violence it doesn't do this novel justice and i very nearly didn't read it when i saw it that bit of marketing doesn't get at its true appeal yes this is a novel about contemporary dating and yes it captures skewers really the male ego yes it's funny and trenchant and you'll feel some echo of past relationships miscommunication spats the maddening dynamics of dating it's somewhat reminiscent of nick hornby except that it transcends hornby this is a much smarter more precise more wicked and more literary hornby this is what hornby can only dream of being what adelle waldman does best is capture characters with surgical precision if you've ever read a novel where the characters particularly the minor ones blur together here is the antidote each figure jason aurit hannah greer is vividly drawn i could take a quiz on these characters i know what one would say vs what one would never say how they would argue what they might wear they don't sit around in the wings until waiting for their scene--they have whole separate lives waldman's understanding of human motivation reminded me of tolstoy here are characters at their best and worst justifying their own behavior chewing over their choices and not always choosing correctly in that this isn't just a novel about dating it's about human folly and the strange dark contours of the heart","988":" i heard this was a painfully accurate portrayal of modern dating from the perspective of a nice guy that is exactly what this book delivered the recurring question of this relationship should be working but why isn't it cuts very close to the truth some of these intellectual characters reminded me of actual friends that i have in real life i would definitely recommend this book to friends who are looking for a truthful view on dating that tries to stay away from being either optimistic or pessimistic although spoiler alert i think it will seem dark to most people","989":"the love affairs of nathaniel p reads like a jane austen novel if any of austen's works were told from the perspective of the raffish a hole who comes in one third of the way through the plot to screw everything up it's compulsively readable but i missed the winning heroine and i wanted to kick nate p off a building this book should come with a warning do not read if you want to feel good about men","990":"there are a lot of characters to keep track of none of whom is particularly likeable but i enjoyed adelle waldman's writing","991":" adelle waldman really nails those ambivalent moments that crop up during the one year settling in phase of a relationship a bit of a downer in terms of highlighting human shortcomings and the disappointment intimacy can sometimes bring but not because she doesn't write about such topics magnificently well her writing is incisive and keeps these brooklyn types from being flat cliches instead their struggles against type and nate's failure to mediate a middle ground between intention and habit personality keep them interesting fans of girls might like this it's a bit like girls for literati brooklynites in their mid career 30's less humor perhaps but more emotional nuance sharply observed","992":"do you like misandrist essays do you want to read an entire book about a gross boy who thinks he's a more evolved being than the actual intelligent and kind women he \"flirts\" with this is the book for you like surely you would think this is a satire but i am confident that many literary boys are exactly like this but not all literary boys it feels great to know that they genuinely don't get all the sick burns ladies throw at them because they're stupid this book is like reading a novel length post from the toast it's glorious","993":"very well written although it made me cringe so much at times that i could only read it in short bursts every straight woman i know who was or is single in nyc has met a nathaniel p shudder","994":"i loved the way this book really and truly got inside nate's mind and didn't mince words when it came to exactly what he was thinking i don't know if i've ever read a book that gave such an honest account of a characters true feelings and intentions i honestly i couldn't even figure out whether or not nate was an ass because the author portrayed him as someone who would just have a thought and then contemplate what it meant it made me almost not blame him for the rude pretentious thoughts he had because they seemed so natural almost beyond his control his feelings and opinions were so raw and i found the main relationship of the book to be fascinating i got lost in skimming at times especially in the last few chapters so that's the reason for the 4 star rating but anyone into books about relationships especially messy and imperfect ones will like this","995":"this book is a lot more sad and a lot less funny than i expected but i'm glad i read it it's full of rather uncomfortable insight the author gets inside the head of a twenty thirty something intellectual guy with well i can't say if it's accuracy but it explains their behavior and thought processes more lucidly than i've ever been able to figure out from the outside and a lot more sympathy than maybe they deserve also it was a rather fascinating experience to read this right after iris has free time the same coin flipped","996":"this is definitely my new favorite novel adelle waldman is brilliant i couldn't stop laughing throughout the book even though the story is quite sad the story brings the reader into literary new york and dating dynamics there i can't wait to read more from her","997":"really it should be a 3 5 i enjoy debut novels and being as it so frickin' hot now in phx i enjoyed the review which pegged it a beach read i lounged by the pool and got through it quickly the characters are immediately recognizable some largely stereotypes still the whole dating scene whether you are familiar with new york and that whole bizarre scene or not whether you identify with the new writers that congregate in brooklyn the new hip place or the snobbishness of east coast name colleges all of that off putting to most of the country did the author not know this or was it intentional i still say i enjoyed the read in the context of beach read in keeping with the theme of beach read are the struggles that men women have in early dating steadies moving in together commitment ha nothing much changes regardless of age so i laughed groaned anticipated correctly as to nate and his growth maturity or not such an asshole that every woman in america has known in some way or another nate comes from middleclass immigrant parents very snobbish about their smarts and not only is one smart dude but goes to harvard thus furthering the intellectual elitist attitude which only dampens his ability to have a relationship which he protests to all through the story me think he protests too much he criticizes every woman physically first then how serious she is how independent or needy and the list goes on the author does an okay and even fun ride as nate goes through women faster than the express lane at the grocery and always regretful about the ending thus entertaining nothing more","998":"like a couple of other novels i've recently read this one doesn't so much end as just stop happening despite a thoroughly unlikable protagonist the power of the writing carries the story along at a very nice clip until mostly just a puff of smoke could have been great","999":" i'd give this book a 4 5 i loved it i read about it in an editorial recently published in the austin statesman about why you may be a republican if you have daughters this book was used to support the trendiest poll that had come out claiming that statement obviously i was interested as a first book and a female writer writing from a male perspective i just couldn't put it down it helps that i love books set in new york and i'm a literary wanna be but the characters were so dead on i look forward to many more from this author","1000":"check out my review here http booksandbarrels blogspot com 2","1001":"the main character nate is an intellectual snob a truly unlikable character the story of his relationships are told through his eyes it's hard to make an unlikable protagonist carry a book waldman does this well but not well enough to make this an enjoyable read the best moments of the book are when scenes are relived via a fight with his girlfriend and she shows that the way he perceived things was wrong","1002":"made me glad i wasn't dating guys can be such douches","1003":" ah so this is why my relationships in my early mid 20s were so screwed up unfortunately were you to recommend this novel to a young man in his early mid 20s he wouldn't get it or if he did intellectually i doubt it would change his behavior i can't really review the love affairs of np without spoilers but this is about as probing an analysis as there can be of a young man's solipsism the novel is in 3rd person but the narrator knows everything the protagonist nate is thinking meanwhile his love interest hannah is only revealed through quoted dialogue so as readers we get to understand what hannah is expressing while nate just doesn't get it the last 50 pp chapter 15 to the end is about as good as anything i've read in the last few years a couple of things 1 a couple of reviewers have invoked jane austen as the model for this novel but that is wrong it's george eliot and henry james all the way indeed i would say that as a relatively short novel it has more in common with james's early more satirical fictions the epigraph is from eliot romola and there is a rather key reference to madame merle p 130 that in context suggests how much growing up nate really needs to do 2 insofar as the novel is thinking through some henry james thematics is this even possible in a novel with sex scenes i have to say the power of james comes from what he can't narrate according to his own predilections and the norms of the time i really think adelle waldman is going to emit a 5 star novel if when she attempts to tell a story involving older adults","1004":"this book is so well known that i don't think i have much to add anyway i sped my way through it not because it was bad--i actually found it amusing nate is really quite the douchebag but the amusing part is that he suspects he is too but then he sits down to eat his raisin bran and plan the next great american novel","1005":" the questions that come to mind when reading the love affairs of nathaniel p are is every man like this is he an asshole or the combination of his circumstances and his high self regard who was right in his relationship with hannah and who was wrong and most importantly am i like this how much can we forgive ourselves for certainly our worst impulses tend toward the nathaniel and our best impulses tend toward imagining that everyone else doesn't feel this way about other people that it is us we are wrong and sociopathic and shouldn't evaluate our previous partners on their style of dress or the way they kissed or their cringing attitude whenever we met their parents i came across marina keegan's short story \"cold pastoral\" today and it reminded me of nathaniel p in the story claire is in college and her not quite boyfriend brian dies in a car accident at the behest of his previous girlfriend she recovers his diary and then unadvisedly reads it its excerpts sounded much like nathaniel he wonders whether he is still in love with his previous girlfriend whether he really likes claire how things went wrong before and how they might be made right who was hotter and who was better in bed and whether the grass is always greener in the past claire gets over her discoveries and marina keegan was herself killed in a car accident shortly after writing the story making me want to write solely about centenarians who are still in love with their grad school sweethearts after all these years... but we can say the same of hannah hannah moves on hannah herself is not blameless in her breakup with nathaniel she sends him a terrible maudlin email and then another scathing email after he doesn't respond to the first but hannah forgives herself and we can quickly forgive her too she is upset and tends toward over expressing her emotions nathaniel tends toward discounting his emotions undermining them and second guessing them his admiration for his quirky israeli best friend is at times the best thing about him he thinks and then a second later shallow she expresses her opinions about iced coffee as vehemently and eloquently as her opinions about love and relationships or misguided he watches her interactions with a waiter and her habit of brining the conversation back to the same points over and over again and begins to hate her it is this duplicity that we hate in ourselves and find hard to forgive in nate's character we don't want our friends to think these things behind our backs even though undoubtedly they do we don't want our partners to think that we look worse than a passing stranger we don't even want our partners to notice the passing stranger even if we are being less than perfectly engaging admitting what we actually think about other people especially those closest to us is unthinkable it seems clear that nate doesn't want a relationship with any of the women he meets but also doesn't have the willpower to say no his friendship with aurit is rare and the fact of it is still surprising to him most of the women he meets who want to date him aren't trying to be his friend first and the only way he can get to know them better is to date them maturation through this process is a series of trials by fire nate hardly knows how to argue with his friends how to express his disapproval of their behavior or even how to tell them he disagrees a friend of his asks him to save a seat at a lecture for example from the beginning nate thinks this is silly and knows he won't do it but goes along and even pretends to apologize to the friend when he doesn't save the seat he is learning how to disagree with someone he cares for through the process of upsetting and losing everyone he is supposed to care for the most his parents have their own particular and peculiar ways of interacting with him which haven't prepared him well for communicating with a girlfriend his father is mostly oblivious to the realities of nate's life and nate's nuanced ambivalences about his choices while his mother implicitly demands to be treated as the most important person in his life while not allowing him to criticize her or even change the subject as a result of never being allowed to be honest with his parents nate abstracts them he loves the idea of their struggles and production of him as a successful person and he is ashamed of their shortcomings and obliviousness by never airing his frustrations with them and never seeing them change nate comes to think of his girlfriends in the same way people he has to put up with entirely as they are people he can evaluate in secret but never be comfortable around people who will never truly know him but who he cannot influence in any substantive way he can't bring up the way hannah's drinking unsettles him or the way her style of communication feels oppressive to him he notes it and it adds to the gap between them a gap that hannah feels but one that is never explained to her nate struggles with his own feelings and thoughts ultimately absolving him of his guilt about them but he never confesses them and of course we forgive ourselves for much less than others will--self absorption magnifies every sin--but nate is still far from sharing his thoughts as was brian and though they keep these thoughts to themselves to avoid causing discomfort claire and hannah and those who come after will still be hurt by everything that was left unsaid","1006":"i've wanted to read the love affairs of nathaniel p since i first heard about it on other people with brad listi my first literary podcast love i remember loving the idea of the book as well as relating to adelle's descriptions of her writing process it was a great episode go check it out having finally gotten my hands on it i must say it lived up the hype adelle waldman delivers a wonderful character exploration in the form of nathaniel nate piven rising literary star brooklynite freelance book reviewer and asshole read the rest of my review here http www thewhynottblog com book re","1007":"i liked it that's all i can say about this book the protagonist was certainly hateful in most places intensely dislikable in the rest but the author's phrasing and the voice she created for nate made the book far better than it would be have been if someone else had written","1008":" this book was so fucking relatable it hurt it's about the particular brand of hell that's modern urban dating told through the eyes of the insufferably self impressed nate waldman absolutely nails the subtleties of this particular type of shitty guy in an intelligent nuanced way nate's the creative professionally connected ivy league educated 30 something brooklynite who thinks they own the fucking city and are entitled to the very best women the incredibly ridiculous balance of hot but chic fun light but intellectual smart but not as smart as them without ever wanting to be burdened with the banalities of an emotional relationship the story is told from the perspective of nathaniel p nate the confused about women pretentious literary up and comer the narrating voice reminded me a bit of babbit by sinclair lewis in that the main character is this fumbling asshole whose appalling inner monologues are kind of like watching a car crash nate doesn't think he's an asshole - yet he continues to dismiss overanalyze condescend to and generally cast aside the women in his life all while performing the mental acrobatics of believing he's the one who's been wronged the tensions of the relationships and the anxieties of both nate and his girlfriends were spot on absolutely spot on the point is that you're supposed to hate him at moments you get swept up in his own rationalizations for the way he treats the women in his life until you realize his ridiculous standards and anxieties leave him incapable of truly caring about women as whole flawed people he is the worst to be honest i feel like i'm dating this guy now and i kinda feel like his cast aside girlfriend sometimes the one who should know better but still is really worked up over whether or not he seemed bored over drinks the other night and the on top of that the whole thing is set in brooklyn on the blocks that i'm always hanging out on way too real","1009":"it is depressing i am depressed it's the initial secret joy of seeing someone else's answers at the next desk then the sinking realization that you're not even taking the same test","1010":" horrible impulse buy as i was looking for something light but i should have guessed it would be bad too many gushing reviewer quotes all over it two on the front eight on the back and eleven pages inside too much of a hard sell perhaps having read it i can only guess that critics were reluctant to turn on one of their own i did not expect to like the male protagonist one of the cover quotes warned he would inspire flights of lesbianism but i didn't expect him to be so utterly uninteresting nor the female characters so equally boring i was in no danger of finding them to be a better bet than nate the characters were as stereotypical and one dimensional as the brooklyn setting self obsessed shallow vessels for the tired generalisations the author wanted to make about male female relationships they were more like stick drawings than caricatures with no real plot to sustain or develop them if this book is as another cover quote suggests scarily accurate i need to become a hermit and read better books","1011":"i'm pretty sick of books without any plot that just serve as platforms for the authors to espouse their grating opinions and wax philosophical about uninteresting topics nate and the author aren't as smart as they think they are barf on this book","1012":"first i don't know if i would call this the love affairs of nathaniel p the book mostly centers around the main character nate and his relationship with the smart interesting and modern hannah the narrator goes into nate's brain often mostly while he's messing around in his apartment attempting to read write reviews eat and tells the reader of his romantic past nate was not always popular with women but he is smart and has learned how to look at women with a critical and fascinated eye nate's relationship with hannah feels so contemporary and real they are intellectual equals and yet things end up devolving for confusing and murky reasons i actually appreciated waldman's ending speaking to the impreciseness of relationships and love she gave nate a love interest who is not expected i would recommend this to anyone interested in the brooklyn literary scene and the hipster culture within intellectuals in new york","1013":"for the first quarter i thought i was going to quite enjoy this book but then it became apparent that absolutely nothing was going to happen he dates hannah treats her badly and then starts dating greer which serves him right in between he eats out a lot meets up with his friends comments on the appearance of every woman who crosses his path and is generally completely self absorbed i gather a lot of the attention this book received was due to the fact that it was written by a woman but really who cares who wrote it it was not very interesting","1014":"meh spending several days inside the head of an essentially unlikeable guy didn't do it for me","1015":"waldman has said in interviews that reading writers like george eliot have influenced her and it's easy to see how in this skillful debut a lot of the hype i'd heard centered around nate's bad behavior so i wasn't sure if i'd like the book but waldman crafts such a detailed compelling portrait that i found myself caring about nate even though his behavior is reprehensible actually i didn't find him as awful as other reviewers readers but i think that's to waldman's credit the obnoxious unlikeable character debate misses the point waldman shows how for this reader anyhow it's not about a character's likeability but rather about how interesting and compelling an author can craft a story with all sorts of people it looks like from other goodreads reviews that some readers found the book so so and some didn't like it but i found this glimpse into the brooklyn literary scene fascinating i loved listening in on the intellectual and pseudo intellectual conversations and posturing i hesitate to recommend books these days since so much can affect a person's experience with a book so i'd say anyone who likes a good social commentary or psychological portrait and doesn't mind being inside a male brain for 240 pages might give this a try","1016":" there's an argument to be made that this book is intentionally written so that you're disgusted with the lead character and his actions but i'm not here to make it nathaniel is the worst he thinks he's better than everyone and everything while telling himself he doesn't think that he sits around pondering himself and his love life more than carrie bradshaw but slams carrie bradshaw while doing so i would have been better off reading something by tucker max at least he owns that he's a dbag","1017":"as much as i despised the main character i couldn't stop reading the book because sadly i have dated the main character and so have all of my friends an interesting study into a self described nice guy who is really anything but easy to get through but hard to take","1018":"maybe not for everyone but i loved it","1019":"wow the first 100 pages after that disappointing how long can i read about one man's relationship when said relationship is little more than a series of conversations about said man's friends and how much he doesn't know if he likes them seems like the review i write for every it book of 20 starts strong but the premise is better saved for a short story","1020":"my immediate thoughts after reading this book u0026amp living inside the head of this irritating despicable u0026amp slightly all too true literary brooklyn hipster kill me now or just let me find a great job on a mountaintop somewhere remote","1021":" the author tried so hard to be intellectual too hard that her main character nate was more judged than empathized with instead of being seen as scholarly nate inevitably came off as an elitist who only thinks he is well educated because of his ivy league education the dialogue between his friends and girlfriends tried to prove a point but lost the reader in the process it was too mechanical too forced and too obviously trying to make the reader feel smarter by seemingly convoluted yet simple and superficial arguments the character of aurit could have had more depth otherwise she's pretty much unnecessary to the story she could have been omitted and the book would have maintained the same weight throughout the book i wasn't convinced that this was the mind of a man we were getting insight to i was keenly aware that a woman was the author","1022":" well drawn portrait of a douchebag nate p does inspire some sympathy he wants to be a good person he wants to do the right thing he just keeps managing to take whatever course of action will make the next hour of his life easier no matter the long term consequences this passivity and the attitude that he's done what was expected of him so how could anyone complain will probably dredge up painful memories for women who have put up with this nonsense in the past not that the women are blameless the more astute ones rightly so seem just as mad at themselves for getting so ensnared as at nate for being his sometimes weaselly self the less astute ones seem to practice some pretty impressive self deception was it an accurate picture of a smart but fickleman's emotional landscape it seems plausible but i'm not in a position to verify overall this was a fun book to read and it skewers and offers some sympathy to both sexes but i wonder how nate's demographic would view it","1023":"this book actually kind of upset me which was not at all the reaction i was expecting from what i thought would be a cheerful love story nate is self absorbed and treats women and their emotions like toys at his disposal it upset me so much i had an emotional break down on my best guy friend begging him to tell me men aren't really this awful","1024":"at least the writing is good affected pretentious immature characters uugghh calls to mind the hbo series girls an unwatchable group of characters who refuse to grow or mature","1025":" i think this book would mean a lot more to you if the hipster brooklyn literati are an actual part of your life a lot of reviewers seem to have taken it as a kind of thesis on the way all modern young men think about women when it seems more likely that it's an approximation of the way quite specific types of young men in certain parts of america think about women it felt both overwrought and lightweight the nice bits aren't that nice and the nasty bits aren't that nasty it's doesn't feel exactly excoriating of the casual misogyny of nathaniel p types and for a book whose entire raison d'etre is the realness of it's characters they don't actually feel especially vibrant or distinct i certainly didn't come away with a vivid sense of who hannah was or elisa or peter or mark or greer the central relationship is very cleverly calibrated indeed the entire book is very clever and cleverly written and it's pleasant enough to read but it's designation as a 'book of our times' seems to be somewhat overstating it","1026":"one star for writing very funny and observant but zero or minus stars for characters esp the title character who seems to embrace the worst qualities that a man who is not a criminal can ever possess who are simply beyond unlikeable a total waste of time okay i got a few chuckles","1027":"most of the time while reading i just felt the need to close the book and just smack nate in the head with it wish that was possible all in all i felt i was in a male version of girls a bit pretentious but in the end so true","1028":"well that sure was the least romantic book about love that i've ever read this pretty much was a woody allen movie in book form i suppose the author intended to make her protagonist loathsome and the women characters who were supposed to be mold breaking not so mold breaking there were some scenes and interactions that i could genuinely identify with and the writing is decent but intellectualizing about things like racialism class and gentrification made it seem like everyone related to writing and publishing are entitled self absorbed pricks who live in a bubble","1029":"i feel ambivalent about this book there were many times when i thought this book tells me more about the narcissism of 30 somethings than i really need to know but waldman also does a marvelous job of creating a very convincing protagonist a hyper critical hyper intellectual writer who refuses to fall in love although he desperately wants to","1030":"really into it cutting insightful well done","1031":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here nate is insecure self absorbed a prick a judger etc what else is new i wonder how the author a woman managed to get inside the head of this young man i think she took all the worst attributes of all the sleazy guys she ever dated and rolled them into nate the pseudo intellectualism simultaneously grated and amused nate is clueless but manages to get in the end what he deserves","1032":"this is the kind of book that after you've sat down and read it for a while you start thinking in the same writing style i like it a lot it's intelligent and verbose but still manages to be snappy and clear waldman describes feelings especially romantic ones that i've never been able to put into words and in a way that is not corny or cringe worthy this book is smart and relevant and talks about relationships in a way that is poignant and serious a romance novel that doesn't trivialize romance or overdo it a quick read that makes me wish i wrote it","1033":"i struggled with this book i found it both honest and incredibly irritating this is the universal and profound way in which many of the people i know hope to understand question their existences i can't tell if my frustration with this book came more from its accuracy or its pretension probably a combination of both","1034":"adelle waldman does a wonderful job of summarizing the inner thoughts of a her main character regarding many aspects his parents his friends his girlfriends his education etc mostly i sincerely and truly hope that men do not think this way about women","1035":"i don't imagine anyone will be inviting adelle waldman and keith gessen to the same dinner party any time soon as has been noted this book is basically a study and a takedown of the young brooklyn literary scene the central character is keith er nate the harvard educated son of immigrant parents who is having a moment on the eve of the publication of his first novel nate like almost every character in this book is that certain type of intellectual elitist who measures the worth of everyone around him by how much they know and so when nate is not agonizing over his romantic entanglements more on this later he is pondering and evaluating and deconstructing this or that obscure literary trope or deep intellectual conundrum it all gets a little tiresome frankly but at least i now know who svevo is and feel appropriately shamed that last week i did not so the story itself is basically high brow chick lit nate as drawn by waldman is not a bad guy except when it comes to women where he's mostly kind of a dick he stumbles through a series of relationships and one night stands struggles to do the right thing acts like a jerk but not always and spends an inordinate amount of time analyzing it all and right there is where this book lost me a lot has been made of the fact that this story is told from the perspective of a man but written by a woman sorry but you can tell not to say that men don't think about women in some of the ways that nate does i know they do but waldman's self esteem issues are ever present in the ways that she describes nate's perceptions of women and this was both distracting and sad nate's thoughts about women can be boiled down to the following this one is so pretty and thin my girlfriend looks fat in those jeans so i'm not attracted to her right now this girl i've been dating isn't as pretty as i thought so now i'm done and it's not just that you know how when you're dating a guy you spend a lot of time analyzing the meaning of things with your girlfriends most of the time i felt like the character of nate was born out of that sort of analysis and lacking a sort of deeper understanding of the true nature of men i never was able to fully engage with nate because i kept picturing adelle waldman telling someone about her boyfriend all that being said this was a quick and fairly entertaining read good for the subway","1036":"it seems possible to me that you could argue for hours about many aspects of this book but the truth is this book is pretty great well written fiction is always welcome in my world","1037":"so brooklyn it hurts this made me incredibly grateful that i am a boring married lady and not currently part of this dating scene because yeesh","1038":"it is not so much of a review but rather an essay inspired by this book http www kunalsen com 1 post 2014 0","1039":"it makes me wonder if that's how men think because that's certainly how i think they do i liked it in that stop telling the story of my life so well kind of way damn","1040":"like girls and parts of gone girl nathaniel p is a terrifying book for its brutal honesty and its direct reflection on the tiny cruelties of relationships gender imbalances and how we doom ourselves in love the biggest takeaway is that nathaniel p like richard in i am having so much fun here without you and so many franzen characters and franzen himself fundamentally doesn't respect women despite his liberal education super scary read for this single lady","1041":"it was very interesting to read a male character written by a female the book touched on a lot of things i believe women are usually thinking in relationships and made me feel justified and comforted to know that these are useful and valid concerns this is definitely a relate able story for anyone dating in their late 20s early 30s it was very honest but at times frustrating","1042":"an ugly book about an ugly person who is only thinly understood by the author possibly a dating hardship revenge novel","1043":"i think i would have approach the structure of the story a bit differently but i do like how the author linked the main character's aka nate current love affairs with his past love affairs i am a bit confused about why so much of the story was devoted to one relationship that failed if it had helped nathaniel grow as a person i might have understood but it didn't in my estimation it is a well written book and easy to read i look forward to reading future stories by ms waldman","1044":"i really wanted to like nick i really did but he was such a jerk to read the full review go to https www simplybethanysite wordpre","1045":"gave good insight into the mindset of the man but found the characters singularly unlikeable","1046":"provides veritably useful insight into the psyche of a man child but lacks a central plot beyond dating which let's face it is utterly boring unique in its genre as a narrative about millennial dating and the albeit well meaning assholes who run amuck in it none of the characters are likeable and this was so anti climactic that i found enjoyment in reading tv guide","1047":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wow it is almost as if adelle waldman crawled into the brain of every urban american male i've dated and used the data to create nate the love affairs of nathaniel p isnt chick lit it's more d klit written by a chick an amazing feat for sure hilarious like literally laughing out loud in public places funny smart and sad sometimes painful to read maybe bc a lot of it is too familiar in the end he chooses the flighty one over the one who intellectually challenged him what wow it is almost as if adelle waldman crawled into the brain of every urban american male i've dated and used the data to create nate the love affairs of nathaniel p isnt chick lit it's more d klit written by a chick an amazing feat for sure hilarious like literally laughing out loud in public places funny smart and sad sometimes painful to read maybe bc a lot of it is too familiar in the end he chooses the flighty one over the one who intellectually challenged him what else is new and i as the heterosexual single urban american female didn't feel bad or sad or really have any affection for nate the central character and i never got the impression that i was supposed to while i loved the book my parting thoughts on nate were good riddance and doubt that he'll ever grow up more","1048":"this book was painful to get through nathaniel was annoying and i mostly just wanted to smack him the only exciting thing about reading this book is that it brought me to my reading goal i am no longer 3 books behind schedule it seems like i have written that same sentence recently in another review hmm","1049":" a tale of a brooklyn hipster living and loving in our modern world for me nate was detestable he is a serial monogamist dating one girl after another in his small circle of wannabe journalists writers he moves on and virtually has no guilt about leaving his past lovers behind when one relationship doesn't work out he simply moves on to the next in only a few short years nate will be showing slides or videos for our present day media of all of his ballbusters on parade just like jack nicholson did as the cad in carnal knowledge although that was the '70's this is the '10's and it's basically the same thing i enjoyed waldman's writing quite a bit and look forward to reading more from her with hopefully a greater number of likeable characters","1050":" adelle waldman has received rave reviews about her book 'the love affairs of nathaniel p ' which is precisely why i added it to my growing list of books to read i was eager to read a book presumably about love from a man's perspective almost immediately i was completely repelled by the main character nate he is self absorbed misogynistic cynical un self aware and a down right prick i started to tell those who asked that i hated the book it was then i realized what a great job waldman had done she has created a character and written a story that gives the reader a visceral reaction in this case disgust i didn't hate the book i hated nate piven while i found her writing to be somewhat too detailed at times and i worry about the unfortunate perceptions that can be gathered about a man's thoughts on love i feel that the author produced a solid piece on relationships and a study into the mind of a certain type of person","1051":"insight into the male mind written by a female author profound and provocative","1052":"it's really interesting the way she completely gets into the head of a man i really kept thinking a man must've written it she also got the nuances of the female characters too i thought she did an amazing job it didn't read like a first book and it gave a window into the ny world of the intellectuals u0026amp dating i especially liked the last half","1053":"i did enjoy this one but the ending and last chapter are going to bug me for a few more days possible alternate title a portrait of an asshole who is convinced he's not an asshole","1054":"i didn't like most of the characters in the book but feel that they tell a very true story of modern day dating i thought nate was shallow and narcissistic protagonist but he definitely pulled me into the plot","1055":"i listened to this on audible i had quite a bit of trouble with the character of nate he believes in his superior intelligence but he's shallow he's superficial and he's unaware of his own feelings he doesn't know what he wants in a woman one of the passages that really annoyed me was when he fixated on the loose flesh under his girlfriend's arms the same girlfriend who he earlier described as almost too thin is suddenly not working hard enough at pilates and he is repulsed by her to a degree that's beyond comprehension i'm sure my mouth hung open in disbelief while i listened to this portion of the book i was frustrated by nate because i kept wondering do men really think this way certainly his actions were familiar to those i'd encountered in my dating life while dating one woman he became more and more critical and she tried harder and harder to please him which resulted in him feeling contempt for her this book may be written by a woman but i have to believe that she has some insight into the mind of shallow rude men i only kept listening to see if nate got his comeuppance the performance of the reader nick podehl didn't help matters several times the inflection he used for a character's voice didn't match the description of the tone that the character was supposed to have used which made me wonder about the direction and the editing as well worst of all he doesn't know how to voice female characters all his female characters sounded like stereotypically bitchy lisping gay men instead of women and the voice for a particular character wasn't consistent throughout the read i can't recommend the audio version of this book for that reason alone","1056":"there is no story here you can imagine this as a cheap phoned in 90s rom com maybe but that's as much plot as you're going to get instead you have an intricately fascinating character piece of the eponymous nate who is so smart and so dumb i loved him he was observant and clever and logical and perfectly captures what it's like to get in your own head and then slowly i realize all the mistakes he's making although he never does and that is what's so magical about this book you see through a character's eyes but you see what he doesn't see i think every woman knows a man like nate he's so smart he should be smarter than this does he act this way on purpose he must because he's so smart but it's so difficult to observe yourself like you observe the world nate can't do it reading this book makes me wonder if i can","1057":"the narrator thinks a lot about a lot then he is a cad but curiously i read the entire book there is something compelling about it but i can't figure out what","1058":"waldman captured the male author's self absorbed psyche perfectly she clearly did her research and pause she allowed nathaniel to grow","1059":"i enjoyed this a lot the end made me sad reminded me a lot of junot diaz's writing","1060":" i thought this was a 3 5 star book but i'm rounding up because i finished it with a lot of questions and the desire to talk about it with someone i found nate to be insufferable and at times unbelievable but i also empathized with him too at certain moment i loved how carefully the book charted the downfall of his relationship with hannah and i was moved by the ending it's no george eliot but it is compelling and thoughtful while i was reading i kept thinking about how the gender of the author exerted an exceptionally strong ubertextual narrative is 'ubertextual' a word it is now that nate is the product of a woman's mind is what makes the book so complicated and interesting if a man wrote it we'd call it misogynistic and stop reading but because waldman is female it feels insightful tricky unbelievable amazing all of the above i could not get the fact of her gender out of my head as i read this i liked that and it also bugged me see i just want to talk about this book all the time","1061":"i devoured this book in one week which is fast for me waldman provides a believably accurate description of what it's like to date in new york city's literary scene from a male point of view her precise dissections of the the inner workings of relationships and the neuroses of arrogant yet insecure intellectuals is something to behold","1062":"the main character is both very realistic and very unrealistic at the same time but i think that's intentional it's hard to believe for example that nate could be so perceptive in some ways yet so dumb in other ways but that's pretty much how it goes with the human condition","1063":"i am a male brooklyn dweller i read so i was both hopeful and afraid of this book knowing from reviews it takes aim at all i hold dear like five dollar coffee and emotionally unavailable upper middle class people who care about their produce a lot it was funnier and took itself less seriously hmm are those the same thing than i expected it bashed no gender without reason and brooklyn got the mockery it deserved god i want to move to the bronx","1064":"i almost wanted to take off a star on account of he ends up with the manic pixie dream girl but it's such a clever enjoyable shrewd identifiable read tis a solid four","1065":"i found this book boring and repetitive the main character just talks about women and goes through various dates nothing interesting happens and there's no new insights","1066":"meh better than other literary styled books i've read lately i found myself engaged at the end because i wanted to find out what happened to hannah i have been in her shoes as has every girlfriend i have left completely bewildered as to where it all went wrong waldman does what i imagine is a very good job of writing from the male perspective or what us women think to be it it works because nate is a very insecure man in many ways and not completely masculine in his energy not bad and no big word vomit","1067":"waldman is a terrific writer sharp funny wise and dead on in her cultural observations and critiques while her nathaniel p isn't a particularly likable protagonist he's certainly a believable one and it speaks to waldman's considerable talents that her reader becomes deeply invested in his affairs and insecurities a comedy of manners that nails its time and demographic","1068":"i hated this book a complete waste of my time","1069":"i just thought this was crass vapid and trivial the plot the characters you could be a lot more concise i didn't need an entire novel to hear waldman say hey men are jerks","1070":"nathan is a freelance writer living in new york who has just finished writing his debut novel and waiting for it to be released he is on his way to his ex girlfriend's place for a dinner party when he runs into a different ex girlfriend through nathan's internal dialogue we find out about his dating history then he meets hannah and we witness a new relationship unfold this book is really witty well written and clever i was intrigued by this book from the first chapter but some of the prose was quite dense particularly for a novel about love i loved nathan's voice and this is one of the first books i've read from a single man's perspective on dating nathan is infuriating i was constantly changing from thinking he's a sweetheart to wanting to slap the asshole and then wanting to hug him because he's doing something stupid and self sabotagey i would highly recommend this read","1071":"all around pretentious and irritating although a good assumption of the male perspective by a female author i think i've dated nate before","1072":"wasn't really sure how to go on this one the writing was good but i absolutely hated the protagonist and the ending i was far more interested in knowing hannah's thoughts and feelings than nate's ever i'd be interested to know how men react to nate's character i hope they don't all think like that","1073":"strikes incredibly close to home i've been a nate and i've been a hannah waldman's social commentary is so astute and insightful and i loved how she hit the whole range between lovable jabs at brooklyn and its gentrification to the heavy blows at the insecurities of men and women in relationships and in life","1074":"i could barely stand nate in the beginning of the book but by the end i was nauseous i know a few nates and i can't help but wish him misery the rest of his days with that said the author has talent if she can make the reader despise the protagonist it was an interesting read though i never really formed an attachment to any of the characters i just kept waiting for something good to happen i guess like real life fiction doesn't always promise good","1075":"a light quick read but i wasn't all that interested in what this book had to say","1076":" fantastic writing such an accurate and ugly depiction of today's ivy league and feminism wrought adults in the modern dating scene nate is a loathsome character a single new yorker in his early 30s neurotic hyper critical petty jealous and lacks any sense of selflessness when it comes to relationships whether romantic or general friendship everything i dislike about modern young people's feel good liberalism is embodied in nate and his circle of friends' rampant narcissism and hypocrisy lord help us if this brand of youth ever becomes the cultural majority","1077":"there are many things to like here the writing is confident and insightful and even funny and surprising at turns it is an admirable debut the problem for me is that i just feel no sympathy for any of these people their problems are trivial and totally of their own making their motivations are petty and their passions are bland towards the end of the book nate realizes that to his old girlfriend his problems must seem like nothing more than the trifles of a decadent and self indulgent new yorker they felt that way to me too perhaps that's the point but to spend so much effort on astutely observing and describing the trivial problems of this lot of over educated and under employed literary wannabes feels like a waste of time and obvious talent","1078":"3 1 2 stars is more accurate very enjoyable tale of an entitled cad and his dating love life fun to read about relationships from a male perspective","1079":" god damn why was this easy little book so rough i ran through some of the reviews to get my bearings and by and large and in some major organs waldman is being hailed as having delivered a masterpiece jane austen edith wharton comparisons uncomfortably incisive remarkably observant you'll feel she's been peeking into your very brunches skewers a culture and roasts it to succulent perfection a real make you thinker which all right i can't say it wasn't a make you thinker i certainly found myself mulling my own collection of exes for degrees of nateishness i certainly found myself getting irritated frustrated and even angry which evidently is what i'm meant to do waldman has written a book of unlikable characters in order to render knowable the eensy singular precious inhabitants of the eensy singular precious world of brooklyn circa now finicky entitled self obsessed interpersonally clumsy and romantically disabled by the constant pressure of all the morebetterdifferent and toomuchness of this cluttered little asshole of a town and shine some light on the motivations and difficulties these unlikable characters are experiencing a moral satire a comedy of manners a book operating outside its paper flesh in the realm of social commentary she mentions mailer and roth only in passing but she definitely mentions them on purpose this is meant to be contemporary american realism in the long blue vein of those two schlongs but whittled cleaned deboned their slender clever granddaughter twirling prettily appraising without sentiment or fawning the very same territory that crammed itself around the grimy risible fucks of mailer and roth how do the intelligent couple in putting everything in third person semi omniscient waldman achieves what some are calling an admirable detachment but i don't think it reads as detachment i think it reads as judgment i think the main reason this book skeeved me out and irritated me aside from the dialogue being awful and the scenes themselves so artlessly constructed you can basically see waldman standing behind everything holding up backgrounds labeled brunch apartment prospect park while wiggling the puppets on her hands her blacksleeved arms visible over the painted canvas is that everyone in this book is a shithead this isn't a criticism of course if she's written a moral satire then of course she should be sitting in judgment the problem is that it's extremely difficult to tell whether we're reading judgment through the skrim of nate's dumbassedness or whether it's waldman herself cutting people down into these conventional dismissable categories and using nate as a vehicle to do so if it's nate then fine his pronouncements on aurit hannah kristen elisa women in general are just him being shitty and part of the ride but there are a lot of places in this book where you're like oh wait this isn't a book about a judgmental brat it's a book by one i get no sense that waldman is on board with anyone she seems to hate them all even aurit who even though we are told over and over that everyone is always talking about ideas all the time we never really see anyone talk about ideas except with aurit who for her trouble gets reduced to a distinctly feminine weakness overwhelmed by emotions and can't argue properly which just what the fuck on that like how low is the bar to avoid only the most basic cookie cutter misogyny it is so low is the answer hop it for chrissakes it's boring when you don't even hannah who is probably the character waldman is writing for and around most sympathetically one reviewer supersharply suggests that \"this might be the book hannah finally gets around to writing \" which how much do you love that observation i looove it is just kind of stomped on made lame and tossed aside a book like this about a subject that's been done to death should to me bring something fucking great to the table if you really really really have to add to the bodypile of young white people in new york trying to get their emotional and intellectual bearings i just feel like jesus when i finish it i should win some kind of oh shit moment like oh shit i never thought of it like that at the very very least this book brings paperthin characters and a paperthin world to the table and then it just sets up the dollhouse and leaves you there staring at it i'm already here though i don't really care","1080":"its embarrassing how much i enjoyed this book she had been spoiled by her good looks and good fortune she lacked her inner resources p 133 with her nate went into greer mode which was lighter more indulgent sillier than his normal way being this granted him a certain amount of privacy p 234","1081":"i'm exactly who this book is aimed at a smart girl around 30 who lives in new york and wants to know why guys are such douchebags i'm a writer too i went to good schools and i know a few people who might not be quite this pretentious but who would definitely know some people like the people shown here i even grew up in the same area nate did the maryland suburbs of dc adelle waldman narrates her characters' inner lives like a pro she's no show and all tell but that works perfectly here i feel like i'm frenemies with all of them her scathing portraits of nate's girlfriends are even better than her portrait of him but i wish she'd left us some room for surprise she's tried too hard to present us with an inwardly focused obsequious asshole who's trying his darnedest not to be one granted the women aren't much better i think i was supposed to like aurit i didn't i did like hannah but only because waldman made her impossible to dislike she was just too damn rational when she finally snapped and told nate how bad he was in bed which should come as a shock to no one i nearly got up and whooped i'm surprised i got so absorbed in this book since it's more of an anthropological account of young brooklyn literati with enough detail for aliens to grasp than it is a warm hearted story also sympathy i had none of it for any of these people but i did relate to some of them more than others male readers are supposed to hate nate specifically because they understand him so well female readers are just supposed to hate him but despite the fact that he has no sex appeal whatsoever nate is my favorite character he thinks what he thinks he does what he does and he is not going to let anybody steal his thunder nate's fear of intimacy isn't just masculine it's universal valid or not the last thing any of us want is for our partner to slowly leech our life force away nate's last romantic pairing is predictable but perfect i know there must be thousands of couples like that and i'm cheering them on","1082":"it's true that not much happens but i enjoyed this i was fascinated by nate he seems so plausible","1083":"quite enjoyed this book although i think that i would have found parts of it offensive had it been written by a guy is that reasonable feeling conflicted over that in any case the book was well written interesting and not too navel gazing nate is a compelling character in his own way if at the end of the book i didn't quite understand him or his motivations perhaps it is because he doesn't understand himself but it is an interesting tale analysis of relationships among the literati in brooklyn the characters are well drawn and believable and three dimensional waldman has a great eye for detail and a great ear for dialog i do keep circling around to the fact that i don't quite get why nate made the decisions that he did i'll have to learn to live wiht it i guess","1084":"spoiler self absorbed self proclaimed intellectual guy ends up with shallow silly emotionally manipulative woman because she is tiny and hot for a guy who spends most of his time over thinking there is surprising little in the way of self reflection from nathaniel nate his self reflection seems to amount to two questions and four tick boxes 1 am i happy in this moment yes no if no i will do everything in my power to make everyone around me miserable i'm not actually curious as to why i'm miserable i just know that i am and surely it's someone else's fault 2 does my behavior make me an asshole yes maybeprobably maybe but that doesn't make me an asshole ugh i'm not saying nate doesn't sound like a totally plausible modern man he is but just ugh and i think high fidelity did a better job examining dating from a male perspective","1085":"a very well written funny and sometimes touching account of the dating landscape and the lifespan of a relationship i would've given it 4 stars except it depressed me a bit and i too often wanted to hit titular nathaniel over the head with a book or something slightly heavier","1086":"an exciting peek into the life of brooklyn literati nate the main character is a sharply observant 30 year old freelance writer his debut novel will be released soon and because of it he's enjoying a boost in popularity amongst his social circle nate is hard wired to analyze those around him with great alacrity and with your all access pass into nate's brain you see the situations especially women with whom he's involved this book completely captures the energy of nyc and the entertaining intelligence of a talented well educated group who likes to drink and go out it is a treat to read a hip text with countless references to literature pop culture it opens with a george elliot quote can't wait to read again","1087":"waldman has a very biting take on brooklyn intelligentsia and their jockeying for status some of it i recognized some of it i was very glad i didn't have any experience with her critique is very smart and i was fascinated by her insight into how romance played out among this group of people it was very bleak though and while nate's obnoxiousness and lack of personal growth was believable it didn't make for a very enjoyable read very thought provoking and well executed but not ultimately to my taste","1088":" this is not the type of novel i would normally read that being said i found the narrator an interesting character with a slight resemblance to holden caulfield in my mind waldman's writing was intelligent enough to keep me both hooked and feeling like i was lightly treading water in understanding what was happening overall i would say this is an interesting insight into men while not written in a stream of consciousness style it had me feeling directly in the narrator's male mind i was impressed with how well waldman was able to capture the other gender's thoughts although how realistic they are is impossible for me to determine the examination of relationships and interactions between the opposite sexes makes the novel an entertaining read that i would recommend to anyone who is up for a challenge and is unafraid to deal with the questions of their own romantic choices at least in my case raised by reading it","1089":" this is primarily a story about a guy navigating relationships in new york the novel seems like it may have been sparked by the pieces that have been written about this generation current 30 somethings who have grown up with a you can be anything you want to be dogma and the poor us problem of too many options nate the protagonist is frustrating and sometimes awful but i never really hated him or any of the characters who also all had some deep but realistic flaws or lost sympathy for him i really enjoyed the book i think it would be a really interesting book to read in a co ed book club","1090":"ugh i turned to this book for something light to read after we need to talk about kevin i always have a hard time with books when i don't like the main character and this is one of the most unlikable characters i've come across he and most of his friends are pretentious immature and belittling to women the plot is basically his inability to interpret his own feelings and instead reflect his own limitations on the women he dates wish i hadn't finished it i was hoping for redemption at the end but i think this guy is beyond redemption","1091":" the protagonist is a highly believable dickface so much that i found myself tuning out his internal logic because it was so distasteful i had to go back and make myself reread whole pages the insight into his thinking however was really valuable when examining personal mythologies and how they conflict with actual beliefs and thought systems i e nate refers to a system of beliefs that reflect feminist ideals and sound good esp when touted among his intellectual circles when he's actually a stuck misogynist cog in a stalled machine of a feminist revolution the author did an incredible job at showing this","1092":"the main character thought very highly of himself which was the appeal and annoying aspect of the book overall worth a read","1093":"tough one the main character is sort of a pretentious ass interesting effort by a female author to speak through a man but do all men think so very very hard about women they sleep with it was exhausting at times","1094":"moderately amusing","1095":"this book is just about the worst i could deal with every character being awful if the writing was enjoyable acerbic or witty but it's not any of those things and the characters are still just terrible as well as unbelievable i wanted to stick with the novel because my book club is reading it this month but it makes me want to bang my head on the steering wheel best for me to move on to something that doesn't inspire such violent tendencies","1096":"ugh ok i have no particular qualm with this book in that it's well done it's fun to read the characters are interesting but oh my god i just do not care any more about the plight of being a well to do male aspirational writer who cares and it's hard to give a shit about someone who keeps going on about how they're not a dick when they are in fact a dick","1097":"glad this finally made it to the top of my tbr pile okay piles so i could see what all the fuss was about a quick insightful humorous and often unsettling read i appreciated waldman's resistance to the storybook ending and as i found aurit quite intriguing i'm already looking forward to immersing myself in new year's nathaniel p as seen through the eyes of his friend aurit","1098":"the best book i've read since the art of fielding i was awed at times disturbed by waldman's ability to capture the mindset of a twenty something male in new york highly recommend","1099":"this book simply proves that i never need to read ever again a novel about a young white male writer struggling to find himself in new york this is the apotheosis of a genre that should have died fifty years ago the ballad of the tortured young narcissist","1100":"a while ago i realized that i hate every book i've read in recent memory that takes place in brooklyn all of these brooklyn books seem to be populated with unlikable oh so hip people saying clever things and behaving like big jackasses i have two basic requirements for the fiction i read 1 a plot that goes somewhere and 2 at least one prominent character i can root for ideally the protagonist brooklyn books rarely deliver on either of these counts but apparently likable characters and decent plots aren't all the important anymore at least not to the brooklyn literary crowd","1101":"adelle waldman is my new nick hornby witty and smart a bit sad in that sigh i've been there kind of way it's a sobering thought that maybe all those guys who gave me no reason for breaking up with me actually had no reason still i loved it smart realistic funny let's all pray that she sticks to fiction instead of reviewing books from her bathtub because i'd love to read more from her","1102":" i am regretting giving this hotshot new writer a chance the love affairs of nathaniel p promised to be funny smart and edgy it was none of these things adelle waldman's decision to write about dating in new york city from the perspective of a heterosexual man in his early thirties is this novel's claim to provocativeness i expected nothing less than henry james's portrait of a lady from this character study i got so so so much less the titular character is completely unlikable that doesn't bother me unlikable protagonists are interesting but this guy has absolutely no redeeming qualities and waldman does not portray him sympathetically she aggressively writes him as a dick in a kind of reverse misogyny the character lacks depth and waldman's writing him lacks depth that would make this a true character study the novel doesn't redeem itself either if it's going to be a superficial character study and novel of manners then at least be funny and entertaining nope i didn't laugh once or at least have a page turner plot that makes me excited to find out what happens next no to that as well the plot is solely driven by nate's thoughts reading this novel was a cringeworthy painful experience one in which i feel embarrassed for the author who displays a franzen like misanthropy toward humanity without giving me anything fresh and intelligent to contemplate","1103":"always in american sitcoms like how i met your mother when they were haughtily joking about the tunnel to new jersey making out as if it crossed the river styx itself as if it ran into a dead ground populated with the zombied suburban bourgeois i thought they were exaggerating a little surely this was all in jest some knee jerk response to the eulogising of the grand city of new york surely no people could be so full of itself so full of contempt for everything else the world has to offer but i have to say books like this one make me doubt this these characters and that is what they strike me as most characters at least halfway on the path to caricature speak of their friend in maine as if he is held captive on the mongolian steppes i have to say i am always attracted to the marginal places the unsung ones if anyone tells me that maine is some kind of backwater steeped in oppressive silence i'm tempted to take a train there the very next day i think i look for the uneventful place in some hope that with nothing else distracting me i might there hear the silent hum which tells of the secrets of life both stances are a little naive i guess just as the notes in a musical composition need the silences in between to give them meaning so the city needs there to be something that is not city if only to give them such feelings of superiority but really to feed it with the fresh blood it so desperately needs all the time if only to feed it material for its precious production of quote unquote cultural capital seldom have i read a book so claustrophobically set in one locale where brooklyn is already an outlier some dangerous hinterland filled with ghosts and worse still people who might not have read war and peace what puts the lie to this fantasy of new york as some kind of new rome as prophesied utopia is precisely that many of the character sketches waldman produces the complicated shifting dynamics she sketches so wel between the sexes ring utterly familiar to me really the city folks here in the netherlands or those who run in quasi literate circles anyway aren't so different you don't need to scour the pool of new yorker contributors to find paternalising belittling assholes i can assure you you can throw a rock into almost any which city centre starbucks in europe and hit one the most interesting idea on display throughout this book is set out in the very first pages \"he was not the kind of guy to walk out on a girl after the condom broke \" etc waldman is trying to get at the core of this new chauvinism as with much prejudice it seems as if liberal values have only pushed people's established ideas on race gender sexuality into the unconscious this has greatly reduced overt racism and overt sexism but the cost of that is perhaps that the whole thing becomes more indeterminate ghostlike the patriarchy will remain as long as it remains in the heads and minds of the men and women of a society i mean nate is an asshole to an extent that beggars my belief let's get that out of the way first yet there are some small things i recognize i too had that conversation with a friend where we were trying to account for the fact that we were mostly reading white male authors like nate we too liked to ascribe it to historical circumstance but were also wondering whether it wasn't more and whether this was in a difference in writing style or in our differences of perception nate's problem it struck me isn't so much that he is some emotionless calculating psychopath but rather that this is what he aches to achieve he desperately seems to want to avoid to be seen as somebody for whom his emotional relationships are as important as his intellectual ones this is on display in his stubbornly adamant reminders to himself that surely his book means more to him than his girlfriend hannah does and in his pride when she wins an argument with a friend of his on the base of a perfectly wrought rational argument i particular had to smile at his desperate attempts to have people tell him he was in the right after the break up only for him after a while to stop because calling all your friends to talk about your break up was \"girly\" for nate even though he might not be the kind of guy to walk out on a girl after the condom breaks being girly seems to be the worst possible thing in the world i guess we still have some strides to make then in a sense of course new yorkers' hybris does make this a fitting place to set such a character there is a sense in which i feel nate like mallarme once had it considers the whole world to exist for the sole purpose of ending up in his book similarly art made outside of new york is made to end up in moma literature written outside of it does such a thing exist made to end up published there etc from nate's particular literary point of view which like many literary points of view lacks any sense of realism new york is the whole world hell his little apartment is the whole world it all springs from the fount of his typewriter there is this great anecdote about the late umberto eco when asked about dan brown whose bestseller the da vinci code copied some elements of eco's works he answered i invented him he is a character from foucault's pendulum i suspect dan brown might not even exist that i think is the kind of delusion nate is heading for","1104":"one of those interesting novels you think long and hard about while reading and after it may have resonated with me because i'm still single and have dealt with dudebros like nate before and likely will again but it also offered compelling commentary on feminism relationships in general and the people we wish we were vs who we actually are","1105":"i loved this book because of its incisive observations on young men and by extension young women it shines a bright light on a stereotypical selfish immature young ish man who cycles through women wreaking havoc in their lives and on their self esteem i am definitely not a member of brooklyn's literary social scene but this book had a familiarity to characters in my own life very smart and well written","1106":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here very good i didn't think so until about the last quarter maybe even

or clingy in nate's eyes she has everything he is looking for at least for a time the problem is nate isn't happy with what he says he most values in a mate he becomes withdrawn and distant for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction in response to his withdrawal hannah becomes needier seeking the light he initially bestowed upon her many reviewers have been turned off by this book because they dislike the protagonist while he's not someone i'd want to go to dinner with i definitely felt i knew him i enjoyed this well written book and it's take on modern dating more","1108":" jerk makes good ordinary twerp has kind of a tough time dating a series of beautiful intelligent successful women but manages to get over himself enough to seriously date another beautiful intelligent successful woman woman writes book about man imbuing him with all the woman bred god it was so unpleasant not terribly written but so unpleasant like i need to read an entire book about a dude who espouses every single terrifying impossible opinion cosmopolitan and fhm told me dudes have hates tiny physical imperfections being mothered being ignored being paid too much attention to women who want things women who don't want things sluts prudes everything you've ever been done or felt as a straight woman but that experience has taught me is not at all the case the worst of both worlds doesn't deserve a book","1109":"yes nate is awful but i was impressed that i kept forgetting that his pov was written by a woman despite the pretentious prose","1110":"this book really made me step back and understand some of the irrational decisions which i thought were rational at the time i made in relationships a truly fresh voice and waldman knows men and their thought patterns great read","1111":"this book just didn't do it for me i related more with nate's exes than i did with him so i actually dislike him as a character","1112":"interesting beautiful prose everything flowed as naturally as possible i had to double check numerous times whether or not the author was a male because adelle waldman seems to navigate the waters of the male intellectual douchebag's mind really creepily however i have trouble understanding whether or not this book is meant to be a satire i appreciate the point not being heavy handed and everything but nathaniel is way too dislikable a main character to have everything constantly given to him with so little emotional repercussions or just any comeuppance in general granted i do understand that's true to real life for the so called social elite the character hanna seems to be a write in for the reader the only rational half way decent character you can root for the entire text through with the exception of maybe aurit for anyone that's ever been slighted by someone unattractive that seemed pretty good despite their general air of prentention and well bred background this is certainly the book for you it'll take you through every disappointment and rage you experienced while dating this person and give you a first hand glimpse into every shallow callous and petty thought they ever had about you while you were being nothing but well meaning and maybe too understanding giving too much of the benefit of the doubt crushes are curses the real gripe i had about this book was the dialogue oh my god the dialogue ever wonder whether or not anyone in real life ever talks like an aaron sorkin or diablo cody script this book will make you wonder the same thing unfortunately i know for a fact people actually are this ridiculous just from the high school i went to alone but it is extremely irritating to have to read through even though this book in my hardcover anyway barely reached 300 pages i felt like sisyphus having to plow through it at times anyway i think anyone with a mild temperment that has dated an intellectual white guy can find some kind of value in this book the kind of guy that still thinks he holds onto his teenage ideals of compassion but over intellectualizes it now to such an extent that it's empty to him but will still spout the bullshit because he knows it's what people what to hear who also bemoans gentrification even though he is also apart of the problem but thinks he's above it who has a long long egyptian scroll of a list about his ideal partner although once he meets that in a person is so disturbed by the sudden shift of power in his relationships that he realizes the insane women he dated in the past were actually what he wanted because it makes him feel better about his own intellectual capacities yeah i was shaking with anger near the end a pretty intense albeit sometimes tedious reading experience","1113":"when adelle waldman's new book opens we meet nate who has had a string of unsuccessful relationships and miserable breakups as the novel progresses we get to see why although nate isn't a bad person and is sometimes trying to be a good guy he often just isn't there's nothing earth shattering here but it's an interesting perspective and a moderately well written story although the ending felt a little abrupt","1114":"like high brow tucker max makes fun of pretension while being pretentious","1115":"great it was particularly welcome to me because i've recently decided to stop reading white male brooklyn writer's problem books and to me this read as an incisive and funny critique of that genre","1116":"i really wanted to like this book but unfortunately found it tedious and boring waldman's use of language was the best aspect of the book but the plot if there was one and story itself made it not worth the effort no likable characters ugh","1117":"i'm not sure if this book is high brow or not it carefully walks the line like an hbo series in any case i loved it it is a wee bit depressing but i suspect very realistic it is sort of a cross between he's just not that into you and the unbearable lightness of being or at least it's on the same topic as both of those the disparity between men's and women's emotional investment in romantic relationships","1118":"i felt this was a less clever version of high fidelity the main character was very difficult to relate to perhaps this book is more suited for the late teen early twenties age group","1119":"3 75 maybe it was because i had heard some not so good things from others about this book and therefore was expecting the worst but i ended up enjoying it this biggest beef people had with this was their major dislike for the character although i certainly didn't love nate i did think he was just human and a male and that his actions and thoughts were completely realistic i thought waldman's writing was great and engaging despite there not being a full plot it was a fast read","1120":"low review is for the annoying characters not for the writing or the book itself it's my good reads and i can use whatever petty rating system i want it was cool to read into the life of new york city's young and literary which i imagine exists and is very true to what was described however it doesn't make them any less pompous","1121":"really well observed occasionally tedious all these minutiae of these not especially likeable people's lives but actually very wise and when i read it on the airplane in a sustained way the story picked up speed a pretty impressive attempt by a woman to explain why a lot of guys who aren't assholes are still jerks or something like that really curious what waldman's next book will be like","1122":"hands down one of the best books i've read in a long time a page turner it puts you in the middle of a guys head exposing so eloquently the complications and misunderstandings that happen so often with relationships","1123":" this book is about a young man in new york city he is smart and is having some success in his writing career his love life is the main focus of the book i think the author did such a good job at creating a realistic character you felt you really knew nathaniel p at the end of the book you didn't always like him but every thought and action he has or does in the book seemed to really be something a young man in contemporary society might actually think or do it is well written there was much wit and insights i would recommend it to any one in their 20's and 30's or anyone who knows someone in their 20's and 30's trying to find their way","1124":" lol good nate is a 20 something writer living in brooklyn it's been a struggle to make a living and he has just sold his first book turns out brooklyn is the hip place for the new literati to live before they can afford manhattan or the hamptons our man nate thinks he is the sensitive modern renaissance man nate has no idea he is a pretentious shallow sexist moody bad boy and can't figure out why his relationships don't last he has his attractions and has accumulated a beautiful ex elisa and is in a relationship with an intellectual hannah young master nate is revealed to be a preening peacock and the author dissects him with wit and insight and not a little sympathy the author is brilliant at portraying the cocktail party patter and pretensions of the young highbrow brooklyn wannabe glitterati and nate i breezed through reading the novel","1125":"oh i ate this up not a perfect book but a pretty perfectly enjoyable reading experience i even cried","1126":" possible alternate title portrait of the hipster as a young ish man this is the story of nate piven a selfish and self involved aspiring writer in brooklyn and the women who love him nate you see is what you might call a jerk if you've ever been involved with a guy whose mixed signals and eventual withdrawal totally left you scratching your head reading this book might be cathartic i almost wanted to recommend it to some of my girlfriends but for the ending the author paints nate's internal monologue in excruciating but realistic detail neither nate nor most of his friends or girlfriends come across as someone you would particularly want to know though i thought the portrayal of hannah the girlfriend who occupies the most space in this book was largely sympathetic as to the novel itself it's a character study and not particularly plot driven the ending feels rushed and maybe a bit forced spoiler alert everyone lives happily ever after more or less it probably tells more than it shows regardless this is an absorbing thoughtful read about the difficulties of dating and relating in the 21st century","1127":"glad not dating anyone while reading this","1128":"self absorbed main character secondary characters that never develop but just meander around and this was the kicker on page 49 there is a line he toyed with a whiskey coated ice cube inside his mouth pressing it against his cheek two paragraphs later the exact same line word for word i don't think cut and paste is a function that should be used when writing a novel","1129":"i wanted to slug the guy for being cruel or cold or laugh in his face for being a self absorbed fool but it's great to realize that somewhere along the way you've grown really fond of a difficult to like character i miss nate","1130":"i gotta say nathaniel p is a bit of a d if you've been single in the last five years you've gone out with a nate it was interesting to see relationships from his angle but also a tad depressing quick read","1131":" nate had not always been the kind of guy women called an asshole only recently had he been popular enough to inspire such ill will with this readers are introduced to nate piven an up and coming brooklyn writer with a book deal in his pocket and a long history of failed relationships nate wears his badge of progressive politically correct manhood with pride but repeatedly finds himself disappointing the women around him as he is searches for contentment both in and out of love from its blurb the love affairs of nathaniel p sounds like another story to toss on the stacks of books and movies that attempt to unravel young adulthood and fear of commitment but pigeonholing the book would be a huge disservice to waldman and the smart careful work she's done though waldman uses nate's relationships as her lens the love affairs of nathaniel p is much more a study of a generation of young men than it is an examination of love and sex throughout the novel nate struggles to meld the conflicting beliefs of his parents peers and lovers to form a future for himself regularly questioning which group is right as he stumbles waldman is able to make readers feel both searingly critical and quietly understanding of nate who begins to represent much more than his hunt for love with a hilariously truthful voice the love affairs of nathaniel p brilliantly peels apart the vastly different layers that make up the complexities new adulthood blog river city reading","1132":"what an amazing novel seems so quiet and yet delivers such a punch and the ending is right and surprising not surprising hard for me to say anything about it without giving it away male protagonist thirties and i felt i was led gently but firmly into sympathizing with him which is essential for the story i enjoyed the book simply as a reader and also for points of craft watching to see how waldman kept me intrigued now i'm looking for anything else she has written","1133":" nathanial p is something of a 2010ish version of don draper for the publishing world the book chronicles his more substantial relationships through reflections and discussions at bars and parties at his grungy brooklyn apartment and at the apartments of his girlfriends it is fairly intellectual and the audio version goes pretty quick quick enough that i don't have clear opinions about all the pontifications i chose the book largely because i wanted to hear nick podel read though so i guess i asked for it no complaints","1134":" laugh out loud funny smart u0026amp incisive u0026amp squirmingly painful by turns this was a wonderful book i've been disappointed to see it not being given its serious due even as other male penned new brooklyn books get praised perhaps the kind of serious readers this book skewers don't want to be caught reading a book that's about love u0026amp dating waldman inserts at least one scene that explores this idea i enjoyed the first half more than the second half but the book maintains a strong narrative arc even as it uses long flashbacks and internal monologues to tell the story if you enjoy getting trolled by the new york times or the atlantic if you watch how i met your mother if you avoid both of these things in favor of serious culture and make sure everyone knows it if you've ever been to a faux dive with someone who's used the word epistemic or dialectic if you have no tv and watch movies on your laptop if you have a masters degree thats not a professional degree if you ever capitalize the i in ideas if you meet people over brunch or have sworn off meeting people for brunch b c it's always such a hassle pick this up and give it a read","1135":"i don't really know what to rate this book i enjoyed the writing style even though i can't decide if i liked the protagonist or not i generally thought nate was kind of a jerk but i think that is also part of the message of the book the fact that the novel was written by a woman was surprising to me though very interesting if the book was written by a man i could easily see myself being more offended disgusted and wanting to throw the book against the wall for some reason the fact that it was written by a woman gave the novel more credibility although i don't think that's really what i was supposed to get out of it i read the acknowledgements and it sounded like waldman consulted several important men in her life for insight regarding nate's character i liked the amount of research that the author seemed to put into the book but i still can't decide if i appreciated nate's honesty or if i was disappointed that the novel contributed further to negative stereotypes regarding male insensitivity in relationships and shallowness when pursuing women overall an interesting read and a pretty good first novel i hope waldman writes another book i am interested in seeing what storyline she comes up with next","1136":"the love affairs of nathaniel p byadele waldmanmy in a nutshell summary nathaniel p or nate trying to work his way through relationships and life my thoughts after reading this quirky sort of book it's always fun to read a book where the central character is a youngish man trying to figure out his way through life and relationships especially when the book is written by a woman plus nate is an interesting character he is not necessarily attractive in my mind but he is appealing in my head i have him looking like a young woody allen not necessarily good looking but infinitely appealing in his own words he was never really that popular in high school but rather kind of nerdy and wordy but for some reason women are attracted to him who knew he lives in nyc in a semi dismal apartment often pondering the fact that his coffee maker is filthy but he doesn't want to do anything about it he has had a number of relationships his latest ones with elissa and then hannah and they are recently broken up he seems to have tons of reasons to break up with the women in his life he doesn't seem that honorable is he a typical thirty something he is writing a book reviewing books and sort of living from check to check but money doesn't seem to be an issue his issues are all his own his friends his likes his dislikes all seem to make me believe he is not truly emotionally invested in anything again my thoughts i am probably wrong i liked this book without really caring for anyone i felt that nate lacked true emotions but it really didn't bother him and so it didn't bother me either final thoughts i read this book as though i was reading an article i was not able to truly connect to it but i don't think it was the fault of the book the characters were living their lives in the world we live in just trying to find their way by becoming involved in relationships and friendships first jobs budding careers frustrations were all there and it was interesting so a good book well written just not one that pulled me in this is one of those books that is also hard to review it's not long but some form of ordinary life is happening on every page relationships getting coffee dinners talking constantly talking to friends at parties meetings walks everywhere that was all interesting and helpful in figuring out nate but it wasn't necessarily high drama or page turning probably more hmmm comfy and very happy not to ever have been involved with him it would not have been earth shattering just annoying","1137":"makes me glad i don't live and date in the literary circles of brooklyn unlikeable characters unrealistic love story unbalanced plot 200 pages with hannah and less than 20 with greer and yet i guess those reviewers who gave this book so much praise were the very same self absorbed characters from the book who love seeing their lives in print shrug","1138":" if you've ever wondered whether or not a woman could convincingly write a story about love from a man's perspective here is proof that it is possible not only is it possible it's wonderful this book had me hooked from page 1 and even identifying with many of the life events and perspectives that the main characters face if you're a twenty something this book will definitely hit home for you and keep you interested it is not a cliff hanger or thriller by any means but it will make you think hard about your own life your choices and your relationships","1139":"i loved this book in a way that totally surprised me the main character a nyc single guy in his 30s isn't the type i usually relate to he's sort of a misogynist albeit a reflective one but the discussion of relationships and emotion blew me away there's something about the way waldman discusses how we evaluate potential partners what we think we want what works and how we voice or fail to disclose those qualities to others that was memorizing to me","1140":" while an interesting take on a male's perspective in finding love the love affairs of nathaniel p fail to create an intriguing plot line there is little to no character development which results in a mindless tale about love i found the book had too much back a forth with the main character often thinking about past relationships instead of focussing the story on the one developing the past relationships were more how he and the said person met or why they stopped dating this became frustrating because i found i often go lost as to what was currently happening in the book i actually didn't even finish the book i ended about half way read the last 3 pages understood what had happened and move on i would not recommend","1141":" i'm still reading but i had to say this book is my brother i don't know whether to send him an anonymous copy or what but good god i finished this book today quite frankly i didn't really care for it much all the problems of all the white male writers who live in ny it's got that ny everything here is better than the rest of the world vibe and the main character was somewhat revolting yes still reminds me of my bro don't know wtf that means about our relationship but i certainly see him settling down with a greer who i'll probably hate","1142":"it really wasn't my cuppa it reminded me a lot of the lit crit rubbing elbows uppity party schmaltzing from american psycho except without all the serial murders","1143":"this book could have been a lot more fun if it were more lighthearted nate his friends and the book all take themselves too seriously to make it enjoyable and the prose is heavy handed and unnatural","1144":"boring had to read about some white privilege guy that can't hold down a relationship to save his life i guess i couldn't relate to him or the women in his life","1145":"the character of nate is a great capture that the author should be applauded for my only problem is really disliking him and not really wanting to read an entire novel about him is this the kind of person our colleges are turning out now i have to say i recognized him in a few younger professors i know","1146":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i can't tell if this is an inconsequential novel or an excellent one so i'm compromising by saying it's a very good novel about inconsequential people i wouldn't spend ten minutes at a party with any of these brooklyn millennials they're gratingly annoying and oh so familiar hello early twenties flashbacks fortunately i don't need to sympathize with or like characters to enjoy learning more about them after what may be some of the poorest opening few pages i've read in a while with a i can't tell if this is an inconsequential novel or an excellent one so i'm compromising by saying it's a very good novel about inconsequential people i wouldn't spend ten minutes at a party with any of these brooklyn millennials they're gratingly annoying and oh so familiar hello early twenties flashbacks fortunately i don't need to sympathize with or like characters to enjoy learning more about them after what may be some of the poorest opening few pages i've read in a while with a character repeating another character's name in dialogue about a dozen times it seemed this took off pretty well and had many amusing passages the great irony of this book is that it's about a young striving self centered man who thinks he's one thing when he's actually another or rather he thinks he's many things but he's actually none of them such as nice kind accommodating to others etc chief among these self misconceptions is his belief that unlike women he has more important things in his life to talk about than relationships such as his writing career meanwhile he spends 242 pages of novel thinking about almost nothing but relationships he's so caught up in his head analyzing every word and gesture the women in his life make that he's left no room to ponder his own impact on the people around him which it seems is just how he wants it basically it's a novel about a mansplainer coming of age to gradually dimly distantly realize that this is what he is a guy who wants to be in a patronizing relationship with a woman a little bit less than his equal waldman does a lot of things well but i was really blown away by her insight into typical man woman relationship fights many of the small exchanges between hannah and nate as their relationship dissolves were almost word for word gesture for gesture identical to things i'd experienced with exes nate withholds affection and understanding at key moments when his refusal to engage will be most painful and annoying to his partner e g he also didn't like being pressured to provide reassurances on demand being made to perform his affection at someone else's bidding like a trained seal p 160 who hasn't been there with some guy another great fight is on p 168 he's being an ass due to a chain of events having nothing to do to her though he chooses to take his mood out on her she notices she asks if he's angry at her because he's acting as if he is and he thinks as if she had done anything that would have entitled him to be mad at her why the fuck did women no matter how smart how independent inevitably revert to this state of willed imbecility it wasn't as if he had the emotional register of a binary system as if his only states of being were 'happy' and 'mad at her ' ouch so smartly observed real fights happen like this overall i liked this the ending kind of fizzles and feels a little annie hall in a way i didn't love but these kind of books are tough to end without a note of sappy sentimentality and nostalgia they grew up they grew apart they'll always have that dive bar in brooklyn etc etc more","1147":" this is an odd book it's short and i read it really quickly and i guess i enjoyed it but when i got to the end i thought what was the point of that the reader is trapped in the head of a young man named nate who according to himself is a smart not bad looking writer who lives and dates women who seem to be too good for him in brooklyn the book is mostly about his relationship with hannah a woman who seems smart and funny and perfect for him and that's about it so yeah i would read another book by waldman but i can't recommend this one","1148":"interesting book that focuses on the internal monologues of people in relationships the female author uniquely picked a male protagonist making the insights that much more thought provoking while the author at times falls into cliches and stereotypes especially about women over thinking relationships it is a very well written quick read that is hard to put down","1149":" i read this book a few weeks after hearing about a study which stated that there may be a correlation between reading fiction and having empathy for others the idea is that through fiction the reader gets an inside perspective of another's thoughts and feelings and can then transfer this kind of empathic thought to people one may encounter in life this book continuously reminded me of that study due to the closeness and understanding i felt towards the protagonist of the novel waldman's ability to verbalize what nate is thinking and feeling at every turn of the story is really what made this book such an amazing read for me i was able to see myself both in nate's shoes and in his counterparts this is a very rich narrative with the focus shifted so much on nate's inner thoughts and feelings that although the story is necessary to move the book along i thought it overwhelmingly felt like a psychological case study one with unprecedented access to the subject's inner mind this even more impressive as waldman's protagonist is a male one of my favorite books of 2013 hands down","1150":"this is not literaturenate p would hate it a waste of valuable reading time maybe a teenage girl would appreciate it i don't think i could recommend it on any level","1151":" indescribably bad \"but i'll give it a try anyhow\" honestly the hype about this novel is inexplicable except as the effect of conditions in a publishing industry that have left increasingly uncultivated reviewers and editors so insecure financially professionally intellectually socially they do little but take dictation from agents and publicists the writing is actually incompetent waldman's tossed off unedited prose has the flavor of a transcript of some teenager's tedious oral rehashing of _sex and the city_ episodes the diction often suggests the deployment of words found in a thesaurus whose usage is not really mastered and not only for arcane terms waldman and her protagonist appear to believe inexorable is a synonym for ineluctable in a book exhibiting the consciousness of a rising young new york intellectual native english speaker repeatedly characterized as a cultural snob it is startling to find she struck him as cloying overweening as if there was nothing in the world she wanted to do more than make him breakfast that telltale ungraceful was that would just jar will be overlooked though this book was a year in editing while one is forced to ponder what does waldman imagine \"overweening\" to mean i suppose this might be simply a transcription error it is remotely possible as well that it is some editor's attempt at inserting jazzy martin amis ian incongruities to release a flood of the reader's desperate sense making hormones but a pervasive ham handedness with vocabulary if usually shy of solecism gives the book a strong whiff of childish faking i'm betting waldman just thinks \"overweening\" means \"overeager\" or \"ingratiating\" perhaps because \"weening\" reminds of her \"whining\" \"she struck him as cloying\" is bad enough she's not quite sure how \"cloying\" signifies - imagines it something emphasizing what she is doing like nagging rather than what he experiences like sickening without the overweening that seems to be there to convey something like \"over whining\" this flavour of clumsy fraud as of an not particularly precocious adolescent's attempt to mimic the styles of certain \"good\" but not great writers lorrie moore jonathan franzen while simulating conversations like those lightly spoofed by woody allen's films knowing them only through such spoofs which the adolescent has not identified as spoof arises even more comprehensively from the lazy tactics waldman deploys in her efforts to persuade the reader that her protagonist values literature of a certain seriousness and art her narrator informs us repeatedly and dogmatically that nate is a connoisseur of stuff that's commonly assigned the odious badge high brow from a scheme apparently revered in this novel italo svevo and thomas bernhard are the canonical giants repeatedly named as exemplars of the level of aesthetic and intellectual achievement nate is declared equipped to appreciate and which he requires for full satisfaction in his cultural consumption as consequence of this reverence we're to understand nate aspires to produce belletristic book reviews and respectable literary fiction upper middlebrow\" product on which rank it appears waldman would place the book itself by mere insistence the promise made is this is not crap beach reading this is a novel about the svevo lover this is a novel about a serious literary artist attracted to the exquisite profundities of successful modernist experiments in some way that colors and shapes his life and loves the pitch is that nathaniel p - that initial signaling his belonging to the rank of masterly creations of character perfectly balancing the archetypal and the marvellous facsimile of the unique individual - has above all a love affair with literature - with the great unsentimental european moderns - and this is the greatest of all the love affairs to which the title refers that's the pitch the execution is in every way its opposite with this vaunted love of svevo an authorial contrivance akin to the fetishistic attachment to comic books or tarantino movies that flat characters in romcoms will be assigned as a substitute for complexity like a tattoo or hipster haircut to identify which bro is which with her shallow and fetishistic relation to the a list oeuvres and those actual human affairs that inspire and penetrate them to which her protagonist is repeatedly credited a notable sensitivity that remains invisible to the reader waldman resorts to the plodding attribution of superficial signs of education and sophistication as a substitute for the creation of educated and sophisticated personalities she doesn't seem to have any ideas about how people who really do love and value canonical literature think about it she conveys no thoughts about how such a love might inform the lover's engagement with all things and she cannot depict either the musings or the conversation of her characters in such a way as to give the least indication they have ever consumed any culture product other than bad television pornography the clunky comedies of american cultureworker manners that she plunders for the most overused types and motifs and synopses of great books that zadie smith has read the aggressive and impressive publicity campaign pedaled hard on the promise that this book was about literati for literati by a member of the literati but the book does not give the impression that its author has read much of the literature its protagonist according to the narrator's assertions cherishes nor that she has been present at discussions between people educated in the humanities and social sciences whom her publicist suggests will enjoy the book for its insights into their own \"literary world \" instead we have stilted and trivial conversationettes constructed from the junk punditry of slavoj zizek ersatz \"insights\" about greenwashing or meritocracy and hackneyed stuffy pronouncements about aristotle that seem lifted from waugh by way of hogwarts in this flimsy cardboard set of \"cultured folk \" the talismanic authors and books whose esteem defines nate are present as so many u0026lt 3s as they might appear on social media profiles brand name consumer items to adorn the liker and identify his tribe we are told nate wants a lover who reads svevo but waldman's own prose and narrative is so destitute of any trace of engagement with svevo and she is so incapable of depicting any character's knowledge of svevo any character's erudition and imaginative and intellectual maturation through reading svevo or even any memory of anything svevo wrote this \"read svevo\" requirement is merely an accessory a svevo tshirt indistinguishable from nate needing a lover in prada boots but pretentiously claiming to be the antithesis of such an attitude even in sex and the city or seinfeld from which these ticks come the writers would trouble themselves to convey some sense of what is superior about prada boots from the point of view of those esteeming and coveting them nothing of the kind interrupts waldman's focus on nate's finical judgments - free from any thoughts of svevo bernhard bely or lermontov or any that could have been inspired or informed by them about the women vying for the job as his girlfriend despite the novel's oft declared upper middle browness of concerns and milieux the implied promises that this isn't just more chick lit with lame gender twist are never fulfilled virtually every passage of narration and every conversation in the novel is about dating among urban culture workers every such conversation warms up stale scoops of processed apercus from the chick lit in the freezer nothing deviates from the most passe \"men this women that\" schemes the author and her characters even manage to misread middlemarch unimaginably obtusely in order to transform it into a cosmo dating advice column allowing the recycling of hokey platitudes about dating to go in superficial disguise as banter about books waldman makes this move frequently throughout the novel and this example can serve to illustrate the book's bathetic operations although it is especially embarrassingly strained really waldman paints the respectable facade of \"middlemarch\" on imbecile hackneyed observations about bimbos for anything resembling which one would search the pages of that novel in vain one of waldman's half educated friends would no doubt defend this passage by pretending its idiocy is intentional a skewering of shallow hipsters who for all their cultural vanity have no use for middlemarch but to metaphorically conceal their helpful compilations of cosmogirl sex advice chick lit quotations in its book jacket but that wouldn't convince - it is waldman not the character aurit whom the narrator exhibits nate judging \"brilliant\" though the reader is never invited to understand why who somehow pretends to extract from middlemarch a warning to bourgeois manhattan males of the perils of marrying stupid beauties so like svevo and lermontov middlemarch is noted as more brand u0026lt 3ery allowing the shallow chick lit pleasures the characters despise to be indulged and disavowed but this elaborate this book is good and good for you excuse for more chick lit brain snacks turns out to be contructed in vain on this score as well waldman fails because those pleasures humor produced by insights into the experience of young people seeking sex and love of the sort concocted by the gallon by jennifer weiner and sophie kinsella are signaled as well but not delivered either for all the book's declared devotion to \"quality\" in litfic the obvious influence of internet and television writing conventions heavily reliant on cliches give the book a ya feel with waldman wholly depending on that niche's familiar shorthand techniques for characterization literary snobbery is signaled by waldman as a trait from the list of male martian features as vulgarity of taste and lack of judgment is inscribed alongside clinging fearfulness and unmerited success failure as female venusianisms but although the social media and internet publication's lazy breezy ersatz social commentary seems to inform the love affairs of nathaniel p so strongly it is easily imagined re published in condensed form as a listicle many of waldman's powdered instant types seem so dated one might suspect they're borrowed from lower middlebrow fictions of the 1970s waldman gives us middlebrow suburbanite and upper middlebrown cultivated elites growing up nate discussed current events at the dinner table as a family they watched 60 minutes and jeopardy apparently though some parents read the new york review of books and drank martinis and comic plebs as scenery joe sr thought adding a dishwasher or replacing the old bathtub would have been a better investment but i told him that wasn't the way to attract high class tenants joe jr explained to nate and elisa one afternoon while he repaired some tiles in the bathroom i told him the kind of tenants who pay the big bucks go wild for clawfoot tubs for some of her cliches waldman reaches further to the fifties and suburbia tnate brings up his hokey zizekian greenwash \"insights\" relying on that dumbed down hipster substitute for argumentation in the new inquiry style wherein for an explanation of the quotidian it suffices to declare something a commodity or capital - style capital the mothering commodity and then the narrator who is largely limited to his interior informs us he knew that he was violating an implicit rule of dinner party etiquette conversation was supposed to be ornamental aimed to amuse one wasn't supposed to be invested in the content of what was said only the tone this novels cliches are deployed opportunistically because there is no project here other than the production of a facsimile of some or other kind of novel we are at once to recognize these transplanted midwesterners to have come to new york for those fabled erudite and passionate conversation \"at dinner parties\" among those who were nursed on martinis as children but if necessary the assumptions of an entirely different milieu that of the 50s prime time series they watch marathon reruns of on nick at nite can be parachuted in to dissolve again in a few sentences http

crazy about her and the next he couldn't stand the jiggle on her arms i don't hate that he immediately rushed off into another woman's arms and found a love he frankly doesn't deserve what i hated is the emotion that this book caused and how it reopened fresh wounds i hate that it made me even more self conscious about my dating life i hate that it offers such a real and honest look at how unpredictable and unexplainable relationships are in your late 20s and early 30s and that there is no real reason a relationship ends or succeeds in that it just does some good points about on cultural and not a really awful book especially if you emotionally stable and confident in dating which i clearly am not","1153":" i just finished the love affairs of nathaniel p and it was wonderful also as a guy it was cringe inducing and anxiety provoking as i relived several horrible flashbacks from my own past but perhaps i won't say anymore about that for the moment the prose flowed so smoothly metaphors were spot on and original i remember one particularly good one about a top heavy kebab and the characters were absolutely 100% authentic even though nate is supposed to be a cad i genuinely liked identified with him and was transfixed by the slow motion car wreck of his and hannah's relationship ms waldman is a talented writer and if you care enough about nate to truly loath him or at least disapprove of him then she's done her job i highly recommend the book","1154":"waldman is an extremely deft writer she would have to be to keep me reading about the pangs and travails of a narcissist whose every thought occasions myriad questionings of his intentions and ramifications of same gets tiresome after a while but she's also very good at characterization and if the scenes take place nearly all in the pre gentrified apartments and uber gentrified coffee shops and restaurants of brooklyn waldman is nevertheless an astute chronicler of literary new york","1155":"if you set your story in the 21st century and the condom breaks when two characters have sex it's important not to conveniently forget about contemporary technologies like plan b just to create abortion

capturing the psyche of a pretentious entitled harvard educated 20 something literary living in brooklyn or at least what i imagine that psyche would be nate is overly intellectual and not very like able though he does recognize his fuilt at having intellect and a nice life overall imam glad that i am of his parents' age and married and don't have to deal with relationships that would be that analyzed and delicate i wanted to throw the book a few times but a didn't want to break my ipad and b wanted to have him find a relationship just one that would please him for more than a few dates his pickiness is ridiculous and a bit depressing actually he is terribly judgmental and unforgiving hmmm maybe i should give it 3 stars just because nate is an ass","1157":"as a 20 something working in publishing living in brooklyn and dating this made me feel all of the appropriate feels","1158":"this book is like a long episode of hbo girls except from a guys perspective i only hope the author is writing ironically because i find the main character to be impossible to empathize with he's a complete sexist jerk but a quick and entertaining read anyway","1159":"i really enjoyed reading this book about young writers in brooklyn ny however the characters with the possible exception of one were completely insufferable it made any fantasy i've ever had of being a writer dissipate quickly at the thought of having to surround myself with these people","1160":" i think we've all known a guy like nate piven the self proclaimed nice guy the kind of a guy who thinks of himself as a feminist who understands women's struggles invariably this guy is always just as much of a callow jerk as your average frat boy quickly growing impatient with women's feelings and foibles and blaming them for any problems in the relationship after all he's a nice understanding guy it's not his fault the relationship is failing nate piven is no exception and what makes him so insufferable is not that he's a jerk but that he so smugly believes he isn't what saves him and what makes the book so brilliant is these flashes of self awareness he has occasionally he is stricken with self doubt and it makes him human and less murder able i enjoyed every page of this sharp debut and i can't wait for more from adelle waldman","1161":"a well written book about a self absorbed asshole","1162":" interesting portrait of what some might consider the contemporary intellectual man waldman does great justice to her characters particularly to nate with whom the reader comes to know quite well throughout the 256 pages of the book in terms of her assessment of modern relationships modern love to drop a david bowie reference in the middle of this review waldman rewrites the usual good bad binary that often occurs when writer's tackle the break up trope waldman is critical without ever seeming didactic the only problem with the narrative lies in the writing at times it seems overly crafted and repetitive vaguely masturbatory to borrow a word waldman uses throughout love affairs all in all though a great read","1163":"dialogue captures m f relationships with clarity and precision but the hipster characters are just far too precious to be endearing in any way","1164":"a clever brilliantly written story of a writer and his writer friends lovers in new york city tangling strong emotions humor

book club i just never grew to care about nate his future or his decisions","1166":" whew it's tough to get into the love affairs of nathaniel call him nate p if you don't much care for nathaniel call him nate p and really i didn't at all not that it's deadly to dislike a protagonist poe pulled it off with aplomb first person creep pov but the reader's still there but nate he's just so much milquetoast angst shallow despite his supposed ivy league intelligence and his biggest love affair is with himself yawn as for the girls you can't help but wonder what's wrong with them have they no sense the emperor wears no clothes here it's marketed as a savvy 30 something brooklyn is cool situated novel about love these days but if this is love we need a new word for the real thing the other drag on the narrative is the writing it seems in many spots to be a lot of telling not that telling can't work sometimes here it just doesn't this happened then that happened nate saw her then nate thought this what happened a minute ago is happening again only differently maybe because the girl's hair is longer than the last's or her laugh more affected or her monologue more boring and nate is micro analyzing every blessed moment in fact in one section nate admits to be sensitive to the charge of overthinking things oy small wonder in the end it's just a long slog through a lot of sameness passing as clever social commentary or not passing bottom line no exit brooklyn style","1167":"i would give the writing style of this book a 4 i enjoyed it very much smart and thought provoking however i rate the book as a whole 3 stars the main character was easy to dislike and i felt like i was in the bad relationships with him just wanted to break up with him the whole time","1168":"a case study set among new york's sub culture of aspiring writers that explores the unpleasant intricacies and vulnerability of dating waldman is smart stimulating and enjoyably self aware in a soapbox sermon by aurit the title character's good friend and conscience waldman offers a meta justification for her book's hard look at what some might dismiss as trivial i just hate the way so many men treat 'dating' as if it's a frivolous subject dating is probably the most fraught human interaction there is you're sizing people up to see if they're worth your time and attention and they're doing the same to you it's meritocracy applied to personal life but there's no accountability we submit ourselves to these intimate inspections and simultaneously inflict them on others and try to keep our psyches intact to keep from becoming cold and callous and we hope that at the end of it we wind up happier than our grandparents who didn't spend this vast period of their lives these prime years so thoroughly alone coldly and explicitly anatomized again and again but who cares right it's just girl stuff 79 just great writing in both content and execution","1169":"i can't speak for how accurately the author portrayed the thoughts and motivations of nate because i'm not a man i do however take offense to her clearly misogynistic 2 dimensional views of women and if she wanted to write a book about high brow social issues she should have written a book about that i don't know maybe try to actually work it into the plot instead of pulling the reader into a book supposedly about relationships and then boring us to death with pretentious dialogue that has nothing to do whatsoever with the plot of the book not to mention while it's all well and good to 'write what you know' i'm not sure the phrase means you should make every single character a writer i mean c'mon use a little imagination please","1170":" i almost can't decide how to rate this book i have two very different opinions that are warring within me the mainstay of these opinions though is that nathaniel piven is one of the most obnoxious misogynistic phony narcissistic spineless pretentious intellectual snobs that i have ever had the misfortune to read about too many adjectives i do not care he deserves all of them and more i cannot understand how this author created him and thought that any reader would actually care about how his life turned out no scratch that we would care but only because we would want to see him sitting alone with no insecure woman for him to feel superior to in a rat infested hole in hoboken crying about how he was laughed out of the literary world for a rapid decline in his writing and supposed intellectual prowess he is the type of person that i occasionally encountered in some of my literature and philosophy classes that i always smothered the urge to leap across the desks and beat senseless with their copies of proust sartre kafka kierkegaard that they would reference and name drop as if their parroting of them made them superior students and human beings so the two different options option 1 she created this character to pass judgement on and skewer the hypocritical ways of all the men that fit nate's description she wanted to expose these post modern men for what they really are sexist pigs if that is the case bravo you have convinced me never to date anyone that lives in nyc or that can use solipsistic in a sentence i mean i'm an english major i know the definition of that word but come on if someone ever legitimately used that word in a conversation i would probably laugh hysterically there's having a well rounded vocabulary and then there's just self gratifying show boating option 2 she created nate out of love and believes that though he is flawed he has many redeemable qualities if it's this option i just need one of those buzzers from game shows when someone gets a question wrong and to make it go on forever bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz you have failed to create a likable character let's try this novel thing again i gave this book one star because i'm almost positive the author believes option 2 that makes me sad her writing style is appealing and fresh it's too bad she decided to write about this whiny self aggrandizing man child there i go with the adjectives again she also fails to have nate grow in any sort of positive way by the end of the novel he spends the entire book moaning and complaining about his life and women he keeps sniveling over the fact that he can't find an intellectual and emotional equal but as soon as he does he sabotages their relationship and it ends horribly instead of realizing what a truly messed up individual that makes him and heading for therapy asap he begins a relationship with an emotionally needy woman who will never threaten his intelligence the ending made me choke up with tears of rage nate does not get his comeuppance for his terrible treatment of his ex girlfriends he gets a steady relationship and a new book deal i can't decide if i want to be angry with the author because she created this heinous character or feel sorry for her because she's obviously known some despicable men i think i'll stick with wishing the author well in creating a decent main character the next time around and hoping to god that i never meet a nathaniel piven as evidenced by my surplus of adjectives it would not end well","1171":"liked it didn't love it quick read","1172":" thanks to netgalley for the copy of the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman i should have known from the description that i probably wouldn't end up liking nathaniel p but i gave the book a shot anyway what it boils down to is nathaniel p is a harvard educated 30 something writer who has dated many women but still hasn't settled down the book analyzes his past relationships and then sees him enter a relationship with hannah a woman equally as smart as him and fairly comfortable in her own skin but then of course one day nathaniel's affection for her shifts and he no longer likes her quite as much as he used to and then he becomes an overly critical blowhard and when she responds to his change in attitude with confusion and self consciousness he gets all oh yep she's just like every other woman i thought she was smarter than that i am sorry this is getting a little ranty but i was just so annoyed with this guy it must be exhausting to be so smart and have such a high bar for what you expect out of women that you can't just be happy i mean at one point he notices the skin of her underarm isn't as taut as he would expect it to be and that becomes another one of his mental criticisms of her really has he forgotten that his belly is routinely described as having a paunch i mean look at me i'm getting all crazy and acting like this guy actually exists i was so annoyed by him and then in the end he settles into a relationship with a stereo typical girl that is pretty but likes the drama and magically this relationship really makes him happy and keeps him on his toes oh please sorry ms waldman but i hated nathaniel http thisismybookblog blogspot com","1173":"so the good folks at henry holt and co are pushing the love affairs of nathaniel p as a book with \"the most frighteningly realistic male character of 2013\" at its center it's a marketing move i get that i'm not knocking the wise choice of catering to machismo men and jilted women with the same book such a move can however make way for giving the man hater's camp some fodder so let me step up on my soapbox here for all to see and say \"yes nathaniel piven is certainly one very accurate sampling of a male character but by no means does he embody the definition of male personality thank you \"nathaniel piven is sort of a jerk but i think that's giving him too much credit i think i was supposed to walk away hating nate more than i did because let's be \"realistic\" here the girls climbing all over nate weren't exactly not asking to have their hearts trampled on yes hannah was quite likable and i did feel bad for her but it's almost as if she thought if she threw herself at nate he'd respect and love her ladies sex does not equal love respect rarely comes from having sex with someone on a first or second date but i forget i stepped off my soapbox in the first paragraph so all that being said the characters were very well written because adelle waldman really got into nate's psyche and she did a fabulous job of showing the other characters' sardonic perceptions through nate's eyes nate suffers from a mental illness of some kind but it is never presented as such rather his illness is seen as more of a gender issue clearly the author wants you to believe that being a man is a mental wait no--forgot i wasn't going there again okay the book so i liked the book despite my aforementioned peeve but my ability to enjoy it may have had something to do with the fact the whole thing felt more like satire commenting on the publishing industry and the lives of the literati and if that's the case maybe waldman isn't poking at me as a man but at the industry in general if so i say game on we all know everything we've ever heard about the unlikable chums in that group is true i can't help but wonder if i've just somehow proven that i too am like nathaniel p","1174":" i enjoyed this book immensely it was nice to read a contemporary novel whose main character is a young intellectual further along by a few years in career and disposition yet eminently relatable the book follows its main character nate a late twenties freelance writer living in brooklyn across the span of about a year following a few relationships and reminisces on many others throughout the book i found myself identifying with nate a good amount and where i didn't directly see myself reflected on the page i caught glimpses of friends or acquaintances in nate i also really enjoyed the conversations and interactions between nate and the other characters which offer a sprinkling of comic relief throughout in interviews and writings about the book the author adelle waldman says that her main goal in writing nate's character was to make sure that nate's character rang true rather than making someone that is easy to love or hate unequivocally on this account i think she succeeds spectacularly i came away thinking of nate as a generally good guy who struggles with his own motivations and reasons for treating people especially women the way he does the love affairs of nathaniel p is a short captivating read i'm eagerly looking forward to waldman's next novel","1175":"eh review to come eventually","1176":" i found this book a little bit difficult to get into just for the fact that the protagonist is so incredibly unlikable it's hard to like a character when you see shades of every asshole you've ever dated in him with very little of the humanity but once i was 15% done i couldn't put it down the book is a portrait of brooklyn's bright young things with their book deals and their editors and their depressing romances lots of decent snarky wit but maybe not enough to compensate for the overwhelming feeling of hopelessness that accompanies finishing it the whole time i was reading this book i assumed it was written by a man and that it was a thinly veiled autobiography i was delighted when i got to the end and realized that it was a female author then of course it started to make sense because who else would have such insight into how terrible men are terms of their relationships to women","1177":"oooohhhh i loved this book","1178":"nate is such a pretentious ass but i felt at times i related to him which made me hate myself good job adelle waldman for writing such a loath able character","1179":" this was a good summer read in that it breezed along quickly and was compelling enough that you wanted to keep going it's basically the story of a guy who matures emotionally in the relationship with a woman he's probably most compatible with but doesn't figure it out until after it's long over making her essentially the one that got away the author has an excellent understanding of the power dynamics of relationships and how the things left unsaid matter as much as what's spoken but the best reason for long term romantic companion relationships the upbringing of children oddly seems to go unanalyzed by any of the major characters while every other reason for staying together is discussed to death i'd like to see where navel gazing nate is in ten years probably intolerably sad about the loss of his liberty as he takes care of toddlers","1180":"like the movie metropolitan except about yuppies dating in the publishing business embarrassingly accurate especially when you consider the author is a woman but not necessarily entertaining","1181":"i was in on the first part of the book because the author did a great job at showing how ineffective our culture is at romantic relationships once into the second half however i was tired i got the idea it's all messed up i acted like this about men from adolescence until way into my twenties the pettiness the desperation the fighting the blaming the lack of loving maybe since i'm in my forties and have devoted quite a bit of my energy into creating a great marriage over the past 18 years the book didn't end in a way that i enjoyed view spoiler there was a tiny little bit of growth on the part of the main character but not much not that books have to have happy endings but i saw myself in the bad behavior and then i wanted to get out i didn't want to stay there for an entire novel and this is just a quirk of mine but to really grow in a marriage you have to get help you have to have great help from at least one third party it's too fighty with just two people so i didn't really buy into the growth at the end because it lacked a counseling component i haven't found that you just stumble into a better marriage or relationship maybe that wasn't waldman's point but it bugged me view spoiler hide spoiler hide spoiler","1182":"nathaniel p reminds me of at least 15 men i know i loved cringing my way through his psyche and felt that waldman completely nailed a particular young liberal brooklyn male prototype i see all the time talking about it with my friends the last night we named names of people we went to college with and how she got them exactly right the plot arch was less impressive although fine than the sheer psychological exploration of nathaniel every rationalizing and self justification he creates is both logical and wince worthy","1183":"the psychologist in me loves to read books where i get insight into minds i'd otherwise never understand this although written by a woman provides a lot of information about how men think absolutely hilarious and raunchy but at the same time very intelligent i'm tempted to start it over right now","1184":"overly written almost to the point of seeming desperate and the ending left a lot to be desired","1185":"i blew through this one it helps that i was once thirty years old in brooklyn","1186":"effective compact story concerning modern love","1187":"really takes navel gazing to a whole new level characters are almost all loathsome albeit witty the kind of contemporary book that makes me want to go back to the classics how much more do we really care about the struggles of literary brooklyn","1188":"holy shit holy shit holy shit i am hannah so of course i loved this book and over related to it like woah i would be curious to see how the men she's critiquing feel about it though","1189":" i want to give this 4 5 stars but there is no option to on goodreads i really enjoyed this book it is so dead on about the dynamics of dating that it was almost a bit too close to life for me i appreciate that it is written from the male perspective because i think we too often get the female perspective on dating sex and the city girls etc without enough of the male oftentimes i found myself laughing out loud while reading it because some of the characters reminded me so much of people i have encountered in dc it is bitingly sarcastic and brutally honest the characters aren't good or bad just flawed and human maybe the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it is too self indulgent it says more about a certain kind of person who lives a very privileged lifestyle in nyc than about the greater human experience the books i give five stars to were able to completely change the way i view the world this book was more of a candid observance about a very esoteric kind of world","1190":"i'm usually not a fan when female authors write from a man's perspective but waldman succeeds in crossing the gender line and imagining the world from behind the eyes of nate piven it's also difficult to write a novel from the perspective of a complete asshole and still make it not only readable but very enjoyable all in all a great satire about the literary scene in brooklyn and the egotistical young prodigies who compose it that feels a bit too cringingly real to be a satire at times","1191":"this book is upsettingly realistic waldman writes better about men my age than any male author i've read nathaniel is too familiar and at the same time reminds me a lot of patrick bateman disturbing","1192":"audio book good story of modern post college life and love in new york","1193":"intelligent and psychologically insightful commentary on amorous relationships among young and aspiring brooklyn intellectuals but to what end","1194":"there are nuggets of insight in nathanial p that shine a light on the human experience and reflect our insecurities but mostly it made me want to move out of brooklyn","1195":"i suppose this was an informative glimpse at the interior workings of a self absorbed a hole but it could have been 100 pages shorter","1196":"obligated to read this one due to the protagonist's proximity in many ways i was frankly rather impressed with what could've been a beach read it's instead a rather incisive and well told comedy of manners","1197":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i bought this book a when it first came out with high expectations i was extremely disappointed maybe i was missing the point of the book if there was a point at all i don't even feel like it was correctly titled i assumed the story would be about this womanizer going around dating

until the near end in which this new relationship has almost no focus on i was constantly waiting for the story to get better turning the page thinking that the excitement was bound to begin now usually i pass my books along to friends but this one wasn't worth spending any time more time on i wouldn't recommend it to anyone more","1198":"i never really liked the main character nate and it was only at the end when i sort of understood him the story felt incomplete and unfinished at the end a bit of an abrupt conclusion","1199":" this book is a nightmarish rendition of one or two dates that i have had the misfortune to experience in my lifetime the protagonist if we're being generous here is a textbook manifestation of dating that guy that guy will manipulate your concerns for basic human communication skill as you simply over reacting that guy will make it all in your head that guy will date your friends and then their friends that guy despite enlightened ideals is actually a huge misogynist that guy is terrible at sex the reader is forced to trudge through this novel through the hope that another character will call out this completely despicable human being instead we meet even more useless characters that just seem to tolerate him kudos to waldman for making me want to scream a wilhelm scream in the middle of barnes u0026amp noble if the person you are dating ever acts like this leave","1200":"this book made me feel like elle woods in law school enjoyable nonetheless","1201":"boring","1202":"nate p main character and namesake of this novel is not likable let's get that out of the way before my review properly commences to say something like nate is stuck on himself would be an understatement indeed in waldman's novel her main character can only seemingly think of others in relation to himself when another character in the novel gets a book deal or a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend or children it's never merely reported as something that happens the reader is told by nate that it happens and then immediately the reader is told how nate feel about what has happened this is just one manifestation of nate's narcism like many narcissists nate struggles in relationships he struggles i think because he sees relationships as something that may potentially benefit him it's never about making the other person happy for nate it's always about what the other person can do to make him happy even when he does make his girlfriend hannah happy it's always followed by a thought like and doing the nice thing for hannah made nate realize what a great person he was inevitably for nate his girlfriend grows to hate him his relationship falls apart and nate who says that he has lost the ability to be in a relationship merely shrugs his shoulders and moves on to the next victim so fair warning if you're the kind of person who wants to read about people who you'd like to spend time with in your own life you should probably skip this novel nate isn't a good guy and we never spend time away from him which means it's all nate all the time something i think nate would very much like although he would feel guilty about liking it although his guilt would make him realize how astutely conscientious he was but is nate's ostensible awfulness a problem for the novel there's a prevalent school of thought amongst readers today which says that what's great about novels is they teach us to empathize by reading about people who are strange to us we can learn about them and by learning about them we can maybe feel closer to them and if you're of this school of thought if you think a novel's primary gift to its readers is the ability to empathize then ms waldman's novel is a failure i know that i for one would not like to get any closer to nate p i find myself in partial agreement with the aforementioned school of thought it's nice when an author can inhabit another person when an author can bring him to life and make me like him it's nice to feel less lonely and it's nice to make fictitious friends it's nice to share in a character's triumph and glory it's nice to share his burdens and despair because at least our suffering is mutual and we need not face it alone but i think also there is something to be said for novels that give us insight into characters whom we wouldn't care very much to meet in our real lives humbert humbert is a glaringly obvious if great example nate p i want to suggest is another such character why do men seem to have more trouble with relationships than women why is it that we have a harder time articulating our inner lives why is it that some of us are such bastards waldman's novel gives us a few answers i can't say that i found myself wishing nate luck when i closed the book i can't say that i felt for him in any real way what i can say though is that i understood him better than i did in the first chapter and while he didn't seem like a great guy he did seem like somebody or a lot of somebodies i know after reading this book i think i'll be better able to understand those somebodies and if i'm not able to empathize with them at least i'll know why they are the way they are and i think there's something valuable in that","1203":"i liked the writing and what she did with the story but i couldn't stand the characters at all i might be biased because i have met a lot of nates and they are all terrible in similar ways","1204":"extremely well written look into a certain kind of person and one every woman has met and even dated ms waldman does a great job of getting inside the main character's thought process and depicts a certain type of dating scene in the city having met my share of the nate's of the world i really enjoyed the book there seems to be a general cluelessness to some people in their late 20's and early 30's as far as what they want in relationships and i'm sure it extends to others in their 40's and 50's this article in new york magazine led me to this book http nymag com thecut 2013 11 lette on relationships you've got to genuinely value not only the other person but the relationship you are building it shouldn't feel like a big tedious chore -- like eating your emotional vegetables i think what people like nate who have plenty of intellectual pride might sometimes fail to consider is that the single life could ultimately be as stultifying and as bad for their creative and intellectual lives as hypothetical enslavement to a domesticating nag middle class suburban life isn't the only type of life that can grow stale when someone lives the same way for too long -- in this case flirtation hookup breakup ad infinitum -- they probably cease to grow in certain ways","1205":"usually i struggle with books where the protagonist is detestable but here the protagonist is so entertainingly detestable that i made an exception nate really is horrific but fascinatingly so","1206":"finished this today i almost put it down but when i picked it up again i breezed through it was interesting and quick","1207":"i really loved how waldman put together both sides of a relationship without ever being sexist she simply narrates her story of nate","1208":"the main character is a completely unrelatable pseudo intellectual in brooklyn overwritten and not very complex the prose is chock full of pretentious of references that make the book a drag to go through the attempt to dive into the mind of a modern man brings nothing but cliches and predictable scenarios","1209":"why would i never date nathaniel p let's see because he's a pompous self absorbed navel gazing guy a pretty average one who doesn't know what he wants yet tries to go for it the whole book is so imbibed with pseudo intellectual dialogues that reeks of self importance itself","1210":" really the love affairs of nathaniel p is a good companion to alain de botton's essays in love as both do explore the topic of relationships in a humorous and philosophical manner also both focus on the male psyche when in a relationship nate is a a scholar with a new book coming out other than that his social life is not really going that well he has gone through a stream of bad relationships at an ex's dinner party he meets hannah and things go pretty well and serious the question is whether nate is willing to take this relationship seriously as well on the surface this novel may seem like some type of soap opera and in a certain way it is but waldman does create nate as a complicated character who's worldview and upbringing affect the way he treats hannah true there are quite a few generalistions i for one don't see relationships as a way of filling up my time but there were some brief insights which i could relate to more than anything it's a pleasant read if you're on a plane or waiting for one it's light but not enough to go into fluffy territory","1211":" loved this book it allowed me to re live the relationship disasters of my 20's but from a different perspective i certainly dated my share of nathaniel p's and regrettably wrote my share of hannah's post break up letters i didn't really get worked up about the pretension of the ny literary scene that other reviewers did it was just context background setting i never worked in publishing or lived in new york but i still felt like i knew these characters hell i even dated them i have to thank adelle twenty five years later and i finally understand what my own gregory t daniel k and stephen b were thinking bastards","1212":"it wasn't nathaniel p it was me the writing was agreeably wry and incisive but i realize i'm simply too old to care about the mating dance anymore i should stick to stories with mostly elderly characters","1213":" wow nate is a pretentious asshole and i'm so happy i don't friends like his everyone was pretty ridiculous i felt like they were the grown up version of the gossip girl cast trying desperately to convince the world how deep and intelligent they are i think the only one i did like was hannah for the most part i was able to look past the annoying conversational banter but i started to just really hate nate i also feel like the ending was a little lacking i haven't dated that much but i hope to god for my single friends that they don't have to date the nates of the world","1214":"had it not been our bookclub pick i don't think i would have finished smarmy that's the feeling the main character gives off and how i feel now that i've finished in the whole there were some good lines and thought provoking ideas but not enough to help me like the novel","1215":"i dated a guy who used to always say he was bored he was bored by the people around him his job what the world had to offer even himself it was with a horrifying realization that i discovered adelle waldman's title character nathaniel piven nate closely resembled this person it colored the book for me from then on out though i can still say i enjoyed it when i say it i refer to the book what the guy from my past and nate failed to understand or perhaps chose to ignore was how much control individuals have in the way their lives pan out in this day and age when class and economic status is malleable and ever changing whether you are bored is a decision you have to make for yourself nate finds himself choosing women and friends who he inevitably picks apart in his brain in the first half of the book you find yourself agreeing with his critique of those around him he can explain why this woman's comment was pseudo literary or how he knows his friend is really more into tits than conversation this was also shocking to me waldman's greatest feat is that she completely embodies the mind and body of a thirty year old man in brooklyn not only could i identify with the described scenery i could identify with the just barely made it attitude of a young professional the fact that this male narration was written by a woman and that it all made so much sense well that was shocking enter hannah a fellow writer nate at first ignores she's not quite pretty enough for himself or if he's honest his friends plus women ugh but then allows into his life hannah is smart without bragging witty without trying and nate feels a genuine intimacy with her emotionally and physically when the relationship starts to fall apart all of nate's carefully explained criticisms including the shake of hannah's upper arm become petty and cruel the twist is so subtle you almost miss it but then i found myself completely disagreeing with everything nate was claiming made him so unhappy enter the comparison of the person from my own life had nate ever spoken up and explained to hannah why he was upset no matter how trivial the dialogue would have prevented the judgmental frostiness that eventually breaks them up back to my statement that we control what we create if we're bored with our friends our lovers and our lives than why have we chosen these friends lovers and lives a regular normal to the extent that we can classify these two words thirty something whose living in brooklyn should have the where with all to create the life they want and if they aren't blaming the women who can't help but love them surely isn't taking a step forward when nate finally meets the woman he chooses he believes their arguments bring them closer together because the raw passion of anger mimics sexual energy i wanted to punch nate in his dumb literary head perhaps these arguments were giving both individuals in the relationship a chance to air their true feelings and therefore they felt more connected when they understood one another or maybe according to nate i'm just another over analyzing female with a couple legitimate authors on my book shelf waldman's writing style despite a general lack of plot was intriguing to me i enjoyed it it felt unique in its own way she injected bits of startling here and now details including the tilt of a hand as you open a draw a cut of sunlight across someones chest as they turned or a chewed straw between a set of teeth that i loved they actually made me feel vindicated since i often include these things in my own writing and get mixed reviews among my editing peers reading it by another author despite my bias was something i enjoyed i hated the conversations nate and his friends had they were fake and trying so hard to be smart or again literary at first i thought this was the angle waldman was going for but it continued to a point where i wondered if this was her one flaw in assuming the thirty year old role thinking that young people in lit scenes really talked like this i'm not sure either way i hated it the reminder to this old person also left a bad taste in my mouth but i can't judge a book because it brought me further reflection on my own life that's what books are supposed to do right","1216":" many of the blurbs from reviews of this book go something like the following waldman has perfectly captured the male psyche although i am not male and therefore can't speak to this these reviews seems reasonable what i can say however is that waldman through nate's musings on women has just as brilliantly captured the female brain for a book likely intended to focus solely on the male perspective of dating i feel as a woman strangely exposed read this book no matter your age or gender moments in this book will take you surprise and leave you amazed as how well waldman writes about young adult dating","1217":" i often think i want to write about relationships have feelings that bloom in certain conditions that seem revelatory and modern but difficult to put into words they're intense pinpricks massive tonal shifts in response to the subtlest stimuli not impossible to track but near impossible to satisfactorily address or understand waldman captures those shifts through the perspective of nathaniel p our simultaneously self assured and guilt ridden protagonist a little bit spoilery nate's thinking his cold and clinical assessment of women feels true to life and harmful and depressing maybe even moreso as hannah seemed so unnervingly my emotional and behavioral proxy nate is fond and charmed then quickly bored and repelled hannah is confident and charming then meek and insecure the relationship is examined closely as it unravels but the element of chicken or egg is still there did hannah start to lose nate or did nate start to lose hannah or what sequence of events exactly led to their situation it's a positive feedback loop they're responding to each other but what sets it off seems to be little more than too rapid familiarity at one point the two sit together in a bar was this his life now nate wondered as she spoke sitting across from hannah at various tables in various restaurants and bars ad infinitum was this what he'd committed himself to the night they'd had that fight about brunch and he'd reassured her told her that it was safe that he was into this near the end of the book nate acknowledges that the two understand each other to the point that it feels like home which ultimately seems like the crux of the issue if you don't like what you see in yourself you don't want to see it consistently reflected back you don't want to go home","1218":"what do we learn here about the nasty inner thoughts of middle class inner city 'arty' narcissistic men when they date women that we haven't learnt from countless women's magazines over the decades not a lot what is alarming is how frequently this archetype is pushed around surely in a disproportionate way combined with the new york ness of this upper middle class elitist literati my experience of reading this book felt a bit like the encounter between nate and amy perlman towards the end of the book a disconnect between lives resulting in a failure to recognise the important components obviously this is not a criteria of a novel but it appears many are having visceral reactions connected with their dating universe this book also has a lot to say about the behaviour of women in relationships especially when things head south the strong smart educated girl who gets 'sapped' by her relationship become anxious and needy her neediness in turn further repelling her partner hannah's strong stand in the park you're trying to be deep but you're really not is then completely obliterated by the email afterwards which you just wish you could suck back in on her behalf and then the second email oh dear while the characters are all largely unlikable it's an entertaining read written by a very smart author who is trying to say something significant and humorous about dating and the brooklyn literary scene","1219":"full review at http everydayiwritethebookblog com i am in my 40s with three kids and a busy life that revolves around logistics and work and making sure that the little people that depend on me are generally clothed and fed and prepared for their days whether that includes homework or potty training or birthday presents for their friends or any number of other activities and obligations that fill up my to do list what i really don't do these days is analyze the romantic relationship in my life ad nauseam either in my head or with my friends not that i even see my friends anymore but there was a time in my life when i did analyze the romantic relationship in my life ad nauseam both in my head and with my friends and when i wasn't doing that i was analyzing their romantic relationships i sure wish that i had read the love affairs of nathaniel p back then it might have made things a bit clearer but probably only a bit adelle waldman's debut novel is about the romantic exploits of nate a late twentysomething freelance writer living in brooklyn with his first novel on the way nate is ivy educated doesn't have a tv reads philosophy and has close female friends he's generally considered a nice guy by his friends and yet when it comes to women he's frustratingly inconsistent and honestly what we would have called an a hole back in the day the love affairs of nathaniel p focuses mostly on one of nate's doomed relationships five months with hannah another writer who nate really likes in the beginning and then gradually becomes unhappy with waldman skillfully infiltrates the male psyche to reveal the reasons or lack thereof for nate's disenchantment with hannah she's smart she's not hysterical she's fit his friends like her the sex is good so what is it why does nate start pulling back and slowly driving her crazy with his inconsistent affections and moody aggressiveness nate isn't really sure and at the end of book neither was i but i certainly enjoyed the glimpse into his private thoughts and the insights that 1 sometimes what men want out of relationships doesn't really make sense and 2 men don't really care to spend the time figuring out what they want or why things didn't work out there is such a telling moment at the end of the book when hannah writes nate a very long analytical ponderous email about the demise of their relationship and possible ways that it could have been saved to which nate doesn't even respond which is followed by nate's admission that he barely thought about hannah after they broke up this book should be required reading for women in their 20s if for no other reason than to save hours of emotional analysis and discussion retreading of tired relationship battles and theories because sometimes there just isn't a good reason for why men act as they do waldman's writing is sharp and insightful and occasionally laugh out loud funny lots of entertaining observations here about brooklyn and hipsters and the ny literary scene i especially liked this passage in which nate describes a young woman that one of his friends has just started dating suddenly nate felt a bit sorry for her she was pretty self possessed and intelligent enough but she was fresh out of school and repeating opinions that were no doubt fashionable there in time she would catch the tone of new york her schoolmarmishness was provincial here it was all about the counterintuitive she'd learn besides being pretty self possessed and intelligent enough would go a long way and if she wasn't well connected before she started dating mark she would be now i am surprised that this book has gotten such mixed reviews there is a lot of hate for it out there i definitely enjoyed it and am glad i picked it up","1220":"it was annoying for me to read page after page of a shallow self centered man analyzing every train wreck of a relationship he was ever in the women seemed no better why would anyone want to be with this guy i gave it 2 stars only because i wanted to slog through to see him get what was coming to him but even that was a disappointment","1221":"nate's never been popular and that's fine now a harvard grad with a book deal living in the brooklyn literary scene he spends all his time thinking about high brow things like western guilt and how he thinks that girl in the low cut top probably does have a great personality once he meets hannah he's sure that she is different but is she really enough to shatter his mold there has been a lot of buzz around adelle waldman's debut novel and i for one think it is much deserved equal parts funny and cringe worthy nathaniel p is a engrossing and quick read however don't be fooled by the title the story may be about the many loves of nate but this is not a love story nate for he is never called nathaniel is actually kind of a jerk a likable jerk but a jerk nonetheless he is constantly focused on his work on his past relationships on how progressive and supportive he can be in any other novel he'd be intolerable but here in these pages that feel so much like brooklyn he springs to life while he musing on about how he's really not superficial and that he is just as interested in plain smart women as their superficial counterparts he becomes less likable but more real really where waldman succeeds is in the verity of her characters the love affairs of nathaniel p is currently sitting atop my favorite books of summer list you should totally check it out","1222":" thoroughly enjoyed this book excellent writing by a first time female novelist about a 30 year old guy's 'relationship brain' i came to the book thinking it might be some long post frat romp and was pleasantly surprised it reminded me somewhat of eugenides' 'the marriage plot' in terms of intellectual conversations and literary concerns but i thought this was better and 'truer' perhaps that is an unfair comparison very witty extremely well written and engaging i found nate the main character entirely true to life i was never sure if i was supposed to empathise with of him or not especially as a female reader but really does that matter i was initially disappointed with the ending it is ambiguous but then sure that's life and love for you no reason to dock a star worth reading","1223":"i'm hesitant about writing one of my cute lil' reviews on this one for two reasons 1 i see myself in this bookish narrator that approaches relationships and women in a passive aggressive at times misogynistic way and 2 now anyone that reads this novel or even this review for that matter may wonder in what way i identify with these traits sorry mom however i proceed because there are facets of this book about one man's faulty relationships that i believe many people men and women who have lived through their twenties will instantly recognize and therefore i cannot stand trial the passive aggressive weapons of manipulation the anxieties packaged with being with someone is she right for me am i wasting my time why am i constantly annoyed is it my fault i'm annoyed are these thoughts making me more annoyed why does she seem annoyed now where's the waitress with the food so we can eat finally and this conversation can end the downward spiral of said thoughts on a relationship and the continuous push and pull motion that they create between two people are just a few of the agonizing events that appear on these pages adelle waldman creates situations you'd instantly recognize and she does it effortlessly and accurately such as in these first few sentences on the page try not to think of a time you've been in this situation it was too late to pretend he hadn't seen her juliet was already squinting with recognition for an instant she looked pleased to make out a familiar face on a crowded street then she realized who it was the novel is full of awkwardly familiar scenes such as these i was especially impressed by waldman's capability of crossing genders into a male mind in her writing sometimes speaking as though from mine and any other guilt ridden dweeb like me for a debut novel it's especially impressive and incredibly smartly written so get your dictionary out certainly the cringeworthy modern day look at relationships and general discontent that i've been craving to read","1224":"started reading in a bookstore and couldn't stop stomach churningly familiar","1225":"a refreshingly insightful novel i very much enjoyed the author's exploration of modern relationships","1226":"i wanted to like this book a lot more than i did instead i found it wholly unsatisfying at the end although it really did hold my attention throughout waldman had a magical sentence here or there but not enough to redeem this book for me","1227":"i thought about the protagonist and his motives for a long time after having read it rich writing and excellent character development","1228":"after having read this book i can't help but wonder what means were used by the author to get such good insight on the thoughts and behavior of the adolescent male","1229":"i didn't find it funny despite the dust jacket's comments i didn't like nate but i don't think we're meant to i'm probably not the right audience for it","1230":"the book jacket summary and even the goodreads description are misleading the title character never came of age this was not a book about romance nate is an almost unbearable asshole who doesn't grow throughout the course of the book and what's more i feel that there is barely any story the novel reads like waldman's personal commentaries on many contemporary topics rather than an interesting flow of thought and interactions between her characters not satisfying","1231":"regardless of how this book was meant to be a satire of brooklyn's snobby sexist intellectuals it didn't change the fact that i found them insufferable and too self absorbed to care about","1232":"i rarely write a review so just this writing means something when i first finished the book i completely hated it i disliked the main character and found very little to identify with him but a year later the book is still with me to me this is the sign of good art it has been thought provoking meaningful and relevant to my life so read this book just don't expect to like nate he's like every guy you've dated who's just not that into you only now you can actually understand why","1233":"ugh yep","1234":"i really enjoyed this written in the realist tradition and reminded me for some reason of prep ian mcewan and tolstoy even if one is not interested in the strivings preoccupations and ennui of this particular subset of american society the literary brooklyn there is no denying that the way waldman dissects relationships both romantic and platonic is truly masterful writing is not showy not overstuffed with tricks and wild metaphorical flights but always precise analogies used sparingly are perfect","1235":"was looking forward to this book because i had heard good things was engaging and a fast read but i thought the whole book was pretentious the main character is very self absorbed which is kind of the whole point of the book but i found it annoying and was glad when the book ended there are some interesting insights on why relationships don't work out but nothing most people haven't thought of before","1236":"sometimes felt like a caricature of itself my main problem was that nate was so loathsome that it was kind of unpleasant to read","1237":" waldman has written a book about an unbelievably narcissistic exhaustingly self conscious dude and succeeded in making it lively funny and compulsively readable no small feat considering her anti hero the love affairs of nathaniel p is at its best when keenly observing the social tics and insecurities of nate and his circle of fellow literary brooklynites waldman has clearly set out to make nate into a cad but she portrays him with enough subtlety and sympathy that the reader is willing to stick with him if not exactly root for him in some ways like a modern day age of innocence tlaonp is a snapshot of life and love among today's intellectually and economically privileged most impressively and somewhat sadly it largely rings true","1238":"waldman skewers the mating patterns of brooklyn hipsters much as jane austen satirized those of regency england 200 years ago","1239":" i'm trying to figure out why this book full of wrigglingly uncomfortable observations if you were once a dude in your twenties irritated me so much i think it's because it's a book about writers intellectuals and other brain y sorts that has absolutely nothing to say about thinking writing or anything other than the travails of youngish people screwing there's almost something elegant in the way it positions itself vis a vis the market for books in the book the shallowest writers succeed therefore it seems this book justifies its own shallowness and indeed it seems all but begging for a movie deal although dismissive of older books by mailer and roth i will say that at least those books presented the wish for some larger truth even if that truth wound up just being again screwing this book is just as physically obsessed only without the pretense of thinking about anything more hooray progress if nothing else it did make me realize that the marriage plot is a better novel than i thought it was at the time say what you will its drippy john updike wannabes at least interact with actual ideas from time to time in between the whinging and diaphragms","1240":"i wrote almost half of my senior capstone project on the objectification misogyny and sexism that dominate the protagonist nate piven i'm a feminist and while i wrote hateful marginalia and screamed at this book multiple times i think it's a fantastic critique of our postfeminist society","1241":"pretty accurately sums up why dating in new york is the worst","1242":"i think this was a great look into the male mind especially by a female i was a little disheartened with the ending but it really made me consider what i should think about in terms of dating","1243":" i feel like i'm supposed to hate this book for some reason a book about the romantic problems of privileged new york hipsters with an utterly detestable protagonist but it actually made me think and nod my head a great deal for its intelligent exploration of latent misogyny which is basically what this book is about nathaniel p nate is a misogynist albeit a leftist postmodern misogynist who hides behind a purely ostensible egalitarianism and political correctness so while i hated nate and was frankly relieved by the end not to be inside his self celebrating apologetic narrow little mind any longer i appreciated the novel's insights very much my own small college town educated liberal social circle has a surprising amount in common with nate's new york literary one and i feel that i learned a great deal about it or at least some new ways to look at it the ending however was really unsatisfying but i suppose that's the only way it could have been","1244":"definitely not the sort of book for someone who needs to like the characters in the books they read but good as satire and oddly compelling i can't really figure out why exactly","1245":"the book centers around you guessed it the many women of nate's life for about half the book he's in a relationship with hannah but you also get glimpses of his past dalliances it was a quick read and while it wasn't the best book i've ever read there was something about it i appreciated the deft hand the female author used in describing the male mind and the book elicited a visceral reaction from me i wanted to smack nate several times he's his own worst enemy and if his brain mirrors the typical male brain no wonder men and women have such a hard time communicating","1246":" i know everyone apparently likes this book but it didn't work for me a weird cross between catcher in the rye and mrs dalloway it chronicles a relationship from beginning to end in the literary community of brooklyn although i thought the portrayal of nate's thoughts was crazy accurate and there were some critiques on modern feminism and society in general that spoke to me the critiques and thought portrayals that were interesting at the beginning were boring by the end strikes me as something that could have easily been a short story instead and would have gotten across the same message in fewer words","1247":"update 12 22 14 i'm upping my rating from 4 to 5 stars because i'm still thinking about this novel even after reading bits and pieces of four other books i guess it just really clicked for me 12 16 14 about halfway through this novel there is a passage which consists of the author basically reaching out of the pages slapping you in the face and shouting why do you care about this terrible manchild and his banal existence it was that passage that made me fall in love with this book i think waldman does a spot on job portraying nate's thought processes i've known a number of guys just like him i loved the little hypocrisies of his character such as his disdain for the gentrification of his brooklyn neighborhood but his patronage of the snooty wine store rather than the working class liquor store i liked the endless references to highbrow authors without any accompanying discussion of their work still no idea about svavo and then the subsequent criticism of elisa for pretending to know more about literature than she really does i think this novel succeeds in meta commentary where so many other novels fail it gave me a lot to think about on my metro rides and it's been the best book i've read in a while i think i might actually reread the sun also rises next since it seems i'm in the mood to read about pretentious people and their non problems","1248":"it's a good thing that this book was on the shorter side because i couldn't take much more of being in nate's head this is one of those books with a rather unlikable narrator that is so well done that you can't help but admire it and want to see what happens next being a writer and someone to studied writing in school i have most definitely encountered people like nate guys especially so the characterization was excellent and well rendered i also think that the arc of the story is great and informs the themes and the character well","1249":"the story didn't capture me perhaps it's because adelle waldman didn't seem to convincingly write as a young man nathaniel's thoughts and mindset sounded more like a middle aged female to me i left the book feeling disinterested and unconvinced","1250":"cara was less amused her face was slow to change expression like an old clock face behind which heavy wheels had to turn it took a moment for the set of her eyebrows and lips to register perplexity 152 all tell and no show and i loved it so absolutely tremendously repulsively enjoyable i was physically recoiling from the book at some points nate is such a passive aggressive ass but waldman's luminous prose and her insanely on point psychological insights about the micropolitics of relationships pulled me through","1251":"this book was recommended to me as a novel similar to the hbo show girls written from a man's perspective i found the main character to be very unlikeable which i think he is meant to be but that made it a little hard for me to get into the book still a good read and perspective on dating in your 20s 30s in nyc","1252":"if bridget jones were a dude an intellectual asshole living in brooklyn finding fault with every woman he meets fluffy book with fancy words funny insightful but not a real thinking kind of novel for all of us who have wondered what's going on in the head of that snobbish prick guy i met who thinks he's better than everyone","1253":"i wish this didn't remind me so much of some men and women i know but it does waldman taps into some really terrific and timely relationship issues in a time when relationships can seem so easily disposable great work","1254":"it's always a bad sign when i cannot remember anything from the novel i've just finished ugh this one lacked plot and suffered an abundance of asshole in just one character i guess that's impressive also i'm relieved i never lived in new york what's the takeaway here","1255":"a quick witted and wryly observed tale of modern romantic entanglements and the quest to find one's place in the adult world post college nate is not a particularly likable or sympathetic character but that seems to be the point ms waldman slyly skewers the male prototype who thinks of himself as enlightened a product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and a politically correct 1990s college education although some critics speculate this story will appeal only to 20 somethings i could relate and appreciated the ability of the author to pin down of the subtle emotional cat and mouse that seem ingrained in relationships between 20 and 30 somethings think of it as bridget jones from the male perspective with a less endearing protagonist","1256":"we'll written though a familiar story we have read and seen a thousand times the writing becomes obvious at times and you get a little tired of the moping and self absorption of the character but it moves and is insightful and inspired now and then","1257":"i wondered how the female author would manage writing from a male perspective but she doesn't really for me her female characters are much more believable i liked the ending","1258":"i want to like this i can't get past page 20 it's just not sucking me in i don't care about nathaniel sorry","1259":"terrible book the main character complained the entire time although he did complain about himself too but still no one wants to read a few hundred pages of boring drivel i thought if i had stuck it out the story might get better it didn't","1260":" the purpose of reading this book is the same as watching a woody allen film to fill you with rage that these kinds of self absorbed snobbish immature twits are somehow masquerading as functioning adults running around new york city having long boring conversations about the commodification of compassion investigating each other's bookshelves to make sure they all have the same copies of svevo and graham greene and feeling superior to anyone who wears their hair in a ponytail or does anything at all with their hands ever also the other purpose is to make you incredibly grateful to have never lived in new york city","1261":"although i didn't necessarily like the course of her the author's imagined relationships i like her way with adjectives like a lot a random passage for your reading pleasure or horror hannah had taken off her jacket underneath she was wearing a strappy tank top it became her she had nice shoulders but when she moved her arms in emphasis of some point nate noticed that the skin underneath jiggled a little bit like a much older woman's it was odd because she was quite fit he felt bad for noticing and worse for feeling a bit repelled and yet he was transfixed the distaste he felt in its crystalline purity was perversely pleasurable he kept waiting for her to wave her arms again","1262":"agree with elizabeth self absorbed rotter","1263":"while this book did a good job delving into the mind of 30 something male the characters were unlikeable throughout nathaniel was pompous disgusting and whiny which made the story hard to get through at times while the female characters were somewhat relatable they fell flat toward end","1264":"suck","1265":"http baris72 blogspot com tr 2016 0","1266":"3 5 rounding up to 4i read this in the 24 hours after reading my education by susan choi which is a young female writer's coming of age in new york story so the juxtaposition smacked me immediately this book admitted deals with a very specific sub strata of elitist folks in one neighborhood in one part of one city and thus might be quite inaccessible irritating boring outside its cast but at its heart it is simply and i mean 'simply' as a compliment the story of one young man's love life a boorish young man with his head up his ass all the worse because he believes he is a righteous dude to quote ferris bueller's day off definitely the fact that this account was written by a woman alters how i parse the contents of the book is adelle waldman a modern day ayn rand a strong woman who does not like other women i don't believe it's that simple but if nate is truly the protagonist of this novel then his thoughts and behavior are dubious at best and how much ms waldman empathizes with him is a question i'd certainly like to ask her i'm thinking specifically of passages like this why the fuck did women no matter how smart how independent inevitably revert to this state of willed imbecility p 168 after spending almost half a page of inner monologue being incredibly superficial and nasty on the other hand certain passages seemed brilliant in their insight but when he trained the microscope more closely human beings took on in his view an increasingly unattractive cast they appeared greedy grubby hypocritical self deceiving sex the sexual impulse was a lure an illusion engineered by an animal organism that sought only to perpetuate itself the makeup the hairstyling the waxed limbs and gym toned musculature the urbane posturing and protective veneers of youth and achievement and even kindliness weren't they all merely cover for the pathetic grasping 'i' underneath p 85 whatever ms waldman's positions on women her take on this sub type of men is uncanny yes nate water does seem to find its level and yours appears to end up being a level of hell","1267":"i might have given more stars for this well written little book but i really did not like ok i actually loathed nathan the ending however did suit my fancy","1268":"like watching an nba basketball game where you come down to the last two minutes and there's still no clear ending except the game actually ends and there's still no story boring book","1269":" this book has a simple premise - to take readers on a journey through the dating life of nathaniel piven i want to say that nate p is your typical guy except that once you're in his head you know that while he has the tendencies of the modern day male he still has a king and caring nature buried down below nate is a harvard grad with strong views about any topic his friends are able to throw his way he hasn't had a lot of luck on the dating scene although he has had his fair share of women over the years he has tried dating seriously but only ends up finding something wrong with them that eventually turns him off to the entire idea of a relationship nate is the not the type of guy that i could ever see myself dating but he does have a certain charm about him at times however i would be lying if i said that i thought he was a nice guy all the time because i hated him at times too i am on the side of the she woman man haters club after all the language and detail that adelle waldman incorporates in this book is from the mouth of a highly educated man - nathaniel p nate's voice is surprisingly pretentious and witty and i was so pleased with adelle's writing style i was in a few fiction writing classes in college and the hardest thing for me to tackle was writing from the male perspective being female myself waldman gives a snarky superficial voice to nate at times while at others she makes him seem like the passionate literary whom only wants to be heard and listened to his personality was arrogant and cocky but i found it so promising that waldman could give so much character to a man she envisioned in her head i swear i have met nathaniel p before maybe even multiple times adelle waldman has my vote nathaniel p not so much but i think that was the point he is a little too self absorbed for my tastes and i liked his friendship with aurit and hearing about his various girlfriends more than i liked listening to him justify his reasons for breaking up with them aurit was a character that i did enjoy very much she put her two cents in as we say in the south quite frequently and it was often concerning nate's love life or his lack thereof aurit was a little bossy and demanding but what good girlfriend isn't she was the only one that it seemed was able to talk some sense into nate every so often really you should get lost in nathaniel's world then you might realize how the male mind really works a copy of this book was provided to me by the publishers at henry holt u0026amp co in exchange for my honest review","1270":"i would say this book is more of a 3 5 stars i didn't like it at first but after about 90 pages it got more interesting the main character nate is incredibly unlikeable but i think that he is meant to be i probably wouldn't recommend this book to many people i know but it is wasn't a bad book","1271":"not my favorite book it seemed like a grown up version of the catcher in the rye due to the complaining and full of angst main character nathaniel was not likable nor were any of the characters the girls were the worst of them all who suffered from their male counterparts doubt but also the rivalry between girls this book glorifies how much easier it is to be a man rather than a woman in the business of writing or in life in general the writing style was not my favorite as it was mostly telling what had happened this scene reminds him of the past with this girl etc there was very little plot outside of the love affrays and not much character development as each girl was only brought in briefly and re told in memories","1272":" this is all donna tartt's fault i really really wish i'd read this book a few months ago when it came out when i was really excited about it because it was pretty good really i mean if it had just been a regular part of my reading life i would have liked it fine but--and i knew this before i was twenty pages in--adelle waldman is no donna tartt i'm actually afraid that anything i read for the next several months is going to wilt in comparison to even the vaguest whiff of the goldfinch so this book's titular nathaniel p is a semi successful writer who is my age 30ish living in my part of the world brooklyn at this very moment in time as advertised the book is sort of a catalogue of his dating life for a year or so although honestly it's mostly the story of him dating one girl with a lot of backstory about a few other girls he dated previously and then a sort of rushed gloss about the girl he dates next i mean but the point is that it's the kind of thing i really should like it's set in my reality it's full of clever characters and just dense with interior monologue there's no trickery but it's still a smart read and yet the whole book just feels so mechanical and planned you can see all the writerly seams barely concealed you can feel adelle thinking in this scene i need their emotional tenor to shift so here's how they'll get from point a to point b here's the conversation they'll have here's the subtext that will be revealed and here's the menial task they'll be doing with their hands meanwhile it's not a book that you can lose yourself in not for a moment because the author is holding everything so tightly working it so intently there's so much telling rather than showing and it keeps the reader always at a very sharp remove and then too it's all so agonizingly self conscious this is of course partly because the narrator is so absurdly deep inside his own head but also partly i would bet because the author is too it's easy to guess which anecdotes were probably taken from her life which small bits of banter she heard or said and then built a scene around putting the snippets snugly in the mouths of her characters at times the plotting feels a bit like a checklist what books and magazines the characters read and discuss what kind of people they hang out with gay friend foreign friend where they go for a drink hipster cafe in low income newly gentrified area semi sexy urban dive bar how they talk with exaggeratedly liberal repartee daring one another to be offended by their off color wit and but yet it does on the whole feel very real the shifting alliances the droll conversations that suddenly with the benefit of too much interior monologue take on vast chasms of subtext the body language that augments and counterpoints simple acts i do respect what she did i just didn't enjoy it is it banal to mention that the characters are on the whole unlikeable i heard recently that that's something only vapid women say oh i didn't like the characters so i couldn't like the book but what are you supposed to do they are all especially nathaniel p pretty awful--not evil but ordinarily obnoxious and self obsessed and neurotic and shallow and cloyingly desperate for attention--so even when they feel real it's real with a headache with a patina of why exactly am spending my time with these people i mean i don't hang out with people i don't like so why would i be excited to spend my 200 pages of my reading life with them sigh on to the next book that isn't the goldfinch and is bound to let me down","1273":"lovely writing but detestable characters this is a semi literary satire set among the writer set in brooklyn imagine hannah from girls and her friends if you will centering around the selfish self obsessed character nathaniel and his love affairs the writing is very clever and the author accurately hits the hipster vibe of brooklyn facial hair skinny jeans and artfully distressed diners abound but at its core there is no real heart i think any woman will want to slap nathaniel and his vacuous musings on life and the absolutely disgusting way he treats his girlfriend","1274":"drop everything this is the book you need to read nate's voice was so real i had to keep flipping back to the author photo to remind myself that it was written by a woman ordinarily i'd stab myself in the leg for making a gendered statement like that but i challenge you to read one chapter of nathaniel p and see what i mean waldman writes beautifully flawed characters and nate is the most flawed of all but i couldn't help but be charmed by him","1275":" ay nate is pretentious self loathing self involved and cynical its like reading a big boy baby's little black book i didn't find this entertaining and my eyes hurt from rolling my eyes so much i feel like if you aren't from or don't live in brooklyn manhattan then this book will make you hate new york these type of men are everywhere not my type of writing i appreciate wit memorable lines stories that take me elsewhere humor and loveable or love to hate characters i just hated these characters it literally felt like i was reading some pretentious writer's gmail inbox and its so funny to read that only intellects would appreciate this book no that adds to the pretentiousness of this book zzzzzzz i really wanted to like this book since my husband bought it for me after hearing about it on npr but just did zero for me next","1276":"it was a perfectly fine book but not as good as some reviewers were making it out to be and thus somewhat disappointing","1277":"the first novel i've ever read that i would describe as emotionless that goes for the author as well as the narrator i didn't hate nate i hated the lack of plot the tedious description and adelle waldman's apparent disdain for people in general","1278":"while the prose wasn't absolutely perfect the novel was well written on the whole and i enjoyed reading it in spite of a few of nate's more slogging memories the reason i give it four stars is because it's just so damn true it is full of truth hard truths funny truths painful truths its depiction of these truths is simultaneously beautiful and hideous i know all of these people i am these people i know these thoughts they are mine and those of my friends it was almost painful to read at times the worst conversations in the novel were ones i've had before and while mine may have ended differently there was something wonderfully visceral about reliving them through nate's and hannah's eyes i highly recommend this novel to anyone wants to think about what relationships both friendly and romantic really look like for intellectually inclined p s i also loved new year's written with a focus on aurit she was one of my favorite characters in this book she reminded me in the best of ways of my dearest friend","1279":" i hated everything about this book the main character nate was a misogynistic blowhard who has intellectualized himself out of reality he is really only capable of having a love affair with himself he was despicable almost all the characters were despicable no i take that back they all were awful and loathsome it was also disturbing that the author a woman could write from the perspective of a man so well i don't want to know what men are really thinking i would never recommend this book to anyone","1280":" so glad i am not part of the social scene in brooklyn if this book is a reflection of the type of insufferable people who live there i want no part of it nate thinks that because he went to harvard and can string a sentence together that he is an intellectual and a catch for all women everywhere ugh reading about how he viewed women was frustrating i know waldman intended it to be that way so bravo for her but this book was no picnic to read at times it was boring hearing the thoughts inside of nate's head and that is essentially what the book consisted of i don't understand how hannah could put up with him for more than 5 minutes","1281":"waldman gets the brooklyn literary hipster culture down cold","1282":"omg the pretentious pontification and new yorkiness and all around nihilism ugh this is just perfectly my cup of tea","1283":"bunch of pretentious turds the end","1284":"well written book deplorable main character","1285":"meh there really isn't much that's super special about this book the title really says is all just page after page about nate's relationships and how he's torn between women who are or aren't really good for him that's it","1286":" this book is almost too real i could easily cast the characters with people i know in real life there were so many great lines about life about dating about publishing about new york about life in your 20s and 30s i can only imagine how much more this book would feel like my life if i lived in brooklyn what does it mean that this book is written by a woman does it mean something should it does it have to i loved getting inside nate's head even if it was incredibly self centered judgmental and pretentious in there i worried how he analyzed the prettiness and hotness of every single woman who crossed his path and also he needed to realize that there are other people there are girls who think just as much as he does he isn't unique in the amount of thought he gives topics and he shouldn't try to shut his brain off what he needs to do is listen sometimes to other people and not try to craft his innermost thoughts into some sort of article or review or magazine piece i want to give this book to every single and dating person i know also the cover is just plain beautiful","1287":"i hated everyone in it","1288":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here just because a novel has 6 pages of quotes of praise from supposedly intelligent people in the beginning does not mean it's any good vapid irritating shallow predictable good for the airplane but i ain't got time for this book in my life","1289":"i seriously loved this book waldman's insights into relationships and the way some men view women and dating was really relatable and interesting to me i found myself re reading passages and thoroughly enjoying the narrative and writing style i was quite invested in the characters and sped though the book quickly i hope she writes another book soon","1290":"the author did an excellant job of making me strongly dislike this protagonist what a jerk but i enjoyed the book","1291":"lovely portrait of a certain type of contemporary young brooklynite hipster sweet with a lot that rings true","1292":" this is not the kind of thing i usually read but i read a short piece by the author and loved her writing her descriptions are perceptive and entertaining and she has real insight into male female relationships but in the end for me the halfway point of the book i just didn't care enough about any of the characters to continue sample quotes \"on his table nate's cell phone began to vibrate flailing like overturned cockroach struggling to right itself \"\"they some women resent the hell out of anyone who implies there's anything wrong with her choice no women only pull out that talk about mature adulthood when it's convenient when they want grounds to resent some poor guy who doesn't want what they want it isn't merely inconsistent it suggests an unwillingness to take seriously other people's preferences as such it's a tyrannical impulse and somebody really needs to say so \"\"he had tidied up in preparation for her his new girlfriend's visit but his apartment cleaned up was unconvincing like a career hoodlum dolled up for court by his lawyer \"","1293":" i found the love affairs of nathaniel p engrossing and dispiriting and often very funny i have a crick in my neck from all the cringing i did while reading this book the cringe of recognition yes i've known many men like nate and even dated a few and also the cringe of horror that it is men like these who are making it in literary america waldman perfectly captures nate's ability to observe the minutest of details in others without ever getting close enough to self reflection to get a clear picture he's self satisfied while fully believing himself to be otherwise and so of course he sabotages a relationship that could have involved mutual love he talks a good game about disliking the trappings of capitalism but he refuses to pull himself out of the capitalist value system and so ends up with a woman whose market value matches his own","1294":"i hated everyone in this book the way they thought the way they acted the way they breathed it's hard to pull off a novel in which none of the characters are likable but waldman does it","1295":"there are some well developed characters in this book the character portrayal is the best part of this book actually the problem is that they are all so relatable and universally unlikable identify with any one character and feel both predictable and despicable how uplifting not try to follow the storyline and feel like you've been there before no surprises no inspiration no a ha moments are we really all this awful and boring yawn ugh","1296":" this book is not chicklit waldman does an amazingly good job of telling this story from the point of view of the main character who is male the plot is simple whenever he finds himself in a meaningful relationship with an intelligent woman he undermines the relationship drifting instead to more superficial relationships so the plot isn't complex but as a character study it's so artfully done that i couldn't put it down as a guy it was almost painful to read at times this is an intelligent book that is skillfully written it doesn't go for cheap emotions and it for the most part is shows not just tells","1297":"adelle waldman sets nathaniel p up to be hated and i hated him indeed every thought that ran through his head made me cringe then it made me feel sad for the poor girl that crossed his path and then it made me just want to throw a drink in the man's face reading this book was kind of like watching a bad rom com read my complete review here http anchoredtosunshine com 2015 05","1298":"this book was a difficult read simply because i just did not find it interesting the title makes you think it's going to be an in depth character study of the love life of one man but it's really just about a shallow guy who learns nothing i was pretty disappointed","1299":"this appeared on many year end best of lists and caught my eye i don't get it brooklyn publishing 20somethings that didn't really go anywhere","1300":"i definitely enjoyed this book as it was easy to relate to from our current time period however not the easiest of reads as i had to look up words i didn't know as i went along overall a good story and definitely would recommend to others","1301":"why is it assumed that men can write about women but that women can't write about men wrong--and your book the love affair of nathaniel p proves it congratulations","1302":"chick lit all about relationships obsessively analyzing the characters' thoughts and actions not my thing self indulgent maybe a female psychologist would like this yarn character development use of language bonus writing community in new york city","1303":"finished in one day really interesting perspective but ended abruptly","1304":"has some pretty funny moments and astute observations unfortunately the protagonist is totally unlikable and not much really happens in the book so all you get is him that makes it feel like the book is trying to hard to get those funny moments and astute observations in","1305":"my favorite part was the fact that a woman wrote this book impressive writing painful protagonist","1306":"interesting perspective and well written but kinda a downer","1307":"a modern take on both life and relationships in the big apple the writing is superb and the characters are deep and complex the book looses a little steam in the middle and never really recovers but more than makes up for this with its unique commentary and insights on the modern literary elite","1308":"a bit juvenile but enjoyed angsty hipster boys that aren't really that hip and their cookie cutter girls in brooklyn of course","1309":"did the author write this as semi autobiography with her being the character of hannah that's my theory at least this is another great example of relationships where the women are crazy and the men are just men and we are all just supposed to be ok with it the whole book made me frustrated as i could never form an attachment with any of the characters ergo i could care less about them i would say the emotion this sparked in me the most was the exacerbated eye roll","1310":"i rarely read books like this one and that is because i do not exactly what to call the genre i suppose a period piece and a number of reviews call it a comedy of manners no matter what category it is extremely well written and insightful into the mind of the main character whose thoughts are narrated a raw and honest look at current relationships","1311":" this was a fairly quick read and mildly entertaining having spent some time in brooklyn on the fringes of the same publishing media set a lot of the characters and the steady stream of bar u0026amp brunch scenes seemed relatively accurate if as equally annoying as they can be in real life i guess i had two main issues 1 nate's inner monologues thought digressions sometime seemed to go on for too long and got away from conversations with other characters 2 every single character was so annoyingly smart and articulate and clever that i often found myself rolling my eyes at the aforementioned conversations i get that the book is kind of satirizing the new york media intelligentsia and we're almost supposed to be annoyed with the characters but i don't know it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way as if nate or the author was saying you are not smart enough to read this book and truly understand","1312":"i picked up the book on a npr recommendation not realizing it would trap me inside the slimy gross head of a personified conglomeration of all the worst traits of all of my ex boyfriends so it took me over half the book to get a hold of my ptsd enough to appreciate what the author was trying to do here at first i mistakenly really hated the author blaming the messenger but i got there in the end i can understand the austen comparisons and i think they are justified","1313":" found this to be a really fast read i could relate to parts of it but there were other parts that i felt were overly pretentious do i have to be an elitist brooklyn dwelling resident to appreciate this book the writing style was pretty simple which i found really pleasant and nice i also thought the female author did a pretty good job of writing in a male voice but i'm curious to hear a man's take on this other comments it really just focussed on one love affair so the title was misleading i've only watched one episode of girls but i did feel like this was a male version of girls i also realized that i feel that writers are over represented in literature why are there so many books about writers or is it just that i react strongly to books about writers curious about other peoples' opinions on this one","1314":"a lot of head nodding toward the experiences written nate needs to learn and live by a word we call accountability","1315":"this was well written but not all that engaging to me i guess bc i didn't like the main character who's fairly unlikeable it was hard to slog through his annoying behavior i thought it would be more fun i suppose","1316":"gratingly insightful about the texture of dating mating nate piven is impossible to like but not unloveable very ny lit heavy but not inaccessible","1317":" yawn i'm not entirely sure how this book came to be on hold for me at my local library but i decided to read it anyway it wasn't a very good read nate is a prick his literary friends are pretentious hipsters i wasn't the least bit interested in what they did or their conversations nothing much happens except a lot of introspection i will say though that the author nailed how some men who shall remain nameless escape from relationships by setting their partner up so they can themselves become bored offended trapped","1318":" brooklyn brooklyn brooklyn while i enjoyed the writing of this novel about one man's healthy dating life in nyc's hippest borough i was underwhelmed by the characters themselves this whole brooklyn writers writing about brooklyn writers hanging out in brooklyn grudging on about the ins and outs of finding a perfect mate in their hyper educated thought and talk well it's like watching a dog chase its tail give it a rest waldman is a talented writer and i look forward to reading more of her work in the future and hoping there's more than the brooklyn landscape in it there are great insights in this book about the nuances of dating the meeting and not meeting of mutual expectations the scab is peeled back from the wound of break ups and explored one cover blurb compares waldman to jane austen it seems early days for that comparison but i get where it's coming from there is a sensitivity in the love affairs of nathaniel p that allows the reader to linger on the finer points of courtship no matter the environs","1319":"really enjoyed this hilarious book but inexplicably wanted to give it only four stars in hearing my own surprisingly chauvinistic or was it internal monologue trying to justify why a supposedly feminine book deserves only four stars and recognizing how much it sounded like nate i realized this book deserves every star it can get waldman's novel is a riotous expose of every guy's inner douchebag","1320":" surprisingly smart and engaging for what amounts to vaunted chick lit there's nothing too new here if you've ever written a little read a lot attended a decent college lived among urban hipsters or dated a boy or two at any point in the last quarter century or so i ended up reading it because lena dunham tweeted that it was brilliant and a little while later i saw the title character described as a combination of hal and oran incandenza after reading it i don't particularly agree with either assessment the characters are sharply drawn and recognizable as is dialogue and dynamic - it's a competent comedy of manners while representing and standing for exactly what it ostensibly mocks like nate and his love affairs i found this book briefly satisfying but not quite a keeper closer to 3 5 stars but i'll round up today","1321":"the great success of adelle waldman's novel is her ability to clearly convey the complex conversations a person has with themselves while the characters themselves have unique lives their internal thoughts and struggles remain familiar even their inconsistencies provide insight to how one person acts with another and alone naturally the love affairs of nathaniel p relies heavily on the internal processes of nathaniel to move the plot forward but this is also where adelle waldman excels not in plot or dialogue or structure but in the internal narrative that nathaniel struggles to rationalize and recognize as everything he thinks changes over time and circumstance while the characters may not conjure any sympathy from the reader their innermost thoughts ring familiar and bring this novel to life","1322":"i wouldn't say this was a terrible books but it for sure isn't one of my favorites i don't think i'll be rereading this book anytime soon i believe that the main problem for me is that it didn't pull in my interest to me it sounded like an egotistical male that was upset that there was not a properly proportioned beautiful and intelligent woman in the world that could keep his attention for longer than a few months the ending felt like there was no where else to go and the author was trying to pull it together maybe someone else will enjoy this book but i did not the love affairs of nathaniel p review","1323":"it came off as kind of pretentious at times but that could be because the main character is pretty pretentious overall though i enjoyed it i think the end message that maybe we're the problem and the type of people that we think and say that we want might not actually be the type of people that we end up with","1324":"a fascinating look at the dating and mating rituals of young ish bookish intellectual brooklynites smart well written engaging and sometimes cringeworthy","1325":"well folks this author has men folk figured out down to a tee anyone who disagrees has probably been burned such a realistic view into the brain of a 20 30 something single male i thoroughly enjoyed reading it now off to watch girls lol","1326":"adelle waldman nails the brooklyn bro gressive perfectly you know the type he can spend hours expounding on the waves of feminism but hasn't read a book written by a woman in years equal measures of feeling bad about his privilege and having no idea just how much he benefits from it plays devil's advocate on misogynistic and classist ideas for fun recognizes the overarching social problem of the objectification of women but only dates the conventionally beautiful at its best nathaniel p felt like a rollicking fun hate read like secretly discovering a blog of an ex and having your worst suspicions about him come true at its worst it just felt like trodging through a few hundred pages of terrible dates with these guys trying to pick out a movie at his apartment and discovering that none of his collection passes the bechdel test as you listen to him mansplain the news from the other room so definitely mixed feelings but because waldman was so effective nathaniel p is a realistic vivid skewer which somehow manages to never ventures into caricature it came at a much needed time i've read that some women have begun using nathaniel p as shorthand for this type of man which i fully endorse","1327":"i don't know how the author did it but i wasn't able to put this book down despite it not being a typical page turner i guess the characters were interesting enough that i wanted to know what would happen to them i definitely enjoyed waldman's writing style which is easy to read and quite perceptive about people's characters in a somewhat surprising way i do feel like the narrator of the book was not very likable but of course that doesn't mean the book isn't good","1328":"this book is about a well educated brooklyn writer with a book deal and how he manages to screw up a romantic relationship with a girl that all his friends think is perfect for him it is waldman's debut novel and she creates a wholly convincing title character you know nathaniel p you've probably dated him a great read","1329":"this was a deep dive into the mental machinations of a self absorbed young man in high literary society in brooklyn and it is extremely well done nate is hyper analyzes everything and tries to do the right thing as he seeks romantic companionship however his desire to do the right thing makes him phenominally conflict avoiding and passive aggressive this naturally does not bode will for his various romantic partners waldman is deep inside the brain of this nathaniel presenting his direct point of view and the narcissistic undercurrent that guides his life it's also specifically situated in 2015 brooklyn and the literary subset upshot is this is a really well done work the reason for the just good rating is that nate is really a dick not a term i often use but it seems so apt her he's a big jerk the more so for pretending even to himself to be a good person and there is no other character to really like so i ended up not really caring much about what happened","1330":"bright young men do you feel that chilly wind of exposure somehow adelle waldman has stolen your passive aggressive playbook and published it in her first novel \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" you'll want to tell your female friends that you've heard it's not very good mutter something about how condescending it is to women in the bookstore reshelve copies back in the \"gardening\" section an overreaction i don't think so read the review http wapo st 16miqoa","1331":"really ended up liking it took a little while for me to get in to but overall the writing is smart and thought provoking reminds me of girls but from a male perspective","1332":"while critics and lay persons have lauded waldman's keen insight into the psyche of contemporary males i took her delving into her protagonist nate piven as a mixed revelation i could readily connect with nearly every thing she wrote was going through the head of nate but not necessarily claim to be my own thoughts when dealing with women i feel that contemporary society places expectations good and ill on men and encourages them to fulfill these among which are the expectation to be the more dispassionate member of a relationship the more philosophically intellectually bent at least in the society she describes i e new york city the more practical and logical the less emotional and the more idealistically realistic as opposed to the more idealistically imaginative all of this was familiar to me but i cannot say that it typifies my own thinking in regards to relationships for example in the concluding chapters minor spoiler alert as nate's and hannah's relationship is reaching it's denouement i found much more in common with hannah than with nate yet simultaneously i could see how given the circumstances i could be in the position of nate as well which is to say that it probably just depends on the relationship waldman recognizes and addresses this ambiguity though because spoiler alert when nate next enters into a relationship with greer coen he occupies a role decidedly different and with a decidedly less amount of control than he did with hannah and it was to his benefit meaning that while he submitted to greer much more than he did to hannah greer submitted more to him as well both were willing to make sacrifices because they had found the right person i for one was exceedingly happy with the final chapters because it typified a relationship that was comfortable for both parties in which neither member was focused on his or her own solidarity and personal ambitions i e as was the case in nate's and hannah's relationship with his book coming out and her struggle to start writing her own in large part this was simply a product of time nate had completed the publishing process of his first book while greer as we're told early on already has her own book on store shelves additionally the physicality of both nate and greer was a significant even instrumental factor in their relationship nate discovers that for a long time he has been an object of erotic fascination for greer while greer's petite figure appeals to nate in that he feels protective of her and enjoys the feeling of cuddling her in his arms greer cries nearly each time nate makes love to her as if evincing the depth of emotion that not only survives but thrives in the lives and the relationship of these two urbanites even in spite of their independence and personal success factors which much of modern society claims to be proof that such individuals are not in need of romance and companionship of making love as opposed to having sex or fucking even though these details are quickly fleshed out in the last few chapters the format in which they are presented to the reader is like an essay on a functioning romance while the narrative leading up to them elucidates the ambiguities that make what appears to be a match made in heaven a recipe for disaster all in all the book is short but it's good that this is the case because the format is atypical and the subject matter is not for everyone there's a strong overtone of decadence that pervades the work these struggling writers living in nyc discussing literature daily and habituating a routine intellectualism that quickly runs short on actual vivacity it's good that it's short readers could blow through it in a matter of days gain some keen insights in the modern psyche which waldman is sure to flesh out in all of it's actual ambiguity the format is not the best and the real philosophical meat doesn't come till much too late but it's a fun read waldman will only go up from here","1333":"this book was beautifully written and the characters were brilliantly evoked adelle waldman has her finger expertly on the pulse of relationships and has written a novel where there are no good guys or bad guys just young people trying to figure out how to be happy i highly recommend it","1334":" so i was pretty impressed that this was written by a woman because it seemed scarily dead on and before i said that definitively i had to look around and double check some reviews actually written by men who seem to agree whether or not they actually enjoyed the novel the love affairs of nathaniel p or nate is a fascinating look into a hipster writer's brooklyn with plenty of social commentary on upbringing american cities the college experience and most of all love some of the above i was just not on the mental level to agree or disagree with i'm just not what you'd term an intellectual but it was incredibly interesting all the same nate is a self absorbed brooklynite who grew up in the midwest but attended harvard moved to new york and is now slowly rising in the literary scene with a newly finished first novel and a six figure advance and he's finally getting the attention and recognition he's felt he deserved since high school that never quite materialized the novel details his life as he tries to navigate through the complexities of the new york dating scene and he works through a string of for the most part smart attractive women that he starts out as heavily infatuated with and subsequently loses interest in nate is obsessed with how others view his life he disregards potential groups of friends because of his college roommate's distaste for them he agonizes over dating certain girls usually ones who aren't traditionally beautiful because of what his friends might think he's bothered more than once that his friends probably consider his current girlfriend only about a 7 on a 1 10 scale he's often shallow and cowardly and hypocritical and likely because of this i've seen so many criticisms highlighting nate's lack of likability which i find so silly to me that is the entire draw of the novel who wouldn't want to peek inside the brain of someone like this isn't it fascinating to read about the inner workings of a mind so unlike yours one that you've maybe encountered in the dating world and come off on the wrong side of it's simultaneously amusing and frustrating to read nate's lengthy self justifications for his contemptible behavior towards women he's stuck in a vicious cycle he wants to date someone independent and without low self esteem and he's suffocated by the thought of neediness and responsibility but his behavior to counteract these fears causes the girl's insecurities in the first place causes her to cling on and tolerate poor treatment which in turn triggers his annoyance that she would allow herself to be treated in such a way that she's self victimizing you just want to shake him because you can see a glimmer of the potential he has to be more on the lovable side of the lovable jerk but he just ends up acting on his cruelest impulses if all of this sounds stuffy and unbearable it's really not mostly because of adelle waldman's simple yet effective prose there's nothing flowery here no grand descriptions but it's direct and witty and clean and i will definitely be picking up whatever she decides to write next","1335":"9 1 2 weeks this is not this isn't even another 9 1 2 weeks a dull book i tried to like","1336":"gets a few tracts of the landscape of male treachery right but i suspect the writer was trying so hard to avoid comparisons to real people nate u0026amp greer cohen seem an awful lot like keith gessen and emily gould that she stinted on some of the details that would have enriched a book that features little beyond hey lookame i know how guys think it also would have been nice to see nate come to serious physical harm at some point","1337":"explores a very specific demographic brooklyn literary scene but sooo well written it gave me a window into my pretend parallel life in which i moved to nyc instead of dc after changing my college major from business to english of course the male protagonist is nothing if not feckless but oddly sympathetic in waldman's capable hands","1338":"after nathaniel p and olive kitteridge i'm beginning to think that only women should be allowed to write books it seems that the books i've been reading by male writers are all so self important and heavy while books like this one are lighter and truer my only problem with tla of nathaniel p is the reaction to it the idea that nathaniel p is some sort of player or sociopath if he is then most of the males i know are i took this book to be a strikingly accurate portrayal of how the male brain works which people may not like but is no less true for that fact","1339":"i had to force myself to finish it because the milieu was so far from my own and so precious but i found it worthwhile as it came into the home stretch part of the fun and frustration of the book is figuring out what is satirical the main character's flaws are on total display due to the author's incredible writing ability but it's hard to know what you're supposed to see as a flaw","1340":"i've never hated a narrator as much as i hated nate he is the ultimate d bag egotistical jerk that every girl should avoid but for some reason are drawn to him i really just wanted him to get hit by a bus i was relieved when this book ended the only reason i gave it two stars was because the writing was great i did get drawn into that","1341":"i was expecting more to be honest this book did have it's character moments where i thought i've met this person and all their little foibles and shortcomings rang true nowhere near enough though bit disappointed","1342":" i'm not sure about my four star rating maybe it was a five star book i stayed up late last night finishing it and thought of it during the day when i wasn't reading wondering how nate and hannah's relationship would end also disclaimer i'd never heard of svevo until now and in general this book made me feel like a poorly read midwestern house mouse a mom who likes to read middlebrow fiction i hate that term middlebrow is this book middlebrow what about edith wharton everyone's already said everything there is to say about nate but i will mention a couple of things i haven't seen elsewhere first off nate's relationship with his mother his mom who undoubtedly passed down her love of literature to him his mom who perhaps does not really love her husband nate's father his mother who thinks of nate's father like anna karenina thought of her husband kind good stifling so nate doesn't want a relationship like that does he pity his father or his mother or both notably ms waldman has an impressive vocabulary i had to look up some words one convenience of a kindle sometimes her vocabulary annoyed me like when she used the word risibly instead of laughably why did she do that was risibly really the first word that came to her i suppose nate would have used risibly yeah he would have the men in this book were awful especially nate and his friend jason ick ick awful other reviews have said waldman was kind or at least fair to nate and in some ways she was in other ways she skewered him the scene in hannah's bedroom where she invites him to brunch with a friend of hers is particularly painful by the end of the book the reader is somehow left with a big picture of nate you start off small a young man walking through a crowd accosted by a former now angry lover and slowly over the course of the book it's like the camera pans out and you see nate for who he really is and it isn't pretty","1343":" boy i sure didn't enjoy reading this book nate the protagonist is a self absorbed humorless pseudo intellectual who drips with contempt for women on every page i couldn't wait to finish this book so i didn't have to spend another moment with this man child and his unlikable circle of friends much has been said of adelle waldman getting inside the modern man's head but i guess that means the modern man is a real dick if you want to spend time with hip singles in brooklyn watch girls the writing is better","1344":"i liked this one so much better than most of the young man finding love in brooklyn books i've read tried to read she hits a nice balance where you can understand why nathaniel acts the way he does but you can also tell the author doesn't endorse it","1345":"i read the whole book hoping that at some point nathaniel p would have some revelatory experience that would lead him to evolve into a better person nope he was just an ass","1346":"funny insightful and engaging book i really enjoyed waldman's language and writing style if you're in a relationship or have been in one this is a helpful not self help book with a thoughtful and strangely relatable male perspective on dating and why things work or don't you'll find yourself taking sides but learning hopefully how to better handle engagements with the other sex","1347":" stars because lauren told me to it was actually hard to figure out how to star this book i was caught up in the story and read it quickly getting annoyed when i had to put it down not that anything particularly exciting was happening it's not a plot driven story someone described my taste in movies as \"people talking a lot and nothing much happening \" and sometimes that holds true for my taste in books as well it's a commentary on relationships both romantic and platonic in general on power dynamics and sexism and what attracts people to one another and what people find attractive about themselves and that's what appealed to me the narration is smart and funny some characters made me nod i so know that person some of the characters and their relationships seemed brutally accurate that thing where you know you're doing something you shouldn't and you know why you're doing it and why you shouldn't and you continue to do it there was a lot of that but the story is sometimes painful to read and i wanted to give the main character a good shake more than once i know i know that was the point but it still frustrates me when i'm reading i generally want to like the person i'm reading about and nate wasn't totally unlikeable there was a certain self awareness that was redeeming little moments of niceness so i did keep reading and i'll keep reading waldman i'm looking forward to her next novel","1348":"hit fairly close to home enjoyed it a lot thought the ending was a little strange underdeveloped","1349":" i whipped through this book faster than any this year except for lemony snicket it's illuminating a peek inside a certain male brain so convincing in fact that i might have to go on a meditation retreat to convince myself it is not the depiction of all male brains there are bits of the book that might later be excerpted and put forth as philosophy given the fast pace of our world it could happen soon so keep a look out it was so well rounded and full i felt myself identifying with many of the characters even the gray tinged morality of the narrator matthew weiner could take some notes for don draper etc this nate relies on his unreliable gut to divine his fate then uses his big brain to rationalize the moves except he skipped the step where he examines what seminal experiences have shaped this gut decider to step back and question it that's the part that he can't and chooses not to outsmart i can't wait for the next adelle waldman novel thank you","1350":"another book about a self centered intellectual jerk who loves hearing the sound of his own voice only this time written by a woman how edgy","1351":"i can relate to the book as a young professional living in brooklyn which is why i gravitated towards the book but it was a slow read and overall not very interesting","1352":"nathaniel p is a twat","1353":" even though this was not a very plot driven book i still really enjoyed it i feel like the author really understands and captured the mindset of a certain specific group of new yorkers very well or maybe it's more accurate to say that i believe that the real life counterparts of the men in her story do actually think and behave in this way nate was a dbag most of the time but was also at times not a total villain and really only as shallow and vain as we all fear we are at some point waldman really captured how small cracks in a relationship become chasms when one half of the pair doesn't want to address them and the fact that nate's so self righteous about his role or lack thereof in the thorniness of the relationship is spot on i sort of hate that i agreed with and understood his point of view as often as i did but am ultimately glad that i was on hannah's side basically the entire time","1354":"more like a 2 5 well written but tedious and mundane book about dating mostly from a male perspective not worth thee read","1355":"why why why do i not keep my resolve to sticking with book recommendations from my friends on goodreads this book had no plot r rated language and subject matter and was filled with pretentious self absorbed characters who feel morally and intellectually superior to all those around them","1356":" just read claire harlan orsi's review of this novel because i basically agree with all of it mostly i thought this book was pretty smart one could even say austen esque about how gender dynamics operate within a very specific population rich straight white hypereducated thirtysomething brooklyn writers as claire has observed although this book spends a great deal of time inside the mind of a real world class asshole the novel spends almost no time on how this person and all his friends can afford to live in brooklyn while struggling to break through as freelance writers if they're all subsidized by their wealthy families it seems that would be deserving of some space in the novel considering that a major motif is the market of both the publishing and dating worlds also while i have been told that the book uses satire to critique the main character's privileged and misogynist habits of mind i once again really struggled to understand the satire this is just a thing does anyone have any recommendations for very elementary satirical novels that i can read then maybe i can work my way up","1357":"loved it until the ending","1358":"good book and painfully realistic having dated a narcissist i cringed at how nate's mind worked meanwhile the women are gas lighted into thinking there is something wrong with them a very familiar theme for those who haven't come across such a man be grateful","1359":" note to self find the author and figure out if she really actually is a woman i wish i could think like a man as someone who is not characteristically good at relationships i found several passages to be pretty insightful setting 9 10characters 8 10 peter and eugene were of the necessary but boring pawn type characters juliet's character seemed useless plot 7 10 confusing and twisty turny at times but just as life is ending 5 10 mehhh i'm sensing a cop outi will be buying this book it's sort of timeless in a way the story and the characters could be anyone anywhere and my emotional response would likely be the same finally a book about real life p s finally a book about relationships that neither outright shames men nor points and laughs at women write more adelle","1360":"i had a lot of feelings about this book some good and some bad it is very well written the main character feels eerily realistic and familiar still it was kind of a bleak view on men and dating and love enough so that i'm not exactly sure if reading it was a pleasant experience very interesting either way though","1361":"am utterly diverting read about a time of life i would rather forget thank god i married young and didn't have to go through the horror show of the nyc dating scene my fav adult book reviewer sums it up better than i ever could http www washingtonpost com enterta","1362":" i'm so glad this was a quick read the entire story felt like an extended exercise in navel gazing the main character is very clinical self absorbed arrogant and incredibly self contained there is no real plot beyond watching him spiral down the path of self destructing all of his relationships the only other characters are a handful of friends who come and go intermittently the book just felt so limited and constricted as if the author wouldn't truly allow herself to speak as the character rather she had a point or several points she wanted to make and moved her characters to accommodate","1363":"i just wasn't a huge fan of this one and i think i'm the target age group and can on some level relate to the characters it was about too specific of a kind of person to me and i think a lot of the narration just didn't ring true that said it kept me interested i guess i'm currently into more plot driven books this definitely isn't one of those","1364":" interesting views on modern gender roles in relationships but ther point of view chosen was poorly executed in my opinion as a modern man in the city myself i thought i would be able to identify with nate at the beginning of the novel he seems like a fairly decent guy who is thoughtful in relationships but still thinks like a guy at the end of the novel though i couldn't feel farther away from his thinking i don't think waldman captured the perspective of the modern man no man thinks this much about gender roles and although it is a great way to address them it got fairly annoying that every action was followed by an gender analysis i just couldnt help but think that this was just a different way to address modern feminism","1365":"achingly familiar","1366":"not sure how this book is supposed to make you feel about its main character sympathize with him hate him","1367":" i gave this three stars but it's more like 4 1 as a couple character studies thrown tied together it was occasionally brilliant and terrifyingly perceptive as a novel about human beings it didn't really work the plot can basically be summarized as young writer in brooklyn has a bad relationship because even though he tries not to be he is kind of a dick but beyond that it is really good about inner monologues and thought processes and the general experience of being a sensitive intellectual liberal new york male type person sometimes mr p is super perceptive and thoughtful and sometimes he is just totally self absorbed and oblivious i guess that is true of a lot of people but he was really oblivious at really really annoying times also the ending no spoilers drove me nuts the sentence about who calls people philistines any more struck a little too close to home","1368":"i feel like i should have liked this book more than i did the writing was good some of it was excellent the story is told from the point of view of nate a young brooklyn writer who is trying to sort out his relationships with women and to a lesser extent with his friends we spend the whole book inside nate's head at first this seemed fine but as the story went on the voice started to feel inauthentic is this really his innermost thoughts on what is happening to him how could a person who has no more insight into his own feelings than that be a novelist if the story had been in the third person i think it wouldn't have bothered me that nate was so superficial but if he is superficial in his own mind how can i as the reader be that interested in him","1369":"well this absolutely destroyed me","1370":" someone at book club compared this to an episode of the tv show girls which i thought was pretty accurate girls' advantage is that an episode is only 22 mins while this dragged on for 230 pages while reading it i thought of it as judy blume's forever meets that season of sex u0026amp the city when carrie dated another writer played by ron livingston i forget the character's name but that makes it sound a bit better than it was basically i have nothing in common with 30 year old literary brooklynites who are dealing with the dating scene so this book had zero that i could relate to","1371":"i liked this book i like that the author was female writing the thoughts of a male every idiot that i ever dated i could hear in some sense of this guy's thoughts and yet he wasn't a bad guy he just had thoughts about relationships that i'm sure most people do but still","1372":"incredibly well written and with its finger directly on the pulse of a certain class of young new york men and women calls out rampant male privilege as the disease that it is one that causes men to lead superficial lives of self congratulating false self reflection","1373":"i don't know if i'm too old and married too midwestern or too otherwise unsophisticated to really get this","1374":"i am 100% on board with this novel which is somehow both clever and earnest waldman is a goddamn genius at characterization--nate is exquisitely crafted of course i hate him--what woman wouldn't hate him --but he never becomes a parody of the kind of man waldman is subtly and deftly skewering there are moments i feel empathy for nate and his blockheaded psyche but mostly i thought \"god he's like name redacted and name redacted and-- well you get the picture this book has been read by everyone at this point but if you haven't picked it up yet i recommend it","1375":"i'm so torn between enjoying and despising this book while it contained some enjoyable observations and characterizations it was truly just a long winded exercise in literary masturbation","1376":"great writing the main character and his friends and girlfriends seem so real though it's depressing that he doesn't seem to get it that relationships are hard and take work serial monogamy isn't good for anyone","1377":" i really liked this book it is a smart book it is a mean book it is a sad book and it is a sweet book the book traces about a year in the life of nathaniel p a brooklyn writer whose first book is about to be published he's had a string of girlfriends but something changes when he meets hannah nathaniel starts to feel differently but the pull of his old self is hard to resist i liked this book because i thought it was realistic it doesn't end with everyone in love and happy it's more complicated than that which is like life it's really one of the best things i have read all year i urge you to pick it up and read it","1378":"i can't finish it i seriously dislike nathaniel p","1379":" maybes it's because i'm out of the dating game and a happily married gal maybe it's because i'm just sick to death of the detailed mind of 'brilliant young men or maybe it's because i just don't wish to know all of the mostly terrible thoughts that run through men's heads when they date women but if this is a look into the mind of a man then count me out i don't want to see it make no mistake adelle waldman is an incredible writer her sentence structure and style are remarkable and a modern twist on someone like dare i say heminway however she used her brilliant voice to create a shit character in nathaniel p he's egotistical selfish whiny entitled over educated or fancies himself so and thinks few women can hold a candle to his brilliant and interesting friends gross if i had been reading an actual book instead of a kindle i would have thrown said book across the room why do we need to keep perpetuating this kind of book and this kind of thought a melancholy academically inclined writer who can't find love because he keeps finding fault with the beautiful interesting women he dates do better","1380":" the more i think about this book the less i like it it's not the writing waldman has clearly represented her craft in numerous articles and essays and the prose here is realized and eloquent various references to ideas and literary influences abound it's the plot here waldman writes from the perspective of an unlikeable male protagonist one whose thoughts are derived not so much out of disdain but apathy here described is a modern relationship two people like each other well enough but something goes wrong what exactly we're not sure it's not your star crossed lovers tale or an epic story so much as the picture of a 'meh fuck you too' miscommunication that ends without losing much waldman provokes the ideas of what makes male serial daters misogynists and addresses several observations about dating and the contemporary man and woman but she never answers them and there's not enough here to start a real discussion trying to piece together any substantial thought about this i feel a bit like nate staring into his email apathetic there really is something odd about writers writing about borderline autobiographical writers too is this a specified genre yet","1381":"come on people get over your disdain for the protagonist and rate the writing here which is fantastic i cannot believe the author is female outstanding","1382":" i'm fairly sure that i've dated nate he is an asshole i'm also fairly sure that i've been hannah and aurit and elise and maybe even nate waldman's book really hits home on a lot of levels for those of us 30 somethings who have spent our young adulthoods in new york city but it's not necessarily flattering her characters are real and cringe worthy and that's part of the reason why i'm withholding the fifth star i'm always more impressed by writers who can write real characters who have warts and flaws but still make you like them with the love affairs of nathaniel p i didn't really respect any of the characters by the end of the book except maybe hannah i didn't hate them but i was ready to be done with them still very well written engaging and the lack of a real plot didn't bother me all that much because we had plenty of character arcs to make up for it","1383":"i feel about reading this book the way its protagonist felt upon reading an overly lengthy e mail from his ex he hadn't bee attentive to every sentence he wasn't able to be reading the e mail was so unpleasant that he found himself skimming he felt as if doing so were a courtesy to her as if he had caught her in an embarrassing posture ad were politely averting his eyes in my case her refers to the author","1384":" really a 3 5 the love affairs of nathaniel p is an engaging story about a particular relationship but it is equally as much a sociological study of the 21st century brooklyn millenial gen x milieu nathaniel the main character's predicament is that he can't be happy in relationships because he's afraid of intimacy and commitment and the compromises and effort required to maintain a relationship he finds himself in a promising relationship with hannah who's both pretty and a good intellectual match for him but ultimately destroys it by withdrawing refusing to discuss or work out issues and fixating on her every last minor flaw the best part of the book is how well waldman captures nathaniel's neuroses which are stereotypical yet painfully common in the real world the biggest issue i had with it is that while some of the brooklyn scene setting details are fun they eventually get old i e the fifth time you read some essentially filler conversation about so and so reading svevo or planning their next article for unnamed literary magazine it's not adding to the story anymore it might have worked better as a short ish story the ending was both cynical and totally believable","1385":"i thought it was great honest insightful about the mental emotional process of a man in a relationship","1386":"i was initially very excited about this book heard about it on npr brief description could probably be summed up as troubles and travails of hipster love in the brooklyn literary circle it was just nowhere near as good as i thought it would be the writing was really really great for the most part except when it was repetitive and that did happen in quite a few places but the main character was hateful every terrible part of yourself vis a vis relationships was embodied in this person every uncharitable thing you've ever thought about someone you were with main character's thought it on paper and he just goes on and on and on about how he doesn't like so many things about women but then proceeds to act like a high school girl throughout every party hookup and breakup he's not shallow definitely not nate p's issues are much much worse than being shallow so despite the great writing and despite the great backdrop of hipster literary brooklyn the main character made me dislike this book a lot and it kind of ruined hipster literary brooklyn for me maybe even brooklyn in general maybe that was part of adelle waldman's point","1387":"technically my rating is 3 5 stars this was an enjoyable read but i came into this knowing that the narrator was going to be a detestable piece of shit i was not wrong there were moments when i had to set the book down and just ugh at nate for a while also the book strikes me as a 2013 american remake of high fidelity i like the guy in high fidelity better","1388":"i don't believe that a protagonist has to be likable but there was simply nothing enjoyable about being in the head of a pretentious whiny jerk for 200 pages i wasn't amused or intrigued watching the steady decline and self sabotaging nature of his relationships just bored and apathetic","1389":" a copy of the love affairs of nathaniel p was provided to me by the publisher and netgalley for reviewing purposes review 3 5 starsi think it's safe to say that if you are an professional urbanite in your 20s 30s you've come across someone like nate at least once in your life living in nyc i've seen quite a few nate is the self proclaimed 'nice guy' he sees himself as a regular guy who prides himself on his circle of friends and his slightly above average intelligence he's bookish understanding real and perfectly happy with his life which is a cycle of sports bars book readings and important conversations nate is just your run of the mill guy and he can't for the life of him figure out why his relationships never work out the book follows nate and takes a look at the triumphs and disasters that are his love life i found the love affairs to be smart and extremely well written with where i currently am in my life i found the book to be real hitting the nail that is dating in a large city right on the head nate himself was frustrating and i battled a love hate relationship with his character i found him immature clueless and self absorbed which come on isn't much off from the real thing but there were moments when the things he said or thought were so spot on that i couldn't ignore the things we had in common my only complaint was that there were moments i found the book to be a little too wordy pages upon pages of inner narrative led me to become distracted there were moments i had read through entire pages without really remembering what i read at all all in all i do think it was a worthy read and waldman to be a wonderful new voice","1390":" this book review like all my other reviews can also be found on my wordpress blog bookshelves u0026amp paperbacks isn't the cover of this book one of the best covers you've ever seen or am i insane the only reason i bought this book was because the cover stood out elegant simple colorful i found myself wandering barnes u0026amp noble when i came across this and i didn't even read the synopsis before adding it to my 'to read' shelf on goodreads later i found the hardcover copy on book outlet for $3 and of course i had to buy it because that cover i'm afraid the cover is one of the only good things about this book perhaps it was own foolishness that i bought this book based solely on aesthetic rather than on the synopsis either way even if i had known the synopsis i would have been sorely disappointed because it wasn't the story or the plot that bothered me it was everything else i disliked all the characters the book encompassed a huge time line and the novel itself is around 250 pages long so it didn't do this large time line any justice and i felt like waldman was using her characters to comment on societal norms regarding gender and literature which bothered me plot the love affairs of nathaniel p follows nate piven a thirty something freelance writer living in brooklyn we encounter several of nate's ex girlfriends and the ones we do not actually get to see we are told about by the narrator from his crushes and reluctant relationships in high school to his disastrous relationship with a woman who he got pregnant waldman provides a portrait of piven through the course of several of these relationships until she zooms in on one relationship in particular nate meets hannah and they hit it off will nate's reluctance to commit and his problems with the opposite gender screw things up again or will he push through and make this work like i said before i had no problems with the story at all i enjoyed the premise of following one character through his various relationships seeing how he started and how he ended up i enjoyed reading about the women he dated i liked how waldman incorporated several different smaller love stories in one novel i did also like how waldman zoomed in on one relationship and followed the course of that relationship to offer us more insight into our protagonist's mind i thought that was a great idea however i did not think that the length of the novel did any of these storylines any justice if you're writing a book about the love affairs of a man i believe that some focus needs to be given on all of his important love affairs and even though some focus was provided it was largely fleeting and unsatisfactory some of the girls nate mentions are just there in the pages and don't actually do anything for the plot so it seemed filler i thought the relationships could have been much better fleshed out characters my main problem with the novel was the characterization all of the characters except perhaps hannah were completely asses and i despised them nate was a douche bag he was condescending and judgmental he had no idea what he wanted with life and in this dilemma of his he dragged other people down with him he had no respect for any of the women he dated he was pretentious and spent most of his time getting into debates about gender and capitalism and government that served no purpose in the novel itself but were just there to make the characters seem intelligent the only redeeming quality about nate was that at least he knew he was a dick that was about it though because even his awareness of his terrible soul bothered me because he didn't try to fix anything most of the other characters were treated like props nate has friends but they very rarely show up and when they do they're just as horrible as he is the girls who are out of his friend circle were apparently all empty brained women who wanted nothing but sex and of course despite nate being a terrible human being all the girls flocked to him like flies why i have no fucking idea and i don't think adelle waldman does either writing style adelle waldman has all the technique all of it she's a talented writer but she doesn't know how to construct a story sorry a little more showing a little less telling perhaps more work on pacing would be good perhaps writing a longer novel when there's a larger time line or condensing the time line to fit a smaller novel but then again this is a debut maybe i'm being too harsh overall this book had a lot of potential but it just fell flat","1391":"ugh nathaniel p is a douche","1392":"it's as if why men love bitches from doormat to dreamgirl a woman's guide to holding her own in a relationship was turned into a novel while i thought the writing was very good and the characterizations spot on the book left me feeling empty at the end we know these type of men exist waldman doesn't seem to want us to understand them better there's no satirical edge to the writing that might make it more enjoyable and yet i found myself continuing to turn the pages in appreciation of her insights into a particular sub species of narcissistic new yorker","1393":" this is the best book on american culture i've read by a novelist in a long long time it was not only intellectually stimulating psychologically penetrating and often very entertaining it was a page turner one that honored the characters articulated aspects of this rabble of citizens i needed to have articulated all in all a novel that i will be thinking about for as long as i've been craving it which has been a long fucking time it's her uses of irony that has stunned me the most i don't know if it's new or a 21st century form of it but i have yet to come across irony in this incarnation when americans say ironical we invariably have it confused for sarcastic and when we do understand the difference we destroy the instinct by using it like a branch of knowledge if irony isn't outwitting you you don't know what it is waldman is smarter than her better instincts as she is her feminist advocates she has written her male lead as a corrective to the usual male boast when our ego turns to erotic fictions but something odd happened along the way she decided to take her male lead at his word what resulted out of a desire to be fair is a kind of irony that the author herself might not even be aware of but more on that in a moment to begin with i loved the character hannah waldman has written her as well as her other leads in such a way that in retrospect it doesn't feel like i was reading fiction one of the first substantive conversations she has with the titular nate piven is about reading and its legitimacy there are people who read books and people who do not read books there are many people who believe there is a qualitative difference between the two the kind that believe that a better humanity exists among those who have read tolstoy and flaubert or for god's sakes the postmodernists i recall a round table that was broadcast on c span around the time of obama's election in 2008 which featured a group of novelists including colm toibin regarding the new president they all agreed well at least this one reads nate is sounding no different from these hannah actually arguing for democracy doesn't see the qualitative difference is it snobbery to think that lolita is better than a television show about pets nate persisted it's snobbery to think you're a better person than someone else just because they don't happen to get off on the world's most elegant account of child molestation now if i ever heard a woman say this on a date i'd ask for her hand in marriage instantaneously but then again we'd never get this far because i loathe nabokov it has been fascinating reading the negative reviews i wonder what these people have against children of immigrants in this case a romanian jew they must take it for granted that they were born into a life where they didn't have to fight for their cultural cues and capital waldman is no jhumpa lahiri she doesn't make a huge issue i e an entire career out of the immigrant experience in fact i chuckled that she dispatched with this whole trauma on nate's psyche in a mere two sentences nate had never thought of himself as disadvantaged his parents were immigrants but the kind with good jobs if lahiri was this sensible she wouldn't have anything to write about there is a kind of cruel streak to waldman's writing in the way orwell and houellebecq need to be cruel which is why i have warmed to her the women in nate's life are there as a greek chorus to his asshole ish lustful ways but what exactly does he desire like women everywhere they need to know exactly what this is in doing so they often look as hypocritical and self delusional as he while out with his friend aurit for instance she puts the iron maiden on him so that he can answer why he hasn't called hannah four days after two very successful dates hannah is catholic but she tells nate that's not the reason why she wishes to wait to have sex with him perfectly reasonable but now hannah now worries she may have blown a good opportunity he doesn't answer aurit for the sake of hannah understandably because when he finally gets around to an explanation a myriad of response passes through his head in the meantime aurit gives him a predictably accusatory you sound defensive i am thinking of conservative columnist ross douthat here and his book on what it's like going to harvard which nate did as a key to understanding the main character of this book douthat's observation applies the one that says those that attend elite institutions resist commitment and sexual commitments generally on account of dedication to their careers which must take precedent over true love which will only derail you from the night and day hours needed to set you apart you must be ruthless with your time to attain a goal of a prestigious job it should never be forgotten while reading this book that nate being an asshole if you want to be vulgar about it is only partly attributable to his maleness the rest is that he has just received a six figure advance on the book he has written it's perfectly understandable that he's hesitant about committing to women who suddenly find him attractive that's what makes hannah interesting she puts off sex knowing what everyone else knows that he's now a commodity but what wonderful women friends nate has like freud aurit had a coherent theory of the universe the one that states you know that single men are lacking in emotional well being classic aurit take whatever she was personally interested in and apply all her ingenuity to turning it into something important it never occurred to her that there was anything more worth caring about or thinking about than upper middle class women's search for happiness in the cozily coupled fatally bourgeois sense of the word she thought if she could convey how much this meant to women articulate it once and for all the world would come around never did she realize how limited her perspective was how insensible she was to all that fell outside the sphere of her own preoccupations the exact kind of woman who would find nate an asshole meanwhile aurit and the waitress have an instinctive dislike of one another who asks aurit if she's done with her food uh no then this the waitress scowled and walked away aurit's nostrils flared bad service was a source of great frustration for her an irritant that might at any moment set her off like science was for the medieval church this is how waldman's irony works aurit is telling nate not to be such an asshole toward women while saying this her contempt for another woman one struggling at a waitress job is instantly obvious to the waitress it's amazing we americans do not realize the extent to what walking parodies we are when she comes back i'm going to tell her there was too much arugula on my pizza says aurit you're being an asshole nate for expecting things to be just right now someone bring me the right amount of arugula another big theme a blowjob didn't quite work out and hannah asks nate if there's something she should be doing differently waldman has nate fret about having to explain what he really wants his discomfort discussing this for having to become a different person in order to get what he sexually wants this discomfort is actually the normal reaction everyone's fear that they might be lousy in bed is irrational if there is a mutual attraction and for the right reasons there's nothing to worry about nothing to explain no one technically can be called lousy in bed though there are many who have a knack for choosing the wrong person it helps to know what exactly turns you on on instinct and not on explanation that someone might be lousy in bed is just the single person's lament for continuing to be that way and the married person's one for not understanding the true nature of marriage that waldman is so psychologically astute about this to combine this with her understanding of class distinctions and the nature of ambition is what makes this novel so compelling i loved it and cannot wait to see what she does next","1394":"a friend passed this on to me and i thought it would be a light read but i discovered it has some interesting insights into the dating relationship scene","1395":" yes nate p is a d ck but his character was quite believable as i went to college with about 1000 of these guys those who trade on a banal achievement like going to harvard for far too long and think that it gives them license to treat others as inferior especially women who obviously wronged them by choosing not to date them in high school despite the accurate portrayal it was still hard to read though like having to tap into a really bad memory and also this book got bogged down by the pseudo intellectualism prose sometimes it felt like the author wasn't critiquing nate's world as much as admiring it probably would have given it 2 stars except the line about persevering by not going to law school was so amazingly encapsulating of this generation social set that it was worth another star","1396":" despite my continuous irritation with the book's subject and his somewhat callous tendencies i felt a slight endearment for him it was like reading about a foolish friend who always seems lost and rudderless the first few chapters were hard to get through reference aforementioned irritation but i soon found myself flying through the misadventures of nate's life with enthusiasm and curiosity about what predicament he would land in next kudos to adelle waldman for keeping me fascinated by this character i had a love hate relationship with from page 1 to the end","1397":"i love the single mindedness of this novel the respect it pays to the claustrophobic ego of its protagonist and of brooklyn itself i also like the readability of the prose and the ease by which the author delivers her many insights","1398":"really fun read especially for any brooklynite who has ever dated in nyc","1399":"is this really how today's eligible bachelors think if so then i am in deep trouble if the author has indeed captured the thought processes and motivations of the average educated urban male well then kudos to her","1400":" my rating is more of a 2 5 stars the writing is pretty solid but nate annoyed the hell out of me halfway through the book i wanted to stop reading the way he over analyzed everything drove me to skim a lot of his inner thoughts passages he and most of his friends basically supported the idea that intellectual educated 30 something men who live in brooklyn and write for a living only want to date petite squeaky voiced emotionally all over the place women other women for all their attractiveness wit and writing talent couldn't last long in the face of nate's own self absorbed thoughts and insecurities and even when he dates these bubbly cheerleader types he still can't completely get over himself enough to be content in life or with his friends and romantic partners","1401":"this book rang so true in its terrible relationshipy moral and emotional ambiguity it made me extremely grateful for my husband dating is extremely confusing and stressful i liked how the book was peppered with some intellectual debates as well to step away a bit from the love drama it's kind of weird to read a story from the perspective of a slightly misogynistic guy written by a woman it was a little disorienting at first but i think she nailed a specific kind of man","1402":"this story made no sense to me i couldn't relate to nathaniel or any of the women in the story is this a story that twenty somethings would have a better time relating to i did like the writing but not the characters or the story","1403":"\"but his relationship with elisa would be difficult to explain \" page 136 this quote adequately describes the love affairs of nathaniel p as it is a very strange book which at times i question if it knows what it wants to be while it at many a time is very interesting and quite thought provoking nate piven is a young man with plenty of his life ahead of him and is trying to find the meaning of love and the love of his life na 50 shades of nathaniel p and his cavalcade of minor characters t\"but his relationship with elisa would be difficult to explain \" page 136 this quote adequately describes the love affairs of

with plenty of his life ahead of him and is trying to find the meaning of love and the love of his life nate seems to go through girls about as fast a stock car zooms around the track we fall nate and his myriad of friends who have an amalgamation of ideas and attitudes a lot of his book is hard to read because some of the characters are hard to relate too and come off as having an ivory tower elitist attitude towards life but it tends to deliver some relatable points and some engaging discussion topics tthe books tries to at times be two much of everything it appears to be a social attack on how our society views love and relationships this tends to be its main objective however it also tends to try to be comedic some of that is lost on me it provides a strange but short sided view on men and their relationships through the eyes of a female as well i do not know if the adelle waldman wants nate to be relatable the average joe if that is true i think waldman is way off base on portraying the average guy in this late 20s early 30s at times it also feels that waldman wants nate to be a creepy at times sexist nate tends to says he feels for other people's thoughts and feelings but wants to try to change the women he falls for as well nate wants to find love but is way to nitpicky when we is dating a girl tall in all it is hard to think something like this exists it is a decent and quite interesting book but also can easily turn off a reader i would really recommended this book but there certainly is an audience for nate and his adventures but unless you want to read a very strange book or this book appears to be up your ally i would say avoid it and if small minute details really irk you and frustrate you indeed you should avoid this book like the preferable plague as for me i feel the best answer is to give the single most average rating i can a 3 5 for me it was intriguing at points but their were points where i feel that had no point to be on the page and parts that were a complete snooze fest","1404":" the love affairs of nathaniel p is a sort of slight read but it is also exactly what it purports to be an absorbing tale of one young man's search for happiness--and an inside look at how he really thinks about women sex and love i found it enthralling in a similar way to the cable show girls sort of more than you want to know about self absorbed twenty somethings and yet this is full of humor and male insight it paints a sometimes surprisingly unlovely picture of young women and yet it is nate's point of view and his is a believable landscape of women dating and romance among people with little experience and less self awareness nate piven is a likable guy who usually tries to do the right thing although his experience hormones and neuroses buffet him like a little ship on the sea from one woman to another overall i found this an utterly captivating light read","1405":"what a great tale of neurotic new yorkers","1406":"meh it's a book about a pretentious white writer living in brooklyn who likes to have casual sex until he gets in steady relationships and gets flippant and bored there were certainly entertaining parts but it's easy to get bogged down in the language the author uses to get her point across that her main character is a harvard grad and likes to have intelligent conversations with his fellow ivy league pals there comes a point in the book after you've picked up your dictionary one too many times that you start thinking who's the pretentious one here the author or the main character i'd say pass on this one it just didn't grab me as other books of similar content have and the main character is just a douche and not a lovable one either","1407":" did not finish the protagonist had no redeeming qualities and even the self conscious parts of myself that i saw in him were colored with resentment desired effect of the author or no stars for the quality of the writing itself which i enjoyed i only got about a third in i believe that the story is not meant to flatter nathaniel but in the honesty and mockery of him i felt a sense of despair towards those guys and this generation and questions of whether i'm out of touch with people my own age came up and so on and blah blah i left my copy in the laundry room of my building and someone took it so i've been de burdened","1408":"this was pretty much just the final third of high fidelity transplanted from london music circles to brooklyn literary ones minus everything that's awesome about nick hornby","1409":" while i was reading this book i asked myself a question that i read somewhere why has this book received so much acclaim and why has it done so when so many books on similar subjects the romantic misadventures of new yorkers are derided as chick lit could it be just because the author has a literary pedigree or just because the narrator is male i was prepared to answer that last question in the affirmative and to dismiss the book as an undeserving darling of the critical press i was pleasantly surprised this book is actually very good not 5 stars turn your world over good but worth reading easily worth staying up late to finish worth gifting to a friend it's good first and foremost because it's enjoyable this is always my first criteria for fiction while i was reading it i wanted to be reading it and while i wasn't reading it i often wanted to be reading it as well it was also interesting in a literary sense not because the characters are all angsty brooklyn literary types but because the author is female and the narrator is male yeah sure obvious but also somewhat rare and interesting to see waldman draws her narrator so dead on brings us so close to his thoughts and their skittish improximity to his feelings that i had to keep reminding myself that this was not a man it was what a woman thought of a man a woman who'd probably read a lot of early nick hornby the narrator is highly self conscious unappealing in person but interesting in a book especially in contrast to the endlessly naive female protagonists of many women's books about love who meet the guy they're going to end up with on page 5 break up with their boyfriend on page 250 get together with the first guy on page 260 and ride off into the sunset on page 265 this narrator is actually smart if life if not about himself and he makes the kind of mistakes real people make the writing is smart and incisive and observant mostly about things like cocktail parties of people who have spent too much time in grad school but smart writing is smart writing like in life there are spoiler no happy endings here at the end of the book some things are better than at the beginning and some things are worse nothing though has fundamentally changed and while this is not necessarily a strength in itself it frees the author from the machinations of a plot with a goal her characters don't need to find their soulmates or outgrow their neuroses and like real people in the course of a few months most of them don't but the ride the book takes us on is more interesting than most of the predictable epiphanies of comfort fiction and only threatening if you're a man or a woman or if you live in brooklyn","1410":" this was a quick and enjoyable read and i dithered between three and four stars ideally i'd give it three and a half the novel takes place within a hermetically sealed world that of contemporary literary brooklyn and the twenty and thirty somethings who posture and philosophize and eat eggs benedict within it having had some brushes with this world i found waldman's portrayal of it convincing and her imaginative entry into the brain of a certain type of bookish narcissistic young man was from what i could tell spot on a thirty ish novelist who has just inked a deal for his first book the eponymous nathaniel p is an up and comer in the highly stratified new york literary scene for him and his friends the perfect woman is not only red hot but has read the entire works of italo svevo and can hold her own in a discourse about the commodification of conscience sensitive and smart on the page nate can be a bit of a dick when it comes to personal relationships nevertheless he dates a succession of attractive and talented women most of whom he ends up treating badly though i sensed that waldman might have a bit of an axe to grind here herself being the type of smart literary woman a guy like nate would dump she isn't just out to skewer nate and his ilk nate is a pretty complex character capable of great tenderness often given to wondering why he acts like such a cad and i'm sure many male readers will feel great sympathy for him what i found most skillful here was waldman's tracking of the power dynamics and minute emotional shifts that can happen during the course of an interaction between two people to me that was what lifted the novel a notch above what it might have otherwise been funny highbrow literary gossip","1411":" when i first heard about this book i was not interested in picking it up i thought it would be a celebration of the casual snobbery that passes for hipness among young urbanites replete with obscure cultural references and modernist self awareness but i was sucked in by the comedy of manners label and comparisons to jane austen so i had a what the hell moment at the bookstore and bought it at that point i think i still expected to hate read it to my surprise i became not only totally absorbed by the characters but sympathetic to many of them after the first few pages i could not put it down as becomes painfully obvious from the first scene running into the girl he accidentally knocked up nate is easy to hate but what makes him and all of the other characters in the book so engaging is that they are real ms waldman has managed to create a brooklyn full of self absorbed spirited callous generous messed up and sometimes insightful people we have all made their same mistakes been similarly unkind and scrambled to make up for it waldman writes so sensitively and humanely that even nate douchebag extraordinaire tugs your heart strings now and again the end of the story was both touching and difficult to bear but again it was an ending that was real and undressed up and consequently heartfelt i've read reviews that say this book speaks to those who have lived in new york and hung out in gentrifying neighborhoods and gone to parties with 20 something aspiring intellectuals but it speaks to a much wider audience than that certainly a young one but also to anyone who has been young and made stupid decisions for unknown reasons and treated others badly and felt the sting of regret","1412":"this often felt less like a novel than a dissertation on modern dating it was frighteningly accurate but not altogether enjoyable","1413":"men are the worst cross examiners of themselves","1414":" the love affairs of nathaniel p is a case study of a thirty something brooklynite writer in the throes of dating despite the fact that nate is a \"product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education \" he's still overwhelmingly flawed the book chronicles a series of his relationships revealing that nate as a selfish shallow guy who just isn't that in to her or her or her or her what makes the case study interesting is nate who is as self aware as he is clueless it's a strange combination a \"cocktail of guilt and pity and dread \" this isn't a plot driven novel but the cringe worthy dialogue and the raw relationship scenes will leave you wondering whether you've ever dated nate or whether maybe possibly you've ever been nate it isn't comfortable or even fun to read but it is a savvy observation of human nature three and a half stars favorite quotes at home he'd read kristen bits from proust and she'd get this pinched look on her face as if the sheer extravagance of proust's prose was morally objectionable as if there were children in africa who could have better used those excess words and treading on weakness is exactly what dating felt like with so many of these women--with their wide open hopefulness their hunger for connection and blithe assumption that men wanted it just as badly based on what on whom dating is probably the most fraught human interaction there is you're sizing people up to see if they're worth your time and attention and they're doing the same to you it's meritocracy applied to personal life but there's no accountability we submit ourselves to these intimate inspections and simultaneously inflict them on others and try to keep our psyches intact--to keep from becoming cold and callous--and we hope that at the end of it we wind up happier than our grandparents who didn't spend this vast period of our their lives these prime years so thoroughly alone coldly and explicitly anatomized again and again but the same women who are so quick to call men immature when they don't order their lives around snug domestic relationships would never call a woman immature because she doesn't want to pop out babies they resent the hell out of anyone who implies there's anything wrong with her choice no women only pull out that talk about mature adulthood when it's convenient when they want grounds to resent some poor guy who doesn't want what they want it isn't merely inconsistent it suggests an unwillingness to take seriously another person's preferences as such it's a tyrannical impulse and somebody really needs to say so when you're single your weekend days are wide open vistas that extend in every direction in a relationship they're like the sky over manhattan punctured hemmed in compressed he felt bad for noticing and worse for being a little repelled and yet he was transfixed the distaste he felt in its crystalline purity was perversely pleasurable","1415":"i didn't get the hype with this book it just sounded like a bunch of self involved brooklynites with too much time on their hands","1416":"waffling between four and five stars 4 5","1417":"the love affairs of nathaniel p was clever and well written but i had a lot of trouble summoning much sympathy for the protagonist i was genuinely surprised when i realized that the author is a woman either she's got men exactly right or she's got men the way i see them exactly right","1418":"it's not even that i was overly engaged with nate piven's self absorbed literary rising star it's just that adelle waldman's writing is just so darn good i wasn't particularly rooting for nate with his taxonomy of homo erectus brooklynitis but merely engrossed in her ability to tell a story i listened to this book on audio and the narration was outstanding as well i really enjoyed this book and it's hard to believe this is the author's first novel","1419":" at a mere 243 pages \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" is a quick sufficiently engaging exploration of the modern day new york relationship scene unfortunately all of the ground in this book has already been covered more subtly and smartly by lena dunham in hbo's 'girls ' also unfortunately the element of autobiography is so thinly veiled that it takes you out of the story and makes you constantly cognizant of the author's imprint on book i have less of a problem with this book specifically than i have a problem with it in general now i'm all about writing what you know but this is the kind of book that comes across as being 80% autobiography 10% clever quips that she overheard guys telling her at a party 5% novelized regurgitations of her previous tweets and 5% fiction the least surprising sentences in the book were the first and last sentences in the about the author section \"adelle waldman is a freelance journalist and book reviewer \" \"she lives in brooklyn \" huh just like nate i get a little bit of fatigue of the navel gazing of faux struggling writers and the seeming inability to distinguish the difference between the clever observations of everyday life and profound insight portions of this book are very relatable however my perspective on fiction is that it should take you to a place you couldn't otherwise go but offers you a pathway to figure out how the story intertwines with your version of the human condition this book instead reads like a novel length edition of the \"modern love\" column in the ny times and in my opinion would have benefitted from the removal of the veneer of fiction given how aware i was of the author while reading the book i may have been oversensitive to the unrealistic depiction of men as a group the male characters are almost uniformly a strange combination of ivy league entitlement overeducation and conversational familiarity with philosophical theories yet with an aftertaste of alpha male douchebag all rolled into one the thing is that particular strain of man is more a figment of one's imagination than somebody that exists in real life as the book wore on nate in particular became more dislikable and more difficult to relate to and empathize with in his relationship with hannah i think that the de evolution of nate may have been intentional on the author's part but if such was the case i didn't clearly understand the larger point she was making with the exercise one theme that was well developed is the trade off you inherently make when entering a relationship exchanging loneliness for over familiarity however i think this angle could have been more interestingly examined if hannah wasn't such a flawless individual we never see nate reacting poorly to hannah's missteps instead we see nate reacting irrationally to hannah's intellect generosity and kindness i think the attempt here is to get into the head of \"the guy who is all interested in a woman until the very moment when it dawns on him that he has her \" but that perspective is incongruent with the character of nate that was built up over the course of the book additionally the lack of clarity as to the reason why the nate hannah relationship deteriorated made the final quarter of the book all the more confusing basically the book's conclusion implies that the resolution to being in a relationship with a great woman that you become bored frustrated hypercritical of is to find a woman who is hot and that you're intellectually superior to and you'll magically not have those bored frustrated hypercritical feelings anymore i didn't make the leap with her this is a book that's ultimately about relationships but wants to take itself more seriously than that to deleterious effect at one point nate muses that \"elisa was a beautiful intelligent woman trying desperately to make herself into a slightly different kind of intelligent woman \" i'd argue that this book is an intelligent perspective desperately trying to make itself into a slightly different kind of intelligent perspective which eventually suffers on account of the extra effort","1420":"book recommendation this book","1421":"a smart and intricately drawn portrait of an unremarkable protagonist a straight young white man in brooklyn who has found the literary success he was always sure he deserved and the subsequent attention of women that validates the years of being the nice guy he clocked prior to success while i don't have a connection to the publishing world and didn't care about many of those details the hierarchies of articles and contracts and titles etc the characters were very familiar especially i would guess if you went to a liberal arts college on the east coast waldman is clearly talented and observant and the book was a quickly engrossing read but i can't say i found it enjoyable i spent the majority of the book either tortured by the protagonists infuriating opinions and successes or tortured by my own recollections at having behaved like both he and the victims of his emotional idiocy not sorry i read it but not sorry to be out of nathaniel p's world","1422":"nathaniel p is a basic bitch","1423":"i picked up this book after reading the author's recent essay in the new yorker about female beauty in literature when i made the connection that adelle waldman was the author of the love affairs of nathaniel p which i had read some buzz about i was sold this book had been aptly described as a modern comedy of manners occupied by up and coming writers in brooklyn's literary scene this book was a quick read and for the most part i found it to be sharp wry and enjoyable there were times when the writing was a bit verbose but it felt right for these characters to write speak and think in that manner","1424":"considering this is a contemporary novel about white americans my age this is about as far from my experience as it gets i found the main character despicable overall but waldman does a fantastic job of making me understand the motivation and internal conflicts nate experiences i read primarily to better understand other people and this book satisfies that also it makes me glad to be happily married","1425":"couldn't put it down living in new york now it was interesting to see the places that she describes and people watch i think waldman did really well with writing the story from a male's perspective although when i talked about it to my husband he said that some of the stuff nathaniel was written to think was not what most guys would think about that said he's just one guy so who knows if that's true or not but anyhow it's a good read and really well written so i give it 4 stars","1426":"i wasn't overly fond of this novel for a few reasons but the most of which is that the main character possibly the author seems to be overly pretentious nothing seems to really please him as he finds fault in everything it didn't put me in a very good mood when i put the book down i didn't feel any connection to the characters either as they all seemed to be unrealistic static i will confess that i actually didn't finish the book because it got to the point where i no longer respected the main character","1427":"this is a hard book to get through it's just page after page of nate tearing women apart for not being what he wants them to be love affairs is really about a self involved man child who thinks he was guaranteed a super model pouts when he doesn't get it and can't deal when women actually turn out to be human and it's not like i haven't rooted for my share of jerks in entertainment but i just can't find anything to like about nate or this story","1428":" read this and other reviews at ampersand readthis is what happens in nathaniel p our acerbic narrator nate dates a girl for a few months and has many quibbling and tiresome academic fights with friends he doesn't seem to like very much that's it you think maybe you'll go back in time to revisit his past relationships go over how he met them what he learned from each girl but apart from the occasional afternoon musing about an ex you don't get to really hear about anybody but nate and nate is jerk something more than a jerk but i'm censoring it for goodreads a really boring jerk i literally like every single other character better than nate and a lot of the other characters suck let's go back up to that synopsis briefly nate is supposedly a sensitive modern man which is completely untrue he's not sensitive in the least he disparages all women in his life painfully agonizes over mundane archaic things about dating women relationships none of which is new even worse is the thought that this book reveals one particular though also alarmingly familiar young man's thoughts about women and love which is technically true only because it will be familiar to any woman who has ever dated a womanizing prick why is all this lauded as positive without reading the book it might sound promising after reading love affairs it just points out what a terrible person and character nate is so nate spends 70% of the book trying to make his whinings about dating and relationships seem valid and worthwhile the other 30% of the book is nate interacting with friends at various restaurants or parties and always getting into random arguments about random philosophical psychological political topics they may or may not write articles about to sell for freelance gigs such as the export of labor as the height of capitalism or obesity or book reviews and seeing as there's no reason for me to care about these arguments no common ground is struck no argument is returned to or becomes a major plot point and no one is ever in any danger of losing a gig or even suffering for money for some reason probably because they all seem to have written a book for a huge advance the plots and characters of which are treated as unimportant inconsequential there's nothing for me to care about here no actively stimulating plot no stakes nate is a sexist boring jerk who thinks he is someone important women tend to like him who knows why but he's bad at dating he's selfish and apart from his jerk ness doesn't have anything interesting going for him i don't care is he gets a happy ending or even an unhappy ending i would not recommend nate or his boring boorish story","1429":"not uplifting but very enjoyable like if an edith wharton or jane austen type was evaluating a philip roth or paul auster satisfying in that way","1430":"for anyone whohas had feelings yes we're allneurotic messes","1431":" i would have given the book more stars if it hadn't been so uncomfortable a very good discourse on the disparity between what we think and what we actually do or say in relationships and the resulting consequences while i found myself being disgusted with nate the discomfort came from the fact that i found him so relatable his petty inner thoughts were starkly displayed that being said the writing was wonderful even if i can't bring myself to say i liked the book i felt as if these were real people rather than characters it also provided good fodder for book club discussion","1432":"teton county library call no f waldmanmarisa's rating 4 starsfirst i don't know if i would call this the love affairs of nathaniel p the book mostly centers around the main character nate and his relationship with the smart interesting and modern hannah the narrator goes into nate's brain often mostly while he's messing around in his apartment attempting to read write reviews eat and tells the reader of his romantic past nate was not always popular with women but he is smart and has learned how to look at women with a critical and fascinated eye nate's relationship with hannah feels so contemporary and real they are intellectual equals and yet things end up devolving for confusing and murky reasons i actually appreciated waldman's ending speaking to the impreciseness of relationships and love she gave nate a love interest who is not expected i would recommend this to anyone interested in the brooklyn literary scene and the hipster culture within intellectuals in new york","1433":" nate is a bit of a jerk but he doesn't really understand what he's doing wrong make no mistake though he's not really a lovable jerk the story is primarily about his latest relationship with hannah but there are many flashbacks to previous relationships i think the author does an excellent job of getting into the brain of a specific type of guy the liberal arts educated articulate city dwelling publishing industry type it's just a little too inside baseball and new york hipster for me","1434":"this is a quick light read and i enjoyed it as that the characters are well observed in that the author provides compelling and revealing details that are very relatable but ultimately the lead character didn't really ring true to me and so the interactions he had with women didn't really ring true to me either it seemed really obvious that his character was written by a woman imagining what a man would care about or notice in the women he dates as opposed to what men actually notice but maybe i've just never known a nathaniel p","1435":"i absolutely loved this book though i'm not sure i can read it again parts of it are too cringeworthy and painful it captures what it means all too well to be a well meaning self absorbed male writer in brooklyn the author does a great job of getting inside nathaniel's head and all the ways that he deceives himself no easy feat strangely it made me homesick for my time in brooklyn and yet i don't miss dating jerks like this at all perfectly likable jerks but jerks all the same","1436":" ugh this book was well marketed so when i walked into the library and saw the new books display i immediately recognized it and picked it up this was definitely not worth my time and i realized that within the first few pages however i continued to skim the book because i never or very rarely abandon a book this was a chick lit relationship book from the viewpoint of a man but written by a woman much much too crass for me and way way too analytical not much action too much analysis","1437":"nathaniel \"nate\" piven is a writer on the rise in brooklyn he has worked hard and lived lean in order to achieve his current success with a book that will soon be published nate is missing one thing in his life a meaningful relationship with a woman as he dates and breaks up with several women readers come to understand nate's problem he is a jerk this guy thinks that he is so smart and so wonderful and of course he is not it is of little surprise to anyone that he is still single he knows nothing about women sex and love while i did not hate this novel i really did dislike nate and all of his girlfriends these folks are totally hate able on the other hand i couldn't wait to see who nate would date next go figure","1438":" out of all of the interesting and complex people that make up this world let's narrow in on a few who are actually trite and boring but think they're hot shit a few writers in brooklyn who claim to hate gentrification but only eat free range quinoa chicken in upscale rooftop bars their biggest problems include being afraid of looking too privileged because they went to harvard feeling beleaguered by the peasants who didn't go to harvard and feeling slightly guilty when they hire mexican women to clean their bathrooms but only slightly because they couldn't possibly do it themselves and while we're there in this little bubble of liberal guilt and armchair philosophizing let's focus in on the most boring and most obnoxious of all nate p nate has even bigger problems than all his little friends he went to harvard but he has to hide his embarrassing immigrant parents and middle class background because he knows his so called friends are just snobby enough to judge him for it he also has this thing with women namely he treats them like shit and then feels bewildered and like there must be something fundamentally wrong with me woe is me i'll never love again when things don't work out yeah there is something wrong with you you're a jerk and that's the whole book he starts out an oblivious jerk and ends up a jerk who's slightly more aware of his jerkiness but decides to do nothing about it which makes him a bigger jerk do not recommend","1439":" this book examines the relationships dating habits social shortcomings and a myriad of other subtle life issues through the mind of nathanial p while he is semi successfully involved in romantic relationships nate and his friends live in a newly gentrified brooklyn and all seem to be writers and literary critics who are beginning to gain a level of success in their careers the author uses nate's voice to examine a women's take on how a man who believes he is liberated perceives the development of sexual attraction relationships fidelity and partnership i found it both thoughtful thought provoking and entertaining","1440":"five stars for the incredible descriptions of relationships personalities and inner dialogue two stars because i can't stand nate and feel for all of the girls","1441":"it's weird because the characters in here remind me quite a bit of the characters in the showtime series the affair maybe that just goes to the universality of this kind of topic i liked this book i didn't love it hannah is way too saintly despite what our narrator keeps telling us and nate does some things that don't quite click for me as realistic but an interesting book nonetheless","1442":"not much interesting about these characters or their relationships with one another 240 pages to communicate that bk based writers are self involved both men and women save the time and go for a tour of coffee shops the characters will be much more real there and much more entertaining","1443":"what happened in the last chapter guys what happened i think i'm tiring of the 21st century novel of manners in nyc thing but the book seemed accurate about straight relationships happening currently with people in their late 20s i am ambivalent about the last chapter","1444":"i abandoned it less than half way through found it boring didn't engage with or care about the characters i almost never stop reading a book without finishing but this really felt like a waste of my time","1445":"amazing character sketch too realistic","1446":"the insights were interesting at times however it was quite hard to sympathize with the narrator and all together i am not sure what the point of the book was at least it wasn't longer","1447":"the amount of time i have had to read lately has been extremely limited but while i was in new york last month i made a trip to strand check out everything i got here and the love affairs of nathaniel p was on the bestsellers table with a great price i've heard about this book quite a bit and it's a national bestseller so i decided to go for it it's a thin book but it's packed with a lot more story than you would think the first thing i noticed was how intelligent the author must be the characters are without exception extremely complex and intellectual almost all of them are aspiring writers living in brooklyn the whole story follows the dating patterns of the main character nate to be completely honest i kind of hated him but the insights into the male mind as written by a female author were really intriguing waldman does a great job at picking on both sexes - no one is safe in this book she did a great job picking out things women in relationships do that drive me crazy like sending angry emails post breakup but then on the flip side she really digs in on how terribly nate treats his girlfriend whether it's getting annoyed with her for wanting to cook him breakfast or fixating on her under arm jiggle overall my dislike for nate won out he seemed like one of those people you encounter in college who knows he's intelligent and won't let you forget it he was self loathing and conceited and i didn't always follow his thought process and got frustrated with his bad decisions however i think that was a main reason why waldman wrote from nate's perspective it was an extremely effective way to show the disconnect between the way men and women view relationships solve problems and deal with heartbreak and rejection i must say that i really liked aurit nate's friend she seemed to be the wise character who kept the book grounded with her reason overall i enjoyed this book the writing was very well done and intelligent fluffy is definitely not a word you can use to describe this book i don't often read books with male main characters but i am really glad i bought this one it examines relationships in a very different way which was refreshing i was happy that there wasn't really a happily ever after it's more realistic and a nice change to the formulaic hollywood romance http www magnoliasandsunlight com 2","1448":" felt true in the big ways and false in the small ways as a character study of how thoughtful moral post feminist men can still be assholes it's terrific as a record of how a certain kind of mid length relationship can sour it's almost uncomfortably insightful but it's marred by the fact that nobody talks the way the characters in this book talk they feel human when they're acting but they're hyper articulate marionettes when they're talking the ending too feels desired rather than earned a glued on moral that isn't bought through plot","1449":"strong masculine narrative voice although the feminine penetrates in places emotions sentiments beautifully written and capturing the essence of apathy in the modern age at its heart the novel is about hannah as told through nate and his relationship with her and with other women it is about who she isn't as much as who she is 'as a rule men want a reason to end a relationship while women want a reason to keep it going' 'men and women on relationships are like men and women on orgasms except in reverse ' jason continued boisterously 'women crave relationships the way way men crave orgasm their whole being bends to its imperative men in contrast want relationships the way women want orgasm sometimes under the right circumstances ' 214","1450":"i might be momentarily biased because i just dated nate for the last three months in a sense this book was like reliving a nightmare but did offer a tad bit of validation from the female perspective well done","1451":"liked it didn't love it i found it to be impressively truthful maybe it felt like a lot of people i know but i had a hard time really caring bc the world felt really small","1452":"don't bother","1453":" i was disgusted with nate the entire way through this book he is shallow judgmental and hypocritical of the women he dates when he dates a woman of his equal intelligence he finds ways to undermine the relationship that would take work to maintain he acknowledges faults with the woman he chooses to stay with but stays with her because it is the relationship where he can be himself no improvement necessary is this what a modern relationship is the one where you are comfortable not the one that challenges you to be a better person","1454":"i wondered when i read this book do i hate this guy or am i this guy by this i mean that he is often so arrogant and condescending to women but other times so relatable that i started to wonder about myself the book was a quick read but i expect to think about it for a long time","1455":"i started really disliking this book but by the end i was won over nathaniel p represents a modern young man in new york a person who really does exist we have all encountered him that guy who talks the talk of a liberal thinking feminist ally but his actions underline a deep misogyny waldman hits it on the head pretty hard my only complaint is that the other characters besides nate and hannah who are our leads are pretty thin and one dimensional also these are supposed to be people who populate a smart literary crowd but they all seem pretty dumb i wish there was as much subtext in this book as there is in all the novels that are referenced it's pretty on the nose about the point it is trying to make which i didn't enjoy at times i did end up enjoying it in the end would recommend just out of curiosity to see what people think of it","1456":"when the newness wears off a relationship bored nate an up and coming writer uses neglect and disinterest as sabotage","1457":"a sharp character study of an unsympathetic young intellectual in nyc and his circle of friends and romantic partners while the conversations and rumination amongst these literary types sometimes borders on soporific there is also plenty of dry wit and painful truths","1458":"waldman's debut novel is an excellent skewering of a very particular kind of man the modern sensitive literary intellectual man the one who is above the petty concerns of everyday life and cares only about ideas this man of course is a douche bag i don't say this lightly for a couple of the chapters covering nate's youth and college years remind me in a few ways of myself a son of immigrants at an ivy league school with the typical adolescent drives and no clear idea what to do with all of that - well that hits home i like to think that i turned out different from nate p who eventually ends up in brooklyn determined to be a writer in his role as an aspiring writer bordering on success nate embodies a lot of things i truly hate superiority arrogance condescension each covering some deep insecurities waldman nails some of the thought processes of men like that compulsions to pursue women a need for conquest and immediate panic when things progress beyond that stage the women he meets are maddening in their own ways the worst of which is their low self esteem several times you'll want to shake one of them and tell her to get it together and go talk to normal people alas these men and women in some sense deserve each other except that nobody deserves nate the politics and philosophy discussed at parties provide a fun backdrop to the sort of people you're dealing with here nate and people like him are in some sense torn by their own liberal ideology and political correctness sure it's important to improve the lot of the poor but it's also really nice to get rich and famous of course men and women are equal though it's hard to pretend that they're not very different in their natures there is a big space between what nate and his friends tell themselves everyone should care about and what they actually care about unlike me they beat themselves up over it nate's views on women aren't inaccurate but they're hateful because women are different from him but should be the same they're wrong and somehow lesser only late does waldman let us know that she realizes that men and women don't need to be the same it's subtle and i wonder how many pick up on it the book is a very quick read with efficient prose there is a lot of telling rather than showing though it's not until the last couple of chapters that this becomes a problem i found the wrap up too rushed with a lot of exposition worth a read if you're familiar with these kinds of people","1459":"there is something so engrossing about the antics of this protagonist i can't stand yet him yet see glimmers of so many characters i love in real life and just when i empathize with him i fear i am as unconscious of my own failings as he is his waldman masterfully captures the spirit and hypocrisies of my generation's male heroes","1460":"thank you to toni for this lovely hostess gift it needed to be read for sure i probably need to recommend this to at least half a dozen people including at least one ex boyfriend because they will find the story of a 30 year old harvard graduate and literary success story navigating his relationships with women to be oh so relatable in one way or another which makes me want to roll my eyes and throw the book across the room but i liked the book and found it totally engrossing so in spite of being about an insufferably intellectual and self pitying man child whom women seemingly can't resist the book was written by a woman it reminds me of when wally lamb channeled troubled womanhood in she's come undone and i kept having to double check that it was really written by a man because it's fun to speculate i can't help but wonder whether the author had some version of a relationship that looked like nate and hannah's although it's told from nate's point of view it seems pretty insightful about how the relationship must have felt for hannah there is also this sense that while hannah isn't quite as impossibly physically attractive as all of nate's other dames and all of the rest of them are soooo hot guys she's the most mature and intelligent and worthwhile and he just wasn't man enough to value the right things about a woman in order to want to keep her i'm just saying if my man dropped me for some insipid hotter chick this is the kind of rebuttal i would not so secretly want to write you can't handle me i'm just too mature for you i enjoyed the way the different characters roughly stood in for different philosophies about dating and relationships nate juliet hannah jason aurit and eugene and all seem to represent different perspectives on the romance thing and the battle of the sexes stuff i don't think any of the theories clearly win out but this book is probably pretty realistic about the draw that a super smart 30 year old harvard grad experiencing literary success in new york has on a certain category of women even though he has a paunch and a filthy apartment and the fact that women in their thirties are hungrier for relationships than women in their twenties but nathaniel p is still a pain in the ass albeit one i would probably be attracted to shhhhh and i think the book doesn't necessarily endorse his views on the irrationality of women and that his pseudo sensitive nice guy feminism is supposed to be sort of annoying and disingenuous i mean i believe that he thinks he's being sincere but i think the book is making fun of him a bit oh and lots of good minor characters in spite of the fact that his friend jason is supposed to be shallow and terrible about women i quite liked him and aurit the pushy aggressive woman for whom nate has the most intellectual respect but still thinks is fundamentally irrational i was pretty much on board with aurit all the way","1461":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was my favorite book i've read this year it was funny touching revealing witty and fun to read i would recommend it to anyone waldman brilliantly wrote the novel in the perspective of the protagonist nate nate is a 30 something literary type living in brooklyn his career is just starting to take off after years of struggle he's happy with his life he has a book deal he's writing reviews for magazines he has lots of friends and he dates his dating life is what the book revo this was my favorite book i've read this year it was funny touching revealing witty and fun to read i would recommend it to anyone waldman brilliantly wrote the novel in the perspective of the protagonist nate nate is a 30 something literary type living in brooklyn his career is just starting to take off after years of struggle he's happy with his life he has a book deal he's writing reviews for magazines he has lots of friends and he dates his dating life is what the book revolves around as you would've guessed from the title but here's where the book gets really interesting waldman plays it out as a comedy of manners must like edith wharton or jane austen the difference this time is the perspective instead of a woman as the protagonist and the rupture of social constraints as the propelling force in the novel we meet a singularly and singlely happy male and a cast of characters who try incredibly hard to figure out social constructs that simply do not exist nate is happy in his life he's dating because he likes the company of intelligent or not so intelligent women and he likes sex he isn't seeking a soulmate a partner or a wife he was not popular in high school or college but is finding that as he becomes successful in the literary world he becomes more appealing to the type of women he believes he should be meeting the reader first meets him in an awkward encounter on the subway what is the social cue for approaching a woman you accidentally got pregnant but realized even before that that there was no future are you supposed to check in with her periodically what do you say when you see her on the street months later and even more what do you do when she's obviously upset but you have to brush her off because you are on your way to your ex girlfriend now just friend's house for a dinner party and you know she'll be upset if you're late such are the turmoils of nate's dating life until he meets hannah hannah is probably identifiable for most affluent women in their mid twenties or thirties you don't have to live in brooklyn or be a writer to understand her she is wary of nate at first but when things start going well gives in and lets herself fall in love with him nate however as the reader sees through waldman's talented use of free indirect discourse is not so sure everything seems great yeah but sometime's he's just tired sometime he just doesn't want to mark conversation sometimes he doesn't call hannah for days and yes he's still interested in other women but he likes hannah so he writes off his doubt pushes it to the back of his mind and keeps up the charade nate's struggle is with himself and where he fits into society he doesn't purposefully try to upset the women he dates he doesn't want to hurt them but he inevitably does he play a role he thinks he is supposed to until he gets tired of it he is the dutiful boyfriend when he feels like it waldman also dissects hannah's actions through nate's eyes and gives an interesting perspective on male vs female roles in relationships as well as communication styles the other characters in the novel are just as colorful and interesting as hannah and nick nick's friends are constantly trying to impress one another with theories on life dating sex politics bourgeois practices and gentrification they judge each other for their lifestyles who they're dating and where their last article was published the young literary scene in brooklyn is very similar to wharton's old new york with everyone knowing everyone and talking behind their backs the difference again is that in wharton's novels there is a specific code of conduct that everyone knows waldman brings the reader's attention to the very lack of this code in present day new york more","1462":"the book was very well written and i really enjoyed aspects of it but overall i thought that the characters were a little flat and predictable i also couldn't shake the feeling that the author really disliked the characters and her contempt showed through uncomfortably in places","1463":"any woman who has ever been broken up with by a man in new york city specifically a man who is a writer or works in media must read this book it hit closer to home than i'd like to admit and to me that is one of the hallmarks of a truly great novel","1464":" i couldn't finish this book i got about 70 pages in and i realized that nothing had happened so far and nothing was going to happen for the duration of the book i felt like the author was trying to show me how intelligent she was through the main character there are continuous assaults of politics and society etc etc etc by nate and his acquaintances the main character is also annoying and self involved i'm not sure if eventually i'm supposed to come to realize this is endearing or he's going to change or what but i'm not sticking around to find out","1465":"even though it was fairly short i got kind of bored with itmostly because this same kind of guy is all over okcupid","1466":"i wanted to love this book i thought i would but early on i just found myself hating it more and more with each page there was a section of about 30 pages that i enjoyed a bit but then it all fell apart the prose tried too hard to be smart and it showed it was overwritten and half the words felt like they were replaced by use of a thesaurus the biggest problem was the voice of the book and how the main character was treated it felt like the narrator and waldman hated nate hated him i have no problem with a character being unlikable waldman could have written an unlikable character and not passed judgment on him left it to the reader she passes judgment on nate the tone of the book ends up coming off as a scorned woman done wrong by her man drunk and rambling to friends about how badly she was treated not a good look at all","1467":"i guess i'm gonna reserve 1 stars for books i just couldn't bring myself to finish since most of the time i feel the need to finish something i started i'm not even being feminist or anti feminist or whatever but i honestly don't like the writing style i felt like i was reading an incoherent string of argumentative essays page after page there's absolutely no flow or forward momentum to the story after 100 pages i still couldn't get a good grasp of what any of the characters were like","1468":"i had this book on my to read list for a long time since it came out a few times i did feel waldman was super insightful about the nuances of relationships and i wasn't so much repelled by nate since i don't think it's relevant whether or not i like a character ultimately i thought the writing was long winded and resorted to irrelevant descriptors to fill space i found myself looking forward to finishing it which i suppose like in a relationship is not a good sign","1469":" i want to give adelle waldman a hug then introduce her to the men in my life real men are there really dudes out there like nathaniel p i guess so and i guess i have met them but jesus i never knew what it would be like to be in their head i am scarred for life i read in a previous goodreads review of this book that said there is not a plot so i was prepared for the lack of story development most of it is nate's long self important inner monologue what is the opposite of a pseudo intellectual someone so intellectual that they actually circle back to being an idiot i am sure there is a word and i am sure waldman knows it i am also sure i would have to look that word up like many of the words in love affairs damn that girl has a vocabulary i digress if it was waldman's intention of making a fool out of the men in her life that treated her wrong she succeeded nate is one of the worst characters i have ever read i found it interesting that waldman never went into a full description of what nate looking like even now after reading a pretty intimate description of him his face is still blurry i image him in a plaid button up and jeans a man who could blend in every crowd he was in putting himself out there in no way so he can judge all who do for all the hatred i feel for the main character i would recommend this book just be prepared to roll your eyes a lot","1470":"i love a good character driven novel and this did not disappoint adelle waldman did a great job of getting into the head of a selfish 30 something obsessed with his liberal guilt being viewed as a success and thin women he would be very easy to hate but the author manages to make him sympathetic by sharing the circuitous path that takes him to his thoughtless sounding words i really liked the discrepancy between what we knew was going on in nate's head compared with what he actually said overall a light but thought provoking read that made me more grateful than ever that i'm not part of the upper middle class publishing world in brooklyn blech","1471":"i kept picturing the protagonist as jonathan franzen and therefore hated him","1472":" i couldn't agree more with the reader who compared this to donna tart's although i didn't think about the goldfinch when i was reading this book the book seems to be making so many excuses for nate that it is very close to how my mind thinks which by the way is no man's and because i read every book hoping to find something that contradicts me the sensitivity intellectual ness and the sympathy that it gave to nate didn't help that said i do adore the twist at the end the book embraces a form of feminism that doesn't force women to behave like men or become so sympathetic it's sad but it allows the girl to be a girl a crazy one sure but she gets to be a feminine girl and appreciated for it i'd give it half a star more if i could","1473":"this book had some of the most relatable and questionable characters i've found in a while guess that doesn't reflect too well on me the book takes the somewhat shallow theme of dating among mostly white upper middle class intellectual americans and gives it actual depth it's beautifully written its funny and it's enraging and scary in its accuracy","1474":"i felt like this book just dragged on and on without going anywhere i suppose i shouldn't be surprised that it lacks a plot it is true to its name in following the love affairs of the main character but i just wasn't invested in it i felt like the writer treated her character with the emotional detachment common in jonathan franzen novels but without the biting social commentary or the variety of perspectives i still finished it but did not really enjoy reading it","1475":"interesting although hard to take it as insight into how men think about women when it was written by a woman a bit depressing if only to see that's how this woman thinks men think about women","1476":"rating this four stars because i've decided to just take it as a long joke about masculinity what a complicated read","1477":"cannot believe it's written by a woman loved the story and loved the perspective","1478":"read this at jon's urging i'm not close enough to a lot um modern cosmopolitan men the kind that nate is i suppose so it was interesting if at times crushing to see love and relationships from their perspective i was on the receiving end of the same cool logic that breaks hearts without much remorse the kind that makes you feel out of touch with the way your peers are dating and what they expect when they somewhat kinda form bonds","1479":"it was superbly written but the ending and the protagonist were terrible","1480":"the best thing about this novel is its book jacket i passionately vehemently and unapologetically hate this novel i picked it up because many critics reviewed it favorably and it was on a few end of year best of lists i also haven't read as many female authors as male and am always interested in adding to my list to look for in the future the book as in the title is about the various love affairs of nathaniel p a fickle lazy narcissistic writer living in new york city he floats from one nauseating woman to the next and has these annoying conversations in his head about silly doubts that men simply don't have in other words the female author is attempting to write about the opposite sex and is doing a shitty job essentially this book is sex and the city with carrie being played by nathaniel now there are many books that i enjoy while despising the protagonist in order to overcome this objection either the prose has to be electric or beautiful the main character's unlikeability serves a purpose for the text e g antihero or failing that the plot is exciting this book does none of that it's filled with shallow vapid characters living in a shallow vapid world that reflects the author in a shallow vapid light","1481":"waldman is an exceptional writer but i could only read this book a couple chapters at a time because i despised her protagonist so much i would even go so far to say nathaniel p is one of the most irritating characters in modern fiction enjoy","1482":"well written debut just would have been more fun to read 5 years ago female author tackles dating escapades of privileged male in brooklyn circa 2000s nothing groundbreaking here but the male voice was certainly believable","1483":"nate irritated me to no end but i think waldman does an excellent job of portraying the dating scene in nyc and some of the typical characteristics of bright intellectual men and their struggles with relationships","1484":"i really enjoyed this book but i think that's mostly due to the fact that it spoke to my very specific demographic brooklyn resident of a certain age with a creative intellectual job","1485":"so depressingly accurate on the current dating scene in ny","1486":"read on the recommendation of npr and the economist a send up of writers in brooklyn i didn't find it as clever as others seemed to maybe it's more interesting if you're not the same age as the characters and living in the same neighborhood","1487":"the book topic is light but the characters are interesting and the depiction of modern society stereotypes fun and well observed","1488":"i was really annoyed by the topics of conversation the characters had they were obsessed with classes and making up what is ok and not ok based on their social systems i can't even explain it since i don't talk or think like them i could never hang in their group some small parts of this book were ok and i felt like i was maybe getting an insight into how guys think but not sure if that was worth the read","1489":"worst protagonist ever i felt like the author wanted me to be annoyed yet understanding of nate and the troubles of a 21st century urban relationship but it just didn't work i hated him and his bombastic egotistical social group the one redeeming quality is that we see nate for such a brief period of his life that waldman provides some hope that maybe he'll stop being a total twit","1490":"just because nate knows he's unlikeable it doesn't make him any less so","1491":" i hated the protagonist hated nathaniel p which is unfortunate really since the entire book is about him arrogant self righteous stuck up pretentious i could go on but the writing style was also that way pretentious and grating the writing style struck me as forced perhaps i would feel differently if i liked the main character i could have gotten past the writing style if i liked nate or even tolerated him but i don't like wanting to punch main characters i went back and forth on 2 versus 3 stars so take the rating with a grain of salt i originally went with a 2 since i hated the book then a 3 since i thought the writing was decent and if i hated a character that much it shouldn't impact the rating but i settled for a 2 i shouldn't hate main characters i might not like what they do or appreciate certain aspects of their personality but it's important to root for the main character and i couldn't root for nate","1492":"it took me a while to get through this one i found the beginning a little bit hard to sink into which resulted in me putting this down for 5 months but when i picked it up again i finished it in the same day i'm not really sure how i feel about this book although i'm pretty sure i liked it i was definitely consumed by it to me there felt like there were no truly likable characters since nate is an inherently unlikable narrator and his pov really colors how we see everyone else however i did enjoy aurit from start to finish but that's not necessarily a bad thing i've seen this book compared to hbo's girls a few times and i'm inclined to agree with that comparison both wrt the plotting and the characters that populate both works update 6 13 15 just reread this and enjoyed it immensely really a different experience from my first read through--even when recognizing the flaws in these characters and getting irritated by their behavior i feel like i still empathized with them with the exception of greer 5 stars","1493":" this book was terrible if i was describing it to friends i would say zero out of 10 do not recommend although i am normally a binge reader i often had to take 20 minute breaks between chapters because nathaniel p was such a despicable character he's extremely misogynistic and justifies by thinking 'i'm a feminist if i have these misogynist thoughts it's not because i'm misogynist it's because that's how women really are' as if he's some sort of enlightened god that women should just want to please the book runs through all his failed relationships past present and future throughout the longer thread of his only relationship with a girl who satisfies his intellectual needs but in the end he convinces himself she is neurotic and clingy like everyone else although she is definitively not in the end you have to conclude that he likes having a high maintenance hot chick who is wild in bed smart but not smart enough to challenge him and demanding in a way that keeps him coming back as the reader i have to ask is this what the thoughts of men are really like if so i will be single forever if there was any thing to be learned it was from hannah and aurit never settle and never let a guy make you think you're acting crazy p s i was really disappointed","1494":"tough to get through and no it was not because i didn't get the long stream of pretentious hyper intellectual literary references throughout the protagonist is not the asshole i longed for him to be that would have been juicy and interesting instead he was a self involved snob rather boring clearly the author is bright well read and talented i just wish she chose a different story to pen","1495":" i liked this book more than anticipated my only issue was the entire time i was hyper aware that this seemed like a woman's interpretation of what a man thinks when he loses interest in a woman it was an interesting mental look behind the scenes of a break up but it wasn't necessarily accurate i have never analyzed a relationship as deeply and annoyingly as nate p she also goes into a lot of detail about the clothes women wear a feature of women's writing i always found irritating her characters all have depth and seem real they could be your friends and their interactions with one another seem genuine they are filled with the nuances and weight of history that friendships always have everything relates to past situations not just the present one i enjoyed especially the relationship between nate and aurit his primary female friend all in all the characters gave the book a genuine nature but also made me never ever want to move to brooklyn because they were all pretentious as shit","1496":"reminded me a lot of jay mcinerney really enjoyed this book","1497":" ...she'd get this pinched look on her face as if the sheer extravagance of proust's prose was morally objectionable as if there were children in africa who could have better used those excess words there i have just given you the best line in the book so you may excuse yourself from reading this wildly overrated novel well written but superficial and smugly pretentious with its head so far up its own ass that its navel gazing occurs from the inside of the stomach i read it because i am loosely following the reading aloud podcast's book club i haven't listened to their thoughts yet but let's hope there is some healthy hate in the room","1498":"this book brought me back to my dating years although much has changed since then","1499":"it was interesting to read a female writer's take on guy's trials through relationships but often nate irritated me as a character too self involved and condescending i didn't enjoy his voice and the ending left me feeling unsatisfied","1500":"this is how guys think and how guys think women are witty dry urbane intellectual and amazingly and alarmingly real a pretentious harvard grad in brooklyn a writer who is smart and seems to play at being intellectual dates a variety of women who he always manages to find something wrong with he is at times reflective at times insecure overconfident wise immature able to decompartmentalize at times maddeningly so i found the book both annoying and engaging but honest and very 'today'","1501":"self indulgent ramblings of that prototype terrible brooklyn guy you can't believe your friends keep dating at least it's accurate","1502":"a truly insightful look into the male dating mind it explains a lot but at the same time does not give men an excuse for poor actions while participating in the dating world","1503":"i gave up at about a quarter of the way in self absorbed 20 something literati jerk","1504":"really interesting characters it's always interesting when an author really gets in the head of an opposite sex character and nate's ennui felt very honest","1505":"waldman can write men and most of this book is the psychoanalysis of the antihero and she expertly captures the milieu of the literati of new york the characters narcissists privileged and smart act with consistent internal logic and are relatable despite being frequently insufferable the prose is pretty ordinary but waldman's style is punchy witty and entertaining and her humor is especially good during dialogs it's a quick read fun and insightful into urban relationships of the status conscious you'll recognize some of these situations and people from your own lives waldman is a talent her gift at least as i can tell from this book is that she can intuit the motivations and unconscious workings of social cliques read it if you're looking for something entertaining with a heavy mix of pop psychology","1506":"books that i like tend to feature one or more of the following 1 a compelling plot2 sympathetic or at least interesting characters3 poetic inventive use of language4 intriguing original ideas5 engagement with profound moral or philosophical questionsthis novel is so thoroughly lacking in all of these attributes that i don't understand why it was published let alone why it got so much buzz i finished it only because my book club is discussing it tonight i look forward to venting but honestly i'd rather have back the two hours of my life that i spent reading this book","1507":" bright young men do you feel that chilly wind of exposure somehow adelle waldman has stolen your passive aggressive playbook and published it in her first novel \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" you'll want to tell your female friends that you've heard it's not very good mutter something about how condescending it is to women in the bookstore reshelve copies back in the \"gardening\" section an overreaction i don't think so my daughter just graduated from college but her education won't be complete till she's studied waldman's brilliant taxonomy of homo erectus brooklynitis i'm making her read \"the love affairs of nathaniel p \" in exchange for paying off her student loans not that she'll need much persuading waldman offers a delectable analysis of contemporary dating among literary wannabes you might think it'd be easier to find a parking space in manhattan than to say anything new about that subject but this dark comedy delivers one prickling insight after another admittedly waldman isn't much for plot like an episode of \"girls \" this svelte novel moves through a series of loosely structured conversations -- in an apartment at a trendy restaurant on the way to the subway unlike an episode of \"girls \" though waldman's novel concentrates on the experiences of a young man nathaniel piven is an ambitious intellectual a few years out of harvard which he finds some humble way to drop into every conversation naturally \"the well groomed stylishly clad expensively educated women of publishing found him appealing \" he writes book reviews and cultural criticism for very important magazines and he's just sold a book for a six figure advance which gives him extra cachet amid this tiny subspecies of new yorkers who chart each other's ascendancy with the solemnity of renaissance astronomers i don't want to give the misimpression that there's anything trite or grasping about him waldman's hero is a perfectly upstanding guy \"nathaniel piven \" she tells us at the opening \"was a product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education he had learned all about male privilege moreover he was in possession of a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience \" that noisy conscience the epitome of modern \"latte liberalism \" is the real subject of this novel by my count the word \"guilt\" appears more than 20 times in these pages nate feels guilty about almost everything about homeless people on the street about black janitors cleaning up after him about taking the earned income tax credit \"since it was clearly intended for real poor people not harvard grads \" but waldman demonstrates that all his ready guilt is really a kind of salve for a man who's impenetrably selfish in his mind low level remorse has become a viable substitute for actual reformation do you know this man are you this man we first meet nate when he runs into an old girlfriend who tells him off even though \"he had done everything that could have been expected of him \" her animus is a mystery to him deeply troubling \"contrary to what these women seemed to think \" waldman writes \"he was not indifferent to their unhappiness and yet he seemed in spite of himself to provoke it \" over the next 200 pages waldman shows why it's not that nate is a cad in any ordinary sense indeed he's extraordinarily sensitive so unlike his male friends who are still rating women's breasts and telling him to \"stop overthinking like a girl \" while they brag about their sexual exploits nate sips constantly from a \"cocktail of guilt and pity and dread \" but there's something intoxicating about that cocktail and waldman traces it coursing through his blood with clinical precision as though she's diagnosing the symptoms of a functional alcoholic although \"the love affairs\" makes reference to several previous and future love affairs in nate's life the novel concentrates on one promising relationship with an attractive freelance writer named hannah we see them meet date and become a couple but the real action of the novel remains in nate's analytical mind his tireless attention to the filament of desire falling in love is so lovely but this is a time lapse photo of the bouquet withering \"when you're single \" nate thinks \"your weekend days are wide open vistas that extend in every direction in a relationship they're like the sky over manhattan punctuated hemmed in compressed \"waldman's finest work here is letting us see the first spores of mold settle on nate's heart panicked he grows cold confronted he apologizes rinse and repeat in a pose of perfect reasonableness until his lover is reduced to a madwoman whose fury and tears he can pity and forgive -- and abandon \"it was not always unpleasant to deal with a hysterical woman \" waldman says in her best 21st century jane austen voice \"one feels so thoroughly righteous in comparison \"neither chick lit nor lad lit \"the love affairs\" presents a series of scenes that lay out exactly what's so maddening about this young man -- and to be fair many of the grasping self absorbed women who throw up their hands at him waldman has captured a whole group of privileged people who've been seduced into believing that their choice of a spouse is just one more consumer purchase -- like an expensive coffee maker something to be considered according to its pros and cons and then constantly reevaluated for how much it satisfies the original expectations in one comically poisonous scene as hannah tries to figure out why he's grown so distant nate stops listening to her and notices that \"when she moved her arms in emphasis the skin underneath jiggled a little bit like a much older woman's it was odd because she was quite fit he felt bad for noticing and worse for being a little repelled and yet he was transfixed the distaste he felt in its crystalline purity was perversely pleasurable he kept waiting for her to wave her arms again \"these are rarefied creatures to be sure with their \"cushy jobs and preening social consciences \" but handling them this wittily and wisely waldman attains something like the universal truths an older female writer articulated by recording the antics of a group of genteel folk in early 19th century bath how far have we come really in the 50 years since john updike's rabbit bounded across america satisfying his appetites nursing his hurt feelings and offering up his glib apologies in a dead suburb of pennsylvania or the hippest neighborhood of brooklyn he still runs ah runs runs women let him go","1508":"how does this woman know so much about us","1509":" i wanted to love this book it has a few exquisite moments where waldman just peers into the soul of humanity but she couldn't sustain it that's a high bar the story was quite enjoyable the insights were sometimes delightful i wanted to meet the characters in the book i'm not sure i could be friends with them but i would like to meet them and listen to them talk and ponder relationships and life i would like to try this either says something about my need for friends or it says something about waldman's ability to create flawed but generally likable characters","1510":"i wish i could write this intelligently and i wish i could get into the ever confusing mind of the new york relationship as waldman has done in this book","1511":"a thinkpiece turned fiction that spawned many thinkpieces apparently the result of east coast snobbishness about other elite east coasters that in theory should sell well to middle america if only they wouldn't end up responded with what are they all on about also inartful prose","1512":"i really hated the main character but liked the book overall because i hated the main character the writing was that good","1513":"made it 25 pages but it was too descriptive self absorbed uninteresting to continue","1514":"3 5 stars the love affairs of nathaniel p by adelle waldman takes you into the mind of a man with good intentions who still ends up being a jerk to nearly every woman he dates whether he loves her or not this is the first time i've felt a book would've been better if written by a man because there are parts that might give a greater understanding of them until you remember it's fiction written by a woman who could be grasping at straws the story also lacked color outside of mentioning the protagonist's surroundings he was a struggling writer living in the hood i enjoy books about love and relationships though plus it leans heavy on the literary lives of new yorkers another aspect that kept me interested it also made me think we may need to charter an #sbwwzo branch for our anglo sistren the writing was a little too high brow for the subject matter but it was a cool read that kept my attention nonetheless","1515":"i really enjoyed this one a more intellectual and realistic take on romantic comedy and told from a man's perspective which gave it a unique twist the main character's internal dialogue was witty and thought provoking","1516":"entertaining i actually looked several times to see if this was written by a man neat perspective of a man's views of relationships from a female writer mindless reading","1517":" in this pitch perfect first novel adelle waldman captures with painful accuracy a certain generation and class of thirty somethings npr listening kale eating new yorker reading aspiring writers who live in brooklyn and mostly graduated from ivy leagues the characters' self involvement petty comparisons to one another personal and professional and myopic vision of their own lives and the lives of those in their circles hits close to home hence the painful part and yet is so delicately and perfectly rendered that the book is truly an achievement yes these characters can be exasperating but they are accurately portrayed and yes the book is so readable and about such fluffy matters the courtship of navel gazing thirty somethings that it may at first appear to be light a beach read but it's anything but waldman's touch is deft and the ultimate result is searing just read the critical reviews they love her and with good reason a classic chapter opening ooh kale cara said i never could find kale in baltimore nate and hannah and mark smiled in sympathy how's the job search terrible that's to be expected i guess everyone i know who is my age is vastly overqualified for the jobs that are out there i mean answering phones she shook her head it's a real problem","1518":" this is about a bunch of people who think they are very sophisticated intelligent and entertaining in fact almost all of them are shallow and dull and the things they talk about in length are so not important i wish they get a life with real things happening to them their leader is nate the most brillant of all he is the average kind of guy with average thoughts about women and relationships i'm convinced he should be seen as asshole who treats his girlfriends with ignorance actually he's always turning every little detail over in his mind and is not the bad guy at all so what's the message a female writer writing from the male point of view who manages to make me feel bad for all men who have to deal with women like those in the novel okay no message to find my advice certain kind of men should not hook up with certain kinds of women or not at all i still felt pretty entertained it was the kind of entertainment you feel when eaves dropping at a party where you are so totally out of place and going home with a sense of thankfulness that not all people are like those very brilliant very sophisticated coughs people you've seen there","1519":"this book was wonderfully written i found that i learned several new words and phrases i just wish i loved the story as much as i loved the author's writing style it held my interest plenty but i was left feeling disappointed by the anticlimactic ending i guess that was the point of the book to be a realistic depiction of life for a man like nathaniel but realism is generally not what i look for in a work of fiction","1520":"it was not at all unnerving reading an incisive book about the romantic relationships of a thirtysomething writer named nathaniel who lives in brooklyn not at all","1521":"i'm so torn about what rating to give this book i loved the fact that a woman was able to write so seemingly accurately about what goes on in a man's mind this book kept me interested and wanting to read on however the ending was basically my worst fears confirmed that being said it is the ending that is the honest to god truth in his day and age it's like having the truth you want to ignore thrown in your face and it saddened me","1522":"rarely have i felt such apathetic distain for a protagonist he's not the guy you love to hate he's just a guy you really don't care to be around i slogged through to the end but was thoroughly disengaged by the second or third chapter","1523":" despite its apparently being a satirical jab at self absorbed privileged white guys this is every bit as tedious as reading the real unironic memoirs of said specimen the problem with having an unlikeable protagonist within a circle of unlikeable secondary characters is that i actually don't care what happens next to any of them and since the story plods along very slowly as nate gazes infinitely into his navel and pulls out nothing of value there's little incentive to read on it's difficult to work out how much of the pseudointellectual dribble belongs to the characters themselves and how much is the author letting you know how clever she is everyone is so smug so knowing so joyless and icily hip and unfortunately that self congratulatory vibe extends to the book itself this could have been smart and incisive but what it feels like is more akin to the time some guy followed me from room to room at a party talking about his zine","1524":"dude is never going to get it unless this book is a subtle cheerleader for polyamory seriously i'd run so far away from him i'd rather be lonely all the time than sad or confused this book actually made me glad to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't disguise drama behind a thin veil of intellectualism by the end of the novel i wished nate's face was the book so i could drop kick that sucker into the garbage can","1525":"why was this book published awful","1526":"the story is about a guy named nathaniel and his affairs with women though love is completely missing from the entire book a sort of chuck lit male version of chic lit a grown up version of wonder years only without any emotion the setting is of a literary circle which is a buzzing potpourri of ambition competition and insecurities the author uses heavy english words like solipsistic to prove that this is a literary circle of well read and well bred people it's like a thing amongst the literary sorts to be perceptive judgmental and use interesting and heavy words to describe regular boring people and situations it intends to be a book about what women really want but it seemed like what men think women want mostly ending up being lame and shoddy interpretation as nathaniel shuffles from one affair to another or one girl to another without realizing what the woman wants or he himself wants the irony is that in most man woman conversations men are depicted to not understand what the woman is saying or her underlying emotions or needs but here he sort of feels what he is doing is wrong but still refuses to acknowledge or give that is straight mean if not mean then intentional ignorance the desire to be wrong because being right is tougher job to do the consistent obsession of the west that something is wrong with them it's like they want to blame their actions on their dysfunctional brains backgrounds and families rather than taking any ownership hoping to find a psychiatrist who would listen and give them a magic mantra to put their life in place \"ohhh i think this is how my relation is this is what went wrong or right \" but i won't talk about this to my lover because he she has no time or my ego is too big to really talk and sort it out so let me write or blog about it and tell the whole world who will understand it better hoping the subject doesn't read it and if he she does read it i am sure they will appreciate how i feel about them and how beautifully i put it in words more of a theoretical exercise of writing literary articles discussing and debating about it in public or intellectual forums about the problems instead of solving them or talking to the one person whom it really concerns a completely lame book with no connect to love in relationships instead driven by hormonal urges and mental insecurities he was violating an implicit rule of dinner party etiquette conversation was supposed to be ornamental aimed to amuse one wasn't supposed to be invested in the content of what was said only the tone juliet's strides were long and determined but she moved stiffly like a person determined not to let on that her shoes hurt her feet i think it's vanity to want it both ways you know to want to write books because that's your thing but also to want to be treated like a rock star the rich enjoy being hospitable to smart artsy types they need an audience of people discerning enough to truly appreciate all they have it helps them to enjoy it more","1527":"turns out nathaniel p is a self absorbed rotter end of story","1528":"the love affairs of nathaniel p follows the life over a couple of years of a member of the brooklyn literary set who has recently received a 6 figure advance for his first novel completely told from his point of view it charts his path through relationships with friends but mainly partners set against a backdrop of gentrifying brooklyn and literary manhattan i have to admit that rarely have i disliked a lead character more in a book than i did nathaniel p he is convinced of and comments on his superior intellect on numerous occasions at times calling it his affliction and interacts with others with an astonishing lack of empathy how such a character could conceivably write fiction supposedly what people read to develop empathy is debatable but that aside i found myself shaking my head in disbelief on several occasions while listening to this audiobook the one character with any depth hannah is treated appallingly but thankfully as the story enters its final phase comes out a stronger person nathaniel in my eyes learns nothing and probably ends up with someone he deserves aside from the horrible characters the novel's saving grace for me was its setting i enjoyed reading about the changing neighbourhoods in brooklyn with their renovated living spaces trendy cafes and faux dive bars and their juxtaposition with the old fixtures and individuals on the same streets similarly i always enjoy reading of downtown manhattan and was delighted to hear a reference to my new favourite bookstore the strand within the book's pages all in all this novel is obviously a satirisation of the literary scene in brooklyn which possibly goes a little too far making it less than believable i wouldn't necessarily recommend it per se but still found it a pretty enjoyable read","1529":"i'm trying to ration my five star ratings lately but this one came close read it and weep ladies","1530":"i don't know how to approach reviewing this book this is a good book insightful true to life observant this is a depressing book for the above reasons if i ever end up living the sort of life led by nathaniel p u0026amp co someone please come to take me out of my misery is it sad that the ending seems inevitable and right all the intellectual types who populate this book seem miserable all the fancy trappings of that specific kind of lifestyle seem far from worth it","1531":" as i read this book it became more and more oppressively claustrophobically the brooklyn journalistic literary scene while it was amusing at first it was not nearly amusing enough to sustain even its relatively slender length and while much of it rang true and there was something impressive and borderline titillating about a woman inhabiting a man's head to the degree that adelle waldman pulled off in this book that was not enough to transcend what felt like a narrow setting and an all too ordinary setting of a 20 something going from affair to affair if it had more of a plot or a purpose it might have felt different than the exploration of a social setting and the rise and fall of a relationship within that setting that said it was well written and i would certainly consider reading waldman's next book","1532":"a brilliant novel just brilliant the best characters can sound reasonable and convincing even when making convoluted and borderline immoral arguments nathaniel does this over and over again his vision is so consistent and so couched in feminist principles that we really want to believe he's right when he decides over and over again to act like an ass and is he even acting like an ass if so why i found myself running up against these questions throughout and i don't mean to say that this novel read like some thought experiment i was deeply invested in the plot in every sunday morning where they do or do not go to brunch in every freelance assignment where nate can or cannot simply ignore hannah to do his work and of course in every fight that may or may not end the relationship i was in it man my only concern is whether this novel will hold up over the decades or if it was too much of a particular time and place now where i live i'll be reading it again to find out","1533":"i probably can't objectively rate a book that opens with dinner party of 30 year olds in greenpoint","1534":"extremely smart and i think the jane austen for brooklyn idea isn't far off fun to read if somewhat short on plot most action transpires in nate's head a little more intellectually hefty than girls but not that much","1535":"no doubt about it nate is not the most lovable character you'll come across but somehow the story works and some of its insights re love and relationships amid the backdrop of trying to make it in nyc felt relatable the fact that the author is female kept popping into my mind as i read some of the more frustrating moments of the story both as distraction and as a means of giving the character more of a pass for bad behavior i'm still not sure how i feel about that though","1536":"this book ended in the nick if time for me i could not bear to listen to these pretentious wind bags bloviate for one more page enjoyed this character study though the author gives the character a faceted enough personality to keep changing your mind about him which i think was the point","1537":"maybe i'm just too old for this book i couldn't see what all the hype was about the characters were annoying and oh so self involved","1538":"this book annoyed me to no end","1539":"yuppie brooklyn chick lit kind of annoying","1540":" spoiler alert keep reading if you do not mind or have already read this book i've read quite a few of jonathan tropper's books and it's easy to make a comparison to tropper's books the main character here is also from the perspective of a early 30's male at a point in his life where he is dating casually looking for a deeper relationship much like tropper's books where waldman and tropper's main male characters diverge is that tropper's character is more misogynistic in that it seems women just naturally gravitates towards him even though he does not have particularly attractive traits the main character in waldman's book nate seems more pensive and internalizes a lot more of his thoughts but at the same time the reader is left wondering what he's really looking for in a relationship he is complex but uncertain of himself at the same time nate appears to not know what he wants out of a relationship and takes things and women for granted which makes the reader wonder if that's how waldman's outlook on males in relationships in general is the ending of this book was also a little too quick for my taste it seems like the majority of the book was focused on nate dating a woman that ultimately fails despite this failure nate wastes no time at all getting into the next relationship and the last chapter seems to tie his new relationship up nice and cleanly and everyone seems to get what they want in a mere chapter whereas the previous 10 chapters dwells on the problems and shortcomings of a failed relationship it seems to me like waldman rushed the ending overall it was a good perspective not to mention an interesting one to hear the male's side of the relationship told from a female author's voice perspective","1541":"sort of in the lad lit genre but not written by a lad hmm an annoying look at how the other half thinks nerdy guy who just got a book deal who has a paunch yet a few months into a relationship starts criticizing his girlfriend to himself on such things as the fact that her arms jiggle a bit and her friends or full length mirror should have told her that her jeans make her butt look too big unfortunately an all too true look at dating among the late 20s 30s crowd particularly the nyc dating scene makes you glad that you are no longer that age ladies stay strong and don't put up with that b s or be so desperate to want a boyfriend that you will settle for these pseudo intellectual types i think this book will appeal to those who enjoy hbo's girls and who are living that life","1542":"got great pre pub reviews but really a waste of time self absorbed characters no plot should have been a short very short story","1543":"pleasant easy well written nicely crafted profiles of insufferable people","1544":" i don't know whether this book provides an accurate account of life as a freelance writer in brooklyn i also don't know if adelle waldman managed to describe accurately what men feel and think in a relationship how can one ever know what men think in relationships all i know is this is _a_ book about relationships i like how multi layered the characters are waldman describes their feelings and thoughts _a lot_ but it never gets boring so whether it's realistic or not i saw in some other reviews that it might not be -- i disagree though who cares if you like a well written casual story about the love life of a chap in brooklyn who happens to write books for a living this is as good as they come","1545":"young new yorkers of a certain ilk","1546":"my personal short list of the best 2013 fiction i feel like this novel got overshadowed by goldfinch mania debut novel by a woman about pretentious boor who wants to be a writer i know i'm the target demographic for this type of thing but this book is more worthy of your time than whatever contemporary fiction you are reading these days","1547":"very disappointed by this book's ending while this book was very well written the plot gradually releases its hold on the reader possibly an easy fun weekend read","1548":"fun novel about dating romance love and commitment it does a good job of slowly maneuvering the reader through a range of emotional feelings towards the main character and definitely doesn't bend over backwards to create the happy ending you might expect looking forward to the movie seems perfect as a modern romance film that has a bit of edginess","1549":"straight people problems","1550":"loved it can't remember the last time i enjoyed reading about such a cad a more accurate title would be the single woman's guidebook to the self entitled millennial sexual man","1551":"my rating is more like 2 1 2 stars the writing was great but the character was so unlikeable i wanted to get a gun and shoot him by the end maybe we were all that self involved when we were single in our late 20s early 30s i really hope not but it doesn't make for endearing characters i did find it curious though that it was written by a woman and would be interested to hear a man's point of view of the character i was so disappointed that it had a happyish ending i was totally rooting against nate","1552":"if i was in the 20 30 year old single urban smart demographic i probably would have loved this book it's smart funny and it shows an interesting character developing his capacity for committed romantic relationships and his impact on the women he gets involved with before he's mature enough to deal with intimacy even though i didn't love it i finished it i suspect waldman's next book will benefit from having written this one","1553":" while i had several chuckles relatively early in this book and did appreciate and relate to a few key moments in the story overall the main character is the most self centered self indulgent just plain selfish person i've ever shared space in my head with i believe many of the thoughts and feelings nate has about his relationship with hannah are honest but he never attempts to counter balance his self centered point of view reasonable people at least sometimes consider other people's feelings nate is at best a petulant child and at worst a sociopath other's have pointed out how little actually happens in this book any instances of dialogue are brief and when they last for more than a line or two rarely feel natural i believe the author nails the feelings of doubt and the fear of losing one's freedom and sense of individuality when entering a relationship but i have so little empathy for her pompous main character that i don't want to identify myself with him perhaps that's what she was going for","1554":"this is advertised as a comedy of manners lies this is a horror book through and through and a very good one at that","1555":"interesting take on dating and relationships from the man's point of view overall i enjoyed the book but something was missing perhaps my own bias on relationships","1556":"i'm not entirely sure how i feel about this book there are parts where i was bored to death trying to complete page after page there are parts where i cant and wont put it down the story line plot might be too close to home that's probably why when it's a happy mood or inspirational i love reading it and when it's sad or hurtful i don't like the book and i hated the character s i know for sure though that i do not like how it end","1557":"so many good observations and insights really worth reading for them alone but doesn't add up to anything meaningful","1558":"i read about half of this book but found the tone and the material very grating he sounded like a self satisfied person i wouldn't really want to know which might be the point i would have watched it in a film it read a bit like a diatribe from a character on girls but didn't really want to spend the time to read the book i didn't finish it but lots of people seem to like it i think the writer is clearly talented and i would look at her future books but just found this narrator a bit too blithely self obsessed","1559":"this is no sugar coating on the love story just the truth about what dating in the modern world is really like","1560":"i liked and disliked the book equally the author wrote a tremendous asshole i've never disliked a main character more i don't know if i would recommend it i cannot decide if it's the main character or the author that is pretentious","1561":"impressively and depressingly accurate account of dating in brooklyn or at least what i assume is the male perspective on that scene nate seemed like the typical not uber masculine or really all that appealing guy who still manages to date a lot of women because the ratios are in his favor","1562":" i was surprised by how much i liked this book the author created characters and situations that kept the pages turning even though i don't really identify with east coast literati and smarty pants bang able youngsters plus the fact ms waldman wrote it all through the pov of a heterosexual male douche bag and i still kept reading raptly was no small feat i have the attention span of a fantail goldfish on acid really i shouldn't be reading anything also i was impressed with how much telling this novel utilized you always hear show don't tell when it comes to fiction writing and this book has to be 90% telling but man ms waldman not only pulls it off she makes telling part of the juggling act itself maybe i'm just not that well read but i don't see that very much you can just open the book to any random page and there's a fantastic example it was the hottest sex they'd had in a long time from a certain perspective say a pornographer's it may have been the hottest sex they'd ever had to show all of these insights via scene and action would make this novel 10x longer because i hope i'm not being being naive or unsophisticated here you get a lot of insightful witty writing here predominantly through the 3rd person omniscient narrator it's the power the believability the nail on the head quality of the figurative language and narration that makes this book so readable for me recommended","1563":"seriously i have to be missing something here for all the rave reviews this novel got i was expecting brilliant and witty this ain't it you know the episode of friends where joey is writing the wedding ceremony for monica and chandler well you know how ross teaches joey how to use the thesaurus in microsoft word this is what it felt like to read this book rather than just saying what she wanted to say the author belabored every sentence making every word in it multisyllabic rather than letting the narrator speak get on with it already i really wanted to love this book on so many levels but when you get right down to it i never liked or disliked the characters and not caring about any character makes for a long 240 pages wading through pages of pretentious multisyllabic verbiage you at least deserve to laugh or smile or think or feel a little i got nothing i'm sorry to say","1564":"interesting scary look into the psyche of the modern man child did not feel like there was any resolution or statement on this particular affliction just observation","1565":"not too sure what to think about this book it's very readable but i think it deals with a generation i do not belong to and i found it personally unrelatable however as a look inside this specific world it is interesting still need to think about this one","1566":"has the feel of sex and the city but from a male point of view the female author does this very convincingly","1567":"excellent writing the lead character was so repulsive i can't give it a higher rating i wish waldman had made him more likable","1568":"wow i really really hated this book especially the protagonist it probably didn't help that he reminded me of someone but he was just not easy to relate to or like i only gave it two stars for the small moments that are very true of dating and over analyzing but if anything this book would make any girl just more insecure and over analyze especially since hannah was rarely wrong in her worries man this book made me angry","1569":" even though nate was a self absorbed dick i liked this he reminded me of someone i know whose name i will certainly not reveal here and so i may have been more sympathetic to him than perhaps i should be i loved the end and really it helped me almost see how people like that end up together in real life in ten years waldman can write his follow up story about being a hen pecked husband by his once beautiful wife now burdened by insecurities harping

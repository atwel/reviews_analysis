this story is beautifully written with a richly evocative sense of time and place as a dc resident i absolutely recognize the northwest of town and well developed characters the plot although much less exciting than i had anticipated works reasonably well what is unfortunately not sufficiently developed is the relationship between sarah and jenny not sufficiently at least to explain sarah's continued obsession with her lost friend 10 years after her apparent death the friendship seems standard and jenny isn't particularly magnetic although we are repeatedly told that she is magnetic the friendship between the girls is even fading when jenny is lost given all this sarah's motivation is too weak to justify her persistent fixation this is unfortunate as it could have been a much better book","2":" my review this was my era i can remember thinking that the soviet union would invade and nuclear war was a reality i really liked this book summary sarah zuckerman and jennifer jones are best friends in an upscale part of washington d c in the politically charged 1980s sarah is the shy wary product of an unhappy home her father abandoned the family to return to his native england her agoraphobic mother is obsessed with fears of nuclear war jenny is an all american girl who has seemingly perfect parents with cold war rhetoric reaching a fever pitch in 1982 the ten year old girls write letters to soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace but only jenny's letter receives a response and sarah is left behind when her friend accepts the kremlin's invitation to visit the ussr and becomes an international media sensation the girls' icy relationship still hasn't thawed when jenny and her parents die tragically in a plane crash in 1985 ten years later sarah is about to graduate from college when she receives a mysterious letter from moscow suggesting that jenny's death might have been a hoax she sets off to the former soviet union in search of the truth but the more she delves into her personal cold war history the harder it is to separate facts from propaganda you are one of them is a taut moving debut about the ways in which we define ourselves against others and the secrets we keep from those who are closest to us in her insightful forensic of a mourned friendship holt illuminates the long lasting sting of abandonment and the measures we take to bring back those we have lost","3":"holt gracefully pushes past the complicated premise of one of them to reveal a realistically barbed adolescent girls' friendship shades of atwood--a high compliment and the slippery nature of the past the novel's embrace of ambiguity--without cheating or playing tricks on the reader--is surprisingly satisfying","4":"great read found so many childhood memories mixed in the history cold war and back story of the main character it's hard to let go of the past especially the ideology of events and people for some it's easier then others maybe that's why more often then not history ends up repeats itself","5":"i would give this book 3 5 if it were possible because i don't think it deserved the full 4 i liked the story and most of the characters i found some of the book a little slow in development but the second half picked up and i wanted to know what was going to happen i was a little disappointed in the ending as well","6":"an intriguing story about growing up in the shadow of the cold war but the timeframe acts as a breakdrop to a story about girlhood friendships and loss holt is brilliant at capturing young friendship and the sense of confusion and tension that happens with grief but also adolescence soviet russia and later moscow is portrayed from the point of view of ex pats and tourists in rich detail that also lends itself to the mystery driving the story is the protagonist's childhood friend dead or is it a hoax in less skillful hands the thriller mystery aspects of the novel could override its literary integrity but holt's writing never lags or plods or rushes i appreciate the way the story is laid out the way it builds and turns and ends i was unsure what to expect when i began this book but i ended up swept away in the story and caring about its narrator and the choices she made the way she felt and where we left her story at the end a compelling and thought provoking read particularly if you want something that has a bit more gravity than a typical summer read","7":"enjoyable for those of us who grew up in the 80s cold war anxiety engrossing detailed depiction of russia i liked the tension and mystery but it didn't really amount to much at the end","8":"really enjoyed the first two thirds of the book but then it just sort of fell flat very visual descriptive writer which i adore","9":"i don't want to give away too much i don't usually like endings like this but in this book it worked","10":"a good summer read","11":"i think that part of the reason that this book resonated so much for me is that i was born six months before the protagonist and like sarah i lived in eastern europe right after college holt captures a 1980s childhood perfectly and her descriptions of 1990's moscow felt so much like what i remember of living in romania at that time so while i clearly had a personal connection to this book i also found the mystery of whether jenny jones was in fact still alive totally compelling i really really wanted to know the rabbit hole that sarah descends into as she tries to track down the truth is dizzying in a good way for the reader and i want to share this with all my other 40 year old friends and say remember remember that","12":"great potential mediocre execution seems to be a running theme in my reading life these days i wanted very much to like this cold war intrigue female friendship a mystery early 90s moscow meditations on truth and knowing people and abandonment but it mostly left me cold i feel like the split on this book usually has to do with how people respond to the ending which i actually liked and felt was appropriate the settings are marvelously rendered and the language is for the most part well handled where this book didn't do it for me was the character development if virtually nothing happens for three hundred pages i'd damn well better know something about your characters that you haven't told me outright three russians teaching their much drunker american guest how to play a simple card game shouldn't leave me knowing more about the rules of durak than about any of the characters the mother was conveniently unstable and obsessive until she wasn't even the childhood friendship was thinly written as though two ten year olds who can't imagine life without each other share little more intimate than an afternoon in the kitchen mixing up lemon juice invisible ink just eh i wasn't offended by reading it but i'll likely have forgotten about it by this time next week and color me annoyed as ever with goodreads' interpretation of what three stars means","13":"a really impressive first novel both for its beautiful writing and its very clever structure it's also a nostalgic kick for those of us growing up during the 1980s taking the real life tale of samantha smith an american girl who wrote to then soviet premier yuri andropov pleading him not to engage in nuclear warfare with the u s and expanding on it also fun to read while binge watching the americans","14":"i thought this was a good book the topic was different but i enjoyed it some twists and turns i didn't expect would recommend to others","15":" you are one of them is exactly what you want populating the sandy corner of your beach blanket this summer enjoyable and thought provoking elliot holt's debut novel manages to open one's eyes a bit without being particularly taxing it's a slight but enjoyable read that occasionally makes a bigger statement about memory friendship and the way these things effect us for our entire lives holt's story of the cold war is one steeped in nostalgia sarah zuckerman the main character is devastated by the loss of her best friend jennifer jones a child ambassador to the soviet union who dies in a mysterious plane crash on a return trip 10 years later sarah is still to some degree mourning the loss of her friend when she receives a mysterious invitation to the soviet union with the promise that jennifer jones is still alive the book jumps pretty smartly between the two time periods with holt front loading the book with character development before diving in to a second half that explores the idea of nostalgia and its effect on individuals and society the death of jennifer jones leaves sarah as a shadow a half self trying to figure understand who she is in the wake of her friend's passing the further she gets in to russia itself struggling to be more than a shadow of american nostalgia and the mystery of jennifer jones the more she realizes what her life has become don't get hung up on the mystery angle here either the book uses it as a means to an end the exploration of a jennifer's unknown life through sarah's eyes a way to explore the inadequacies of her own life the book flies by and though it makes for some solid summer reading it feels rushed at time as if holt had a page limit and was shooting to hit that at the cost of just a bit more heft to the experience that said this book's slightness belies holt's ability to say quite a bit about both the way we remember and the way it effects our lives","16":"please see my review at http readherlikeanopenbook wordpres my blog dedicated to literary fiction by women authors","17":"you are one of them is 8 5 hours of listening read by cassandra campbell there is considerable creative license taken with this book but it is based on a true story do a google search for samantha reed smith for the facts i know there are many authors who do this type of historical fiction but personally i'd rather the author presented the facts they are equally interesting when a novel includes historical detail that is true and integrates it with fictitious characters that's one thing but when the history of a character is distorted for the sake of a book ... it's quite another and that isn't doing justice to the real life character the reader nor the author the reading by cassandra campbell was fine a nice production the topic and history not so much","18":"this is completely absorbing it's a work of tremendous psychological suspense and it's extremely funny by turns wry and humane tart and merciless not only line by line but at a conceptual level it perfectly evokes the paranoia of the cold war 80s but seems completely fresh she does a perfect rendering of girls' friendships in both childhood and young adulthood in all their hot and cold weather and the writing is flawless i highly recommend this when it comes out at the end of may","19":"i was enjoying this book especially the 70s and 80s references but i didn't like the end probably didn't help that the audio book stopped one track short of the actual end of the book and it took two days to finally read the last lines well written i'd probably read the author's next book","20":" reading this i couldn't help but think of the tv show the americans in this story however the main character is someone my age i liked all the 1980s references like the game called mash mansion apartment shack house in which possibilities for the future were limited to four categories scratched on a pad four names of boys we might marry four careers we might have four places we might live the problem is the mystery remains ambiguous the ending unsatisfying and with loose ends 2 5 stars rounded up to 3 because i didn't skim this one","21":"this book really intrigued me from the begining i have always been facinated with russia history etc it was a good book however i really expected more from it more details and more action the ending was good for the main character and i can sympathize more but it make me want to know more","22":"elliott holt paces her novel well by showing how the mayhem in diplomacy between usa and russia during the cold war caused tumult in the early friendship of two young girls driven partially by paranoia loss of identity and the desperate quest in seeking answers the plot jumps continents and decades in showing the fallout between sarah zuckerman and her best friend jennifer jones her name as bleachedly american as her personality while her family is split apart in various ways holt also runs a pretty sharp skewer through the methods of advertising which i always enjoy reading the plot moves so quickly that i found myself reading this in three quick sweeps it's the enjoyable type of topical historical fiction that brushes enough period data in to drop the reader into the world but without being suffocating with the environment view spoiler i really liked sarah's growth in the novel i felt that the pool scene at the end was her camus 'rebel' transformation - asserting herself in a yes till now henceforth no 'i rebel therefore i exist ' hide spoiler","23":" sarah and jenny meet in 1980 when they are ten years old sarah who is shy and whose parents are divorced is drawn to jenny who is outgoing and has a seemingly perfect family sarah's mother is constantly worried about nuclear war and one day sarah suggests to jenny that they write letters to yuri andropov to explain their need for peace in the world andropov answers jenny's letter and she is thrown into the spotlight all of this is a defining moment in sarah's life as it is never mentioned that it was her idea jenny gets caught up in all the media attention and ends up forgetting about sarah and moving on to other friends five years later jenny and her parents are killed in a plane crash sarah has never forgotten about jenny and their friendship so when she's graduating from college and she gets a letter from a girl in moscow saying jenny is still alive she travels there to see if she can find the only true friend she's ever had the book moved along and i felt i really got to know sarah and who hasn't had friendships as a child that didn't last and maybe by high school you and the friend didn't even acknowledge each other but if you were to look back you'd see what a mark that friendship made on your life","24":"i liked this very much","25":"the ending of this book was disappointing to me i think the premise of the book was better than the book but it still wasn't bad i loved the chance to review the minimal amount of russian i know high school made a lifelong russophile out of me","26":" in elliott holt's debut novel you are one of them jenny jones' harbinger of doom comes in the guise of her best friend sarah zuckerman sarah's an anxious kid who grows up in the shadow of a dead sister a father who went back to england and her mother's various anxieties and obsessions one of which is nuclear holocaust caused by the escalating tensions of the cold war people this book is so good that i don't even know where to begin it's the kind of book that while i was in the midst of reading it i would randomly bring it up in conversation just so i could talk about it it demanded talking about read more","27":"enjoyed and loved the ending","28":"nice details of d c and moscow but the narrator's and her mother's sadness their stuck in the past ness got on my nerves after a while","29":"the concept was a good one and it kept me interested but i thought there was quite an abrupt resolution and ending","30":" anyone remember samantha smith thought so she was the 10 year old who wrote tonyuri andropov in 1982 in the midst of the cold war and became briefly the poster child for world peace she then died in a plane crash a few years later but what if she wasnt the only one who wrote a letter elliott holt's story goes from here telling what it might have been like to be samantha's alias jennifer jones best friend sarah survivrs jennifer becoming famous and then dissappearing years later she goes to russia on a hunch that maybe jennifer is still alive best part of story is sarah and her take on people especially ones who leave her great picture of cold war russia and the drunken expat community","31":"exceptional use of setting and tone i couldn't put it down","32":"this debut novel a coming of age story set during the cold war years and after is a study into the many ways people disappoint and defect from our lives this is something sarah zuckerman knows about first hand the book focuses on her friendship with jenny jones and the many ramifications that includes it is a bit of a suspense novel as a mystery unfolds but it does not overwhelm sarah's story of self discovery which centers on revealing truths about jenny as well as herself","33":"i enjoyed this book very much there are underpinnings of tension that one would expect in a novel that derives its meaning from the cold war but really it is a dual coming of age story once where youth's innocence is first lost and again where adult's first sure footed steps are taken this author has serious literary cred and her first novel feels far more polished than the work most authors produce right out of the gate","34":"lots of history too little story","35":"interesting view of cold war tensions viewed from the eyes of an anxious sad preteen narrator ultimately i could not accept the story's premise that the narrator at 22 would still be obsessed by the death of her ex best friend ten years earlier very little plot but nice writing and good voice","36":"full of intrigue and mystery surrounding post cold war america and russia the book is really the classic hero's journey of getting lost in the woods and traveling to find self identity an excellent random pick up at the library and oddly timely for me thank you to the author for writing this concise clear work","37":"such a compelling read a page turner in every sense i love this narrator too how she grows throughout the novel how self aware she is how astute is her perception and understanding by the end of the novel of what it is she's done with her memories and what she must do now beautifully written by the masterful holt can't wait to read her next","38":"accurate rating 3 5 starsthis book was very exciting i was very enticed for the first 75% then i got a little irritated at the lack of new information and vagueness of some of the characters i understand the reasoning for it but the ending just felt inconclusive to me i had a hard time rating this at times i wanted to give it 4 4 5 stars and at other times just 3 i really enjoyed the premise of the book but i felt it could have been better","39":" in 1982 at the height of the cold war two ten year old girls write letters to yuri andropov asking for peace only one jenny gets a response and goes on to make a highly publicized tour of the soviet union several years later she dies with her parents in a mysterious plane crash but did she really die this book is told from the point of view of sarah the friend left behind her feelings of betrayal as her friend becomes famous escalates in popularity at school and drops her the loss she experiences when jenny dies then her hope as she moves to russia to try and find her lost friend holt does a masterful job weaving together history i remember so well those scary cold war days and personal relationships it's the story of a friendship made and broken against the backdrop of possible nuclear war and just how wrenching both of those things can be for an impressionable ten year old girl what i loved most about this book is the unfailingly accurate portrait of russia that elliott holt creates having spent several months in the former soviet union i remember vividly the cynicism the drabness and the alcohol consumption that seemed to define the place and holt captures it all perfectly the book's ambiguous ending is a perfect fit with the bleak uncertain moscow world sarah inhabits","40":"sarah the protagonist was very whiny she was obsessed with her dead friend and that was a little weird i liked her thought process however the way she took past occurrences and related them to events she was experiencing in the book the ending was not satisfactory for me but i think i was expecting that","41":"this book started off ok bit soon became very boring i did finish it but did not enjoy it","42":"during the cold war i was a little kid and i had no idea what was happening while reading this book it intrigued me to look up yuri andrpov and i found that there was a little girl who did write a letter to him named samantha smith who asked him to stop the war but in the book there were similarities between samantha smith and the character in book","43":"i loved it the setting was so unique and original and the story was so sad and touching plus historical i enjoyed learning about russian culture and the way she interspersed the language throughout","44":" i had this book on one of my numerous lists but i have no idea where i got the recommendation for this book from it's not my usual sort of book because i read very few mysteries and ones involving russian spies uh that list is nonexistent but i really enjoyed this for what it is holt does a good job making the spies real people which i think is rare this really isn't plot driven so much as character driven which seems from my limited knowledge i admit to be missing from a lot of mysteries it's also a plus for me that it's a coming of age story which i love","45":"http www goodbookfairy com 2013 09","46":" this is a really cool picture of post cold war russia but apart from that i didn't find any other feature of the story impressive the plot is slow and teasing the characters are all suspicious and shady and the truth is ever elusive other reviewers have raved about the writing and holt has won some prestigious awards but it doesn't seem to stand out on its own for any particular reason that can be attributed to the author since the real merit and skill of the language belongs to the russian that graces this story with its natural beauty","47":"this started out pretty strong and then went nowhere","48":"i enjoyed this it didn't hook me quite enough for four stars but the writing is strong and the story absorbing i especially enjoyed being expertly transported to mid 1990s moscow looking forward to more from holt","49":"i didn't enjoy this moved very slow i listened to over halfway of the book and didn't finish just wasn't holding my interest","50":"i've read this story before the basic plot of a russian trying to trick manipulate a naive american out of money by making up a story or lying to them i didn't really think there was anything new here but the writing was okay so three stars","51":"i can't say that i loved this book the story was ok and too factually similar to the samantha smith story of 1983 however for me who grew up in moscow in the 80's and is almost same age as the main characters it was an interesting trip down the memory lane i remember when samantha smith came to moscow and all the media frenzy the depiction of moscow during cold war is incredibly accurate though i left the country in 1994 the description of the new russia of 1995 is also very familiar to me i don't know if this book would be as interesting to those who were not born in ussr as it was for me i did tell my 18 year old daughter to read it though just so she can see that i did not make up all the stories about our life there","52":" going into this book expecting a who dunnit led for an interesting response to the book's end i was however quickly rapt by sarah zuckerman's journey and by the way author elliott holt created the world of the cold war and the us and russia during the 1980s and 90s holt's masterful weaving of the mystery of jennifer jones and sarah zuckerman's own self realization and transformation is extremely gripping and i found it hard to put down but like many other reviews state if you're looking for a gripping mystery with perfectly resolved unambiguous closure at the end then you won't find it with this book holt sets up the where is jenny question early on by juxtaposing the story of sarah and jenny's friendship with sarah's receipt of the letter from svetlana and subsequent emails implying that jennifer might be alive","53":"beautiful writing vivid description a storyline that lingers","54":"my opinion of this book can be summed up in one word meh i found myself forcing myself to finish it just to find out if jenny was alive","55":" this was a pretty quick read and it was easy to follow the story about two childhood friends one who becomes a young famous peace activist who dies in a plane crash with her family and the other who supports her friend even in death by working with her mother on building a foundation meant to further peace between the us and russia tries to become a mystery one character introduces the possibility that the dead friend is really alive and the surviving friend flies to russia to investigate whether or not it is true although there are some interesting glimpses into russian life in the novel much of it just seems farfetched i can't believe that a bright educated young woman wouldn't just expose the discrepancies in the story she was being told","56":"i'm not sure i can express exactly why but i was totally enthralled by this book everything was perfectly rendered 1980s usa 1990s moscow the main character herself i couldn't stop reading this and now that it's over i miss it","57":"an interesting read quite riveting in parts but ultimately fell a bit flat mostly i think because i couldn't connect with the main character great concept and setting","58":" when two school age girls have a falling out the clash can seem like the outbreak of world war both sides have many friends allies who declare war simply because of loyalty to one party think of them as nato versus the warsaw pact there is no detente and things can quickly get ugly each girl deploys secret agents to spy and gather intelligence on the opposing foe undercover surveillance reveals the weaknesses of each adolescent failings that must be exploited at any cost mutually assured destruction is a given if one of the girls tells a deep dark secret on the other retaliation will be swift and massive in this electrically charged def con 1 environment nuclear war becomes a real possibility as the chances of disarmament plummet this terminology recalls the blackest iciest days of the cold war--the early 1980s--the setting of elliott holt's smart and suspenseful debut you are one of them hostile young girls are not that much different from warring nations best friends sarah zuckerman and jennifer jones write letters to soviet premier yuri andropov in 1982 incredibly the president replies but only to jenny's missive not to sarah's andropov invites jenny and her family to the ussr on a good will tour jenny becomes a celebrity practically overnight but never mentions sarah's letter or the fact that it was all sarah's idea say good bye to that friendship a new cold war between former best friends thus commences then in 1985 jenny and her family die in a plane crash the news devastates sarah sending her into a tail spin because sarah thinks she is defective since those closest to her end up leaving or dying defectors from the soviet union like mikhail baryshnikov vitaly yurchenko and oleg gordievsky fascinate her after college sarah decides to visit russia for the first time she hopes to find a position in journalism in moscow sarah though has another reason to visit moscow she receives a strange letter from a woman who spent time with jenny during her tour of the soviet union and alludes to the possibility that jenny did not actually die in the crash here's where the story turns exciting and interesting especially when sarah comes face to face with a woman who may or may not be jenny holt's ending is intentionally ambiguous however i preferred the vague ending to a clearer conclusion in this instance i liked not knowing i liked closing the book and wondering how one can navigate a course for truth when secrets and lies cloud the way of course the novel's indefinite finale may frustrate some readers but i appreciated the enigmatic mystery the character of jenny is loosely based on samantha smith in december of 1982 smith a ten year old girl from manchester maine wrote a letter to andropov smith asked the soviet premier if he planned to mount a nuclear war against america he replied to her and at his invitation smith toured the soviet union the next year her picture was everywhere and she even became a television actress this little girl was america's youngest ambassador but her life was cruelly cut short in 1985 when she and her parents were killed in a plane crash set in washington d c in the 1980s when star wars was on the minds of moviegoers and presidents alike and in moscow during the 1990s when the world map was constantly being drawn and redrawn you are one of them is fast paced to reflect that fast moving world because the author lived in moscow from 1997 to 1999 her writing radiates with intricate ease as sarah navigates moscow holt is thus able to transport us to a strange new and uncertain russia--a country that was once just as perplexing as the mystery that is at the heart of you are one of them holt excavates the familiar terrain of friendship loyalty betrayal and deception in you are one of them but her penetrating gaze and knowing voice propel her tale far past other novels you are one of them shares the feel of the americans and is just as addictive i was glued to every page of holt's novel i would have endured a nuclear winter to spend more time with these striking and well illustrated characters...well maybe","59":"in my house it's already dark it's already dusty and cold maybe the catastrophe has already happened maybe you think you can destroy us but that is not true we can destroy ourselves","60":"this started out so strong and i was absolutely captivated but the little voice wondering why sarah would be so obsessed grew larger and larger until it was nonchalantly addressed in the final pages excellent writing and i will definitely be watching for the holt's sophomore novel","61":"felt arms length from the story but still interested in seeing how the plot developed","62":"i'd rate this book 3 5 stars those of us who were culturally aware during the 1980s may remember the story of samantha smith she was a young american girl who wrote a letter to then soviet union leader yuri andropov during the height of cold war tensions asking if he was planning to start a nuclear war with the u s and asking for peace she and her family were ultimately invited to be andropov's guests in the soviet union where they spent two weeks on a media tour and smith became a media darling on both sides of the world smith was a peace activist and had just begun an acting career when she and her parents were killed in a plane crash in 1985 smith's story is the basis for elliott holt's intriguing and well told you are one of them in this book however it is insecure needy sarah zuckerman fueled by her mother's growing fear of nuclear war who decides to write a letter to andropov only to have her idea copied by her best friend perky midwestern transplant jenny jones jenny's letter is the one the media and andropov get hold of and while she becomes the media darling and ambassador for american children everywhere sarah is left in her washington home pining for her friend both resenting the attention her friend is getting and feeling relieved it wasn't her letter that andropov responded to and when like smith jenny and her parents die in a plane crash sarah is left to wonder whether her friendship would have lasted had jenny lived it was already deteriorating given jenny's new fame and feeling alone and aimless ten years later sarah receives an email from svetlana a russian woman who was jenny's escort during her trip to russia svetlana claims that jenny's death may have been a hoax simple propaganda and encourages sarah to come to moscow to find the truth still somewhat aimless still reluctant to let anyone else in since jenny's death sarah travels to post perestroika russia where she sees more of the everyday struggles of the russian people and culture than jenny did years ago and as she tries to determine whether she will ever know the truth she also tries to finally move on with her life after so long i've come to understand that some people are suns that pull others into their orbit sarah said but where do you go when your emotional sun disappears and much like in nature can people flourish without that sun you are one of them is a compelling if somewhat improbable story of loss insecurity young friendship and finding one's self holt doesn't whitewash her characters' flaws which makes them both more and less appealing at times but you are driven to continue more because you want to know what ultimately will happen than because you have sympathy for sarah","63":"a beautifully written book about a misunderstood country incredibly readable and enticingly mysterious loved the author's writing style","64":"i loved the writing in this book the first pages had me hooked the depictions of the betrayal of childhood friendship and growing up under the threat of the cold war rang true and i enjoyed the descriptions of ex pats and young russians in post soviet moscow and related to the joy and fear of learning to express oneself in another language and culture the lack of any real resolution was frustrating however both in terms of the plot and the narrator's own life","65":"i'm bummed i caught on so early in the book but still enjoyed it","66":"i really liked this book holt is a talented writer and keeps a steady pace throughout the novel the subject and setting is fascinating the ending is abrupt however i think that is the point truth and what we believe is all about perception","67":" sarah zuckerman lives in dc she feels her most defining factor is that she lost her sister when she was very young this event caused her parents to divorce and her mother to become extremely paranoid the novel explores the friendship between sarah and her friend jennifer jones who moves to dc from ohio both girls write letters to the russian president asking for peace but only jennifer's letter gets answered later jennifer and her parents die in a plane crash or do they i tried to savor this book because i truly enjoyed it but i couldn't put it down highly recommended","68":"you are one of them follows sarah zuckerman from dc to russia as she follows the ghost of her beautiful popular famous childhood friend jennifer jones who died in a small plane crash in the united states following her family's headline producing trip to the ussr the story is less about what actually happens to sarah in moscow--or even what happened in dc many years earlier--and much more about friendship and the ghosts of the past the cold war ussr that jennifer and her family went to visit is not the russia in which sarah lives many years later the russian girl svetlana who accompanied jennifer on her tour now works for an advertising agency that has a british creative director and that is trying to market a russian cola czar the sight of an american in moscow is no longer an oddity and sarah lives with another american expat and follows her to the american journalists' favorite bars and yet sarah spends much of the book almost literally chasing ghosts as she begs svetlana for crumbs of information about jennifer her trip and the jones family she lives in her own memories of childhood and jennifer's death often seems less significant to sarah than the slow death of the friendship between the two girls that started as jennifer became famous then popular after the jones family went to the ussr sarah's views of post cold war russia are often frozen in time in the same way she frequently asks about the kgb and is willing to believe that everyone is was a spy and it takes her a fair amount of time in russia to begin experiencing it for herself instead of treating it as a place to solve a childhood mystery the story of sarah's letting go of jennifer jones and of who she was in that friendship is the real story of this book sarah's progress is slow but palpable as her experience as an expat in russia makes her ready to be just sarah instead of jennifer jones's best friend this is a book that makes you think about which ghosts still haunt you and what kind of journey you need to take so that you can begin to let them go","69":"i really wanted to love this more than i did i had read several glowing reviews so my expectations were probably too high actually in many ways it was really good she captured a lot of the spirit of growing up in the 80's in the sense of the cold war fears with russia seen as the ultimate enemy of the u s and the threat of impending nuclear disaster sort of hanging over the country the whole story centers around the childhood friendship of the narrator and her best friend jenny the girls both write letters to soviet leader yuri andropov asking for peace and jenny gets invited on a media trip to the ussr and a year after she returns she and her family die in a plane crash it jumps ahead later to when the narrator is grown up and gets a strange sign that jenny might possibly still be alive and she goes to russia to investigate the author built up the mystery and it was fascinating to see a picture of russia going through so many changes but i felt like the tension sort of got lost along the way and can i just say that i hate ambiguous endings i know it's supposed to be artistic or something but i really want to know what happened i don't want it left to any kind of interpretation simplistic of me i know there were a lot of good things happening in this novel but it just didn't quite reach the amazing levels i was hoping for","70":"well written flowing story took me back to growing up in dc in the 80's commander salamander cleveland park macomb street etc subtle yet provoking more so now that i am done then while i was reading it i want more plus any book with a faulty towers reference has to be good","71":"you are one of them reads like a really detailed plot summary of a potentially exciting story that at the end of the day never gets told elliott holt throws her well choreographed punches like a girl when she manages to hit the right spot she does it with hesitation when she concentrates on springing up an adequate amount of force she withers halfway before even approaching the target if any redeeming quality helps i can totally see this made into a tinker tailor soldier spy ish movie with a stoic sepia hue and stiflingly precise cinematography much like her prose of which i do approve there are sharp quips galore i guess i shouldn't be surprised that claire messud was at one point her mfa instructor","72":" well this is outside of my usual time periods of choice but i enjoyed it the us ussr relations during the cold war are something i never experienced but were close enough to my time that i have heard a lot about them i really enjoyed the child's view of the period how things must have looked to an elementary school girl and its' mix as a coming of age story about a lonely girl finding her way growing up into herself and letting go of the past was nicely done alongside the larger world view issues i thought the little bit of spy intrigue was well handled it could have become overdone and cliche very easily this was really a lovely exploration of a girl growing up and the turbulent times during which she did it","73":"sad book this is supposed to be about hope but it seemed to me that it covered failure much deeper and more frequently than it covered the hope i wanted to like it more but i didn't 2 5 star for the people knowledge and russian cold descriptions","74":"this novel is not perfect but it's damn good i will have a longer review up soon at cobalt review but the short version is that elliott holt knows how to pull a reader in there is hardly a word out of place and she does setting beautifully which is a particular focus of mine as i read anyway more to come just read the book","75":"i enjoyed the author's description of being a foreigner in russia very well written quick read","76":"jaime went to grade school with this author good read history thrown in there concerning the russians and american's and how it affected 2 girls friendship","77":"terrifically well plotted with fascinating and believable characters","78":"this book was unique and very engaging both are treasured reasons for which reading is such a great joy","79":"this was ok kind of interesting not worth buying but as a library read it was ok apparently it's based on events that really happened in the 80s but i don't remember them at all","80":" i was a first reads winner back in may and unfortunately didn't get around to reading this book until now i'd rate this 3 5 stars i really enjoyed the writing and it was an easy and quick read at times i found sarah to be annoying but given her upbringing and what she experienced in her life and with her parents and her sister's death i guess it's understandable the only weakness for me and hence the 3 5 stars is the fact the ending seemed rushed with all the build up to what happened to jenny i thought it would warrant a few more chapters and deeper insight into what happened","81":"you are one of them is very much outside of my normal genre i was surprised how much i enjoyed the story it's full of deep emotions and interesting twists i will however say to avoid the audio book i was listening to the audiobook and couldn't figure out what i didn't like then i just read the story and really liked it it was the reader","82":"interesting premise a bit dull in execution","83":"3 5 rounded to 4 for me this was a 'what might have been' effort great concept and plot and yet it stayed very one dimensional i would have been happy to spend a bit more time with sarah and her hunt for resolution of the past and the loss experienced i believe this is a debut novel if so i'll say holt is promising and will watch to see what he does next","84":"quietly suspenseful and mysterious i kept my serbian dictionary nearby to see how the russian words in this book compared","85":" another awesome audible com book that keeps me motivated to get to the gym i love sarah the main character and the author certainly helps us to get to know her well i find myself chuckling often as the two friends sarah and jenny grow up in the 70s and 80s talk about flashbacks and memories from historical events to silly news to fads and collectibles of those times i remember it all finished the book had a fairly satisfying ending and i think probably the best way for it to end i would have preferred a little more action or things happening in the middle of the book i found myself just reading so that i could get to the end rather than being intrigued by what i was reading in the middle perhaps this book would have been more interesting if i read it rather than listened to it on audio in an audio book one can get distracted and find one's mind wandering if the content doesn't hold your interest enough especially when there are often quite comical and odd things happening at the gym i mean you blue flannel pants man hershey kiss sweatsuit girl give it up you gotta go faster than that lady and creeper dude but overall i am glad i read it and would recommend it","86":"i feel like holt really wanted to say some big things about life and love and death but the protagonist didn't quite match up to them i just didn't buy a recent college grad having all the relationship experience she seemed to have let alone having all the insight into it that she seemed to have the book as a whole seemed like a strange amalgam of childhood memoir typical chick lit and moscow travel guide that didn't quite mesh i liked the moscow travel guide parts but then maybe i should just take a trip to moscow","87":"oh man this was a great book having lived in a post soviet country for 2 years there was something homecoming esque about reading this and that sense of place allowed me to focus that much closer on the trials and journey of sarah zuckerman the protagonist the ending was in my opinion the perfect ending for this book when this book is available in june you should get your hands on it and devour it","88":"initially intriguing the novel mostly works as a finely crafted ya novel of a girls' friendship then as a young american woman's experience in russia the ending works logically tho not emotionally and its portrait of russia and russians is downright bleak the cold war obviously continues","89":" really a 3 5 sarah and her friend jenny write letters during the cold war and jenny's gets picked up by the media and she goes on a trip to the ussr before she dies in a plane crash when sarah's older she returns to russia to try and reconnect with her friend in more ways than one it was an enjoyable book with themes of trust memory and friendship kept me entertained u0026amp interested but lacked a spark to push it to a 4 star book would still recommend to anyone who thinks it sounds interesting","90":"in you are one of them elliott holt describes the post communist russia of the '90's as a bleak drab place where everyone seems to be pessimistic and paranoid it sounds like a place i would like to have lived","91":"while this book was beautifully written i struggled to pin down the plot the ambiguous ending was obviously intentional but it dropped off too quickly leaving too many loose ends and unanswered questions the author's use of language demonstrates the potential for a great novel though i would be interested in reading her future novels","92":"i liked the set up the details of early 80s friendship and the disorientation of moving abroad were great but it fizzled at the end i think the book was ill served by its publicity materials which suggested it was a mystery so i went into it expecting a mystery and was disappointed when it was not perhaps if someone weren't expecting mystery it would be more satisfying","93":"not really sure about this book at times i liked it but overall didn't really work for me","94":"in the end this book turned out to have a story which was quite different from the one i thought i was reading","95":"3 5 stars listened to this one and stayed interested the whole time i enjoyed learning a bit more about the cold war and russia","96":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is the story of sarah who grew up in the 1980s in washington dc during the tensions with russia she writes a letter to the president of russia asking him to stop making life so difficult her friend jenny decides to write a letter too jenny becomes an

ever really had during one visit to their house sarah finds the letter she wrote the the russian president all crumpled up and shoved behind jenny's bulletin board her letter was never even sent sarah is very hurt years later when sarah is about 20 she receives a letter from a russian woman who knew jenny when her family visited the woman svetlana implies that jenny is still alive u0026amp living in russia sarah decides to go to russia to see what is going on sarah visits many places in russia u0026amp sees a lot of good and bad things the setting is very true to life from my own experience in russia in 1995 after several months svetlana finally arranges for sarah to meet jenny who is called zoya now sarah is so torn on the one hand this woman zoya could be jenny she looks kind of like her u0026amp she knows a lot about their childhood friendship on the other hand zoya is harder than jenny ever was u0026amp she doesn't know certain things like the name of the friend jenny replaced sarah with zoya wants sarah to give her thousands of dollars sarah goes to the pool to see zoya u0026amp see if she has the birthmark that jenny had but after thinking about it she leaves without ever looking it doesn't matter to sarah anymore if jenny is alive or not it is time to leave that part of her life behind she doesnt' give zoya any money she leaves russia u0026amp has her mom shut down their foundation it is time to start her own life more","97":"a well written suspenseful novel that i feel suffered from too many tropes and set pieces","98":"while parts of this book were page turning others dragged samantha smith with a twist","99":"i liked this book a lot it kept my interest and i wanted to know how it would end but the end fell flat for me","100":"interesting book about the cold war friendship and betrayal not sure yet what to make of the ending it really leaves you thinking","101":" this book brought back so many memories of growing up in the 80s during the cold war the author did a great job portraying friendship between young girls during that time i felt that the question of what happened to jenny was resolved the magnolia leaves did it for me but i'd like to know how sarah did after this discovery she was so unhappy all the time jenny had a huge impact on sarah's life it's true that your childhood friends never really leave you but sometimes you need to leave them","102":"kind of interesting but it left me thinking what ended just odd","103":"gah i don't like reading books where nothing really happens","104":"very good very interesting plot had me guessing","105":" this is a story of a friendship gone astray due to some extraordinary circumstances we have all had friendships go astray and most of the time you just move on it's nice to know the person is ok but it's just not the same anymore sarah faces this situation with a good degree of dignity and skepticism in the end it doesn't really matter because life goes on and sarah does not want to be used anymore an interesting look at russia and how it changed and an interesting look at what is really the truth","106":"i've come to understand that some people are suns that pull others into their orbit spies ussr kgb andropov reagan washington dc moscow elliott holt in a book that on the surface is a book of the cold war and the period of nascent capitalism in the russian federation does a great job of describing the delicate relationships between girls and what it means to come to terms with the past can you ever recapture something that used to be there one of the things i enjoyed about this book is how holt's characters come to life for example you can feel the jealousy that occurs between girls sarah and jenny at a young age and when they start to drift apart now that may seem like a ho hum topic but holt's ability to interweave the cold war and 1990s moscow add so much depth it was also cool to learn some stuff about contemporary russian culture with the sochi olympics going on at the moment this is holt's first novel she is a young writer who shows promise i look forward to her next project","107":"i didn't enjoy this book i didn't find it suspenseful didn't enjoy the writing and found the plot lame","108":"marie claire or glamour magazine whichever it was lied to me this book wasn't that great or an interesting read i got through it though it reminded me of that fx show the americans","109":"the narrator of holt's impressive debut is a few years older than me but her story of growing up during the end of the cold war era nuclear disarmament and beginning her adult life in the mid nineties dial up modems stirred up some memories the world has certainly changed since and changed fast sarah the sad girl whose sister died is relieved to make friends with jenny the new arrival in her affluent washington d c neighbourhood when jenny becomes a celebrity by writing a letter to yuri andropov after sarah writes one that goes unnoticed she abandons sarah for the in crowd a few years later jenny is killed in a plane crash she is not the only one to leave sarah her mother retreats into crippling paranoia her father flees to britain and starts a new and improved family sarah tries to mask her sadness but continues to face rejection in college betrayed by friends and boyfriends this is perhaps why she isn't able to let go of her former best friend and heads to moscow when a russian girl who claims to have known jenny sends her a murky invitation the wintry city is a desolate place where the homeless freeze to death ex pats quickly become alcoholics and locals read on the bus not newspapers or magazines but actual books sarah observes holt beautifully captures the time and place and skillfully explores concepts of loyalty and betrayal truth and ambiguity","110":"this book started with some unimaginative and generic characters and cliches but after the first hour i got totally drawn into the story of childhood friendships growing up and expats in russia","111":"was a very quick read but didn't really touch me the way the good ones do","112":"quite engaging well written and full of interesting impressions of life in post soviet russia the lack of resolution for the burning question was a bit of a letdown at the end but if sarah could let go of jenny i guess the reader could too","113":"i loved how holt played with language particularly russian and the english translations they mystery was a bit slow burning for my taste but overall it was compelling my main issue with the book is a point of personal preference i've never had much interest in the cold war particularly the political aspects of it while the book didn't focus too heavily on those aspects of the 80s and 90s they were present particularly in the first half of the book","114":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here my real rating is more like 3 5 stars but i'm going round up because i really wanted to love this book and even though i only liked it i want to see more from this writer as someone who grew up during the cold war and was always fascinated with russia i even visited on a high school student ambassador trip in the late 80s i was excited by the premise of this novel i loved the first 3 4 of the book but the ending felt unsatisfying to me not only because of the ambiguous resolution to th my real rating is more like 3 5 stars but i'm going round up because i really wanted to love this book and even though i only liked it i want to see more from this writer as someone who grew up during the cold war and was always fascinated with russia i even visited on a high school student ambassador trip in the late 80s i was excited by the premise of this novel i loved the first 3 4 of the book but the ending felt unsatisfying to me not only because of the ambiguous resolution to the question is jenny still alive and living in russia but because it felt like the story just abruptly stopped more","115":"read it in one sitting","116":"loved this book i was a child during the early 80's so i could really identify with the main character's recollections of the cold war era fear of nuclear war with the soviet union the author does an amazing job of keeping the suspense high throughout the book with every page you wonder if jennifer is still alive","117":" i came across elliot's work through her experimental writing on twitter and her short fiction so i was looking forward to her first novel two privileged white girls growing up in washington in the 1980's write soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace the more popular one jenny gets invited to visit while our socially awkward narrator sarah gets left out jennie's plane crashes on the flight home where she is presumed dead years later sarah is graduating college and gets word from a woman in russia claiming that sarah is still alive our narrator journeys to russia to find the truth about what happened to this all american ghost that still haunts her the story that unfolds is about friendship coming of age with a dash of cold war espionage holt is much less interested in the classic elements of a thriller although sarah's fate may leave you guessing until the end luckily for us our narrator is incredibly perceptive empathetic and writes beautiful prose about the russian wilderness 4 5","118":"an enjoyable read though i felt like i could never really get a good handle on the narrator perhaps it's first person point of view syndrome but she fell a little flat to me i couldn't reconcile the child sarah and the sarah that would randomly talk about sex and future lovers that perspective was a little difficult for me i was also a bit disappointed by the ending but i won't spoil that this book will be featured on the next episode of summerbooks so tune in to see what renee and i really think www summerbooks podbean com","119":"brilliant but that is what happens when you put the 3 greatest countries in the world together","120":"eh it was okay built a little suspense at the end but overall just okay for me","121":" this novel was just right for me for me rather than a mystery it was an exploration of growing up always feeling rejected and and on the fringe of life wishing for a normal family and finally learning to let go i loved the parallel the narrator draws between her father's abandonment loss of her sister and her best friend and rejection by boyfriends lovers particularly impressive is the way holt emphasizes the parallel between the tensions deceptions and betrayals of the cold war and those of the shifting relationships among adolescent girls the personal and the political are never far apart the same parallel is manifested in sarah's adventures in moscow where the people she meets may or may not be who they say they are and where she continues to struggle to fit in","122":"i liked this book a lot the story was interesting and compelling though the conclusion didn't quite fit for me","123":"an interesting premise but the story ultimately fizzled","124":" this was a strong literary debut in one of my favorite genres a coming of age story when two best friends write letters to soviet premier yuri andropv asking for peace jennifer's letter is publicized and she is asked to visit the usssr becoming an immediate sensation leaving her best friend behind and straining their friendship when jennifer tragically dies in a plane crash perishing along with her parents sarah receives a letter ten years later letting her know that this plane crash might be a hoax sarah heads to russia to get the answers but they might not be the answers she wanted to hear well written but the ending was clipped short of the beauty of the rest of the book i truly enjoyed it and even learning a bit about russian politics surrounding the cold war","125":"holt writes with the sort of crystal clear prose that i feel like a clear middle c would resonate if i hit the novel with a tuning fork the book is perfect without a single misstep precise and real a novel about friendship that ends up somehow also being about cold war spies and the comforts discomforts we hide ourselves in when we are lost","126":"ten year old sarah zuckerman lives in a suburb of washington d c in the turbulent 1980s her mother and father are divorced and her mother stayed in the family home while her father remarried and moved to england her mother is agoraphobic and obsessed with nuclear war this leaves sarah lonely until a girl her age moves in across the street jenny and sarah become inseparable spending most of their time at jenny's house where her family is intact with both parents one day sarah has the idea to write a letter to soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace jenny writes one too and her father promises to mail them later while the family is away sarah who has been given a key goes to feed the cat and notices her letter stuck on a poster board in jenny's room when jenny's letter receives a response from andropov she becomes an overnight celebrity who is invited to russia with her parents tragically the plane home crashes and kills the family ten years later jenny is graduating from college when she receives a letter from a mysterious woman in moscow suggesting jenny's death may have been a hoax sarah was given ten thousand dollars from her father for graduation and decides to fly to russia she had studied russian and finds herself involved in a strange world much like a third world country with the mighty russia falling apart she discovers a greater hoax than anyone suspected","127":"a fun read the plot kind feels forced in the end but i was engaged throughout","128":"good book this story of a young woman haunted by the loss of a childhood friend should speak to young readers as well as those who came of age at the end of the cold war these days it's almost too easy to catch up with old friends but attempts to reconnect on more than a superficial level through social media can be disappointing imagine going in search of a dead friend who might really be alive in post cold war russia where nothing is as it seems or that's what your cold war upbringing and education have made you believe anyway i recommend this book for high school libraries and book clubs so much to talk about after reading this book","129":"makes me want to learn russian lol","130":"i was in grade school in the 1980s but a few years younger than the sarah in the book so i had only a vague understanding of the cold war and nuclear weapons this story is a great look at those years when we sat on the brink of world war iii followed by a look at life in moscow several years later i enjoyed how the author mixed two languages to give the feel of her conversations in moscow and i found myself wanting to learn russian although it's not a love story i appreciated the little bit of flirting with andrei thrown in there both he and svetlana were simultaneously charming and frustrating and you could never be sure how trustworthy they were which was perfect for the story one of my favorite things about this book is the exploration of what it's like to look back on your childhood with an adult perspective i had read in reviews that the end of the story leaves things somewhat ambiguous and i thought i was going to be fine with that but view spoiler the way the mystery was not resolved ended up really bothering me sarah could have looked for the birthmark and still let jenny go regardless of which way it turned out hide spoiler here's a favorite passage it isn't even directly related to the main plot of the book but it stood out to me and reminded me how much i regret spending lots of time and energy chasing the approval of boys the boys at our brother school ranked us according to hotness and as offended as we were by their rampant objectification of us as women there was not a girl among us who didn't secretly long to be on their hot list the boys even devoted a page in their yearbook to the girls they deemed worthy of pinup status it was a predictable group athletic and sun kissed the hair was long the breasts pert we knew the boys weren't worthy of passing judgment on us and yet we had spent our lives chasing approval we had been trained to get a's we were good at taking tests we abided by rules and honor codes before we walked across the cathedral close to play fans at the boys' lacrosse games we brushed our hair glossed our lips they wore helmets they brandished their lacrosse sticks like vikings","131":"the story tells of jenny smith a young american girl who writes to the soviet leader andropov in 1982 and asks that he not start a nuclear war a real girl samantha smith wrote such a letter in that year and became famous the narrator and main character of the novel is sarah zuckerman jenny's best friend in grade school and middle school they grow apart but upon graduating from college in 1995 sarah goes to russia to learn if jenny is alive there or had as everyone believed died in a mysterious plane crash years before i was looking for more about spies and defections but the story is mostly about sarah's coming of age the author writes well but i did not find the main character very interesting","132":" this is when i wish we had half stars in the rating system it was a quick read i would recommend it to friends i enjoyed the narrative style as told by the main character sarah and enjoyed that descriptive over thinking was not over done when an author continually poses question after question about what he oe or she is thinking about what has gone on there is just enough stimulus to let us form our own opinions especially of jenny and her family's disappearance certainly not a full blown mystery but an intrique to the plot i was pleased with how it ended again not all details needed to be known this was a book of coming of age and a friendship the rest just provided an intrigquiging plot i actually got quite caught up in the historical facts of the cold war and my own lack of current knowledge regarding russia it's cities and people so for peaking that interest it deserves 4 stars","133":"this was another interesting coming of age story i was especially interested in it because the second half was set in post soviet russia it's a very different world than when i was studying russian language and culture the narrator was very believable to me as was her need to sort out some important incidents in her earlier life whether or not she made the right choice at the end is up to the reader","134":"thoroughly enjoyed it","135":"i don't normally read this type of book but i found it very interesting sarah zuckerman was a very shy 10 yr old when she made friends with the girl across the street after several years the girls thought about writing to a famous person in russia asking for peace jennifer got a letter back from andreandrapopov inviting her and her family to visit russia sarah was very upset that she didn't get a letter back because she had written one too jennifer and her family disappeared and supposed to have been killed in a plane crash this is the story of jennifer hunting for her friend who was supposed to be alive very good book surprise ending","136":"meh the title is the most interesting part of the story i guess it's a coming of age story with a twist","137":" this seems to be one of those love it or hate it books i didn't hate it but the scale tipped towards the weak end the premise was interesting enough a childhood friend who may not have died in a plane crash after all an especially intriguing may not since she had just visited moscow during the cold war but the book never measured up maybe i wanted more mystery maybe i just wasn't that interested in the friendship ups and downs of 10 year old girls maybe moscow was too dreary maybe the author gave the main character too many passes on having no consequences for her actions she seemed to stay drunk half the time trusted people she shouldn't have and wandered pretty aimlessly through life there was a not so subtle framework of abandonment sister dad mom friend but frankly i didn't care that much i do think the author drew strong visuals with her descriptions and the book wasn't simple or simply written but plot needs to strengthen and characters need to grow up","138":" i enjoyed this book quite a bit i found the story to be interesting and very realistic in the portrayal of how childhood friendships evolve i found the mother characters to be too polarly opposite i found it odd that no one was really interested in moving beyond a tragic childhoood incident the whole going to russia to search for pieces of jenny seemed so odd to me i just wanted her to find her own way long before she did i found the end to be abrupt and not satisfying it was a pretty good book overall but not stellar","139":"small chunks of this book are excellent it's as if the author visualizes a scene and makes it come to life all the chunks did not add up for me however i found the plot so unbelievable that the realness of the characters' interactions could not compel me to care about the outcome","140":"a coming of age cold war spy story told with flashbacks this should be a confusing mess but somehow holt manages to tie together the disparate elements with the theme of defection rejection and loss throughout it wasn't great for me but it was a good read i would give it 3 1 2 stars if i could mrs p","141":"this book is inspired by a true story of a u s teenager who wrote a letter to russia during the cold war i don't remember the event but do remember being caught up in all the fear of a nuclear war that was going on during that time i found the author's writing to be well done and enjoyed the descriptions of that era and her time in moscow and with her russian friends not a mystery novel and not fast moving i enjoyed it","142":"the ending was disappointing in my opinion i liked the rest of the book a lot though it was a very quick read","143":" i found this book interesting because the two central characters were my exact age and the focus was growing up in america during the cold war i realize that they grew up in washington dc and i did not still i found their knowledge of and obsession with the cold war to be a bit absurd she kept referring to major events leaders etc and her memory of these situations i kept thinking i have absolutely no memory of that i have always been a pretty intelligent and aware person even as a child but at the age of 6 or even 10 all of that politics was way above my understanding and interest i realize that they were influenced by their political parents but it seemed just a bit too much if i ignore my above complaint i did find the story very interesting and entertaining i particularly enjoyed the descriptions of her early days in russia it made me want to read more about daily life in modern russia i also enjoyed the description of her early life and the loss of her sister and father the background did help to explain sarah's obsession with this friend and why she would go to such lengths to remember her the ending seemed a bit unreal and forced it was left ambiguous which i liked and i respected the characters end decision but spoiler alert i found it very hard to swallow that she would not be able to identify her best friend after 15 years i have bumped into people i did not know well after 15 years and recognized them without a problem people do not change that much even in a foreign country and language and after an extended period a persons expressions gestures coloring features etc all remain relatively similar","144":"i think this was another freebie from amazon liked the sound of it thought it was going to be a thriller but no it isn't very descriptive more of a travelogue great if you want to visit washington or moscow although this is set during the cold war so times have changed haven't they after all the fretting and worrying by sarah regarding jennifer is she dead is she alive she totally gives up and decides to get on with her life what a waste very disappointed with the ending because it took so long to get there","145":"although i didn't have the same adventures as sarah no dead defected best friend many of the experiences and details of life in 90s moscow are really familiar the author also does a great job depicting preteen mean girl friendships l loved this book not just for nostalgic reasons but also because it's a terrific story","146":"this was a quick read but i couldn't put it down i look forward to more from elliott holt","147":"occasionally annoying frustrating but still an enjoyable read","148":"i enjoyed all the references to dc cleveland park and embassy row and the story was good however compared to the internal dialogue of the first 90% of the book i found that the ending lacked the same level of transparency and insight","149":"mesmerizing from the beginning til the end it's been quite a long time since i could not put down a book","150":"in 1982 washington two ten year old girls impulsively write letters to soviet premier andropov asking for peace sarah and jennifer are best friends but the friendship is stretched when jennifer receives a reply complete with an invitation to visit russia and sarah does not jennifer becomes a media sensation she is interviewed on tv and invited on speaking engagements the two drift apart and then two years later jennifer and her family die in a plane crash their bodies are never found ten years later sarah is about to graduate from college when she receives a letter from russia svetlana met jennifer when she travelled there in 1982 and hints that jennifer may still be alive sarah decides to travel to russia to meet svetlana and to better understand what happened to jennifer this is an unusual book the synopsis above may suggest it's a thriller or at least a novel of suspense but the story is really about sarah's internal journey to move past various losses in her life for a while i was tantalised by the question of whether jennifer is still alive or not i feel like i got an answer to that question although another reader may interpret events differently as it remains somewhat ambiguous the author has spent time living in russia and this comes through clearly in the descriptions of moscow which really bring it to life i was reminded of the book about russia entitled nothing is true and everything is possible that seems to encapsulate the surreal nature of the city that sarah arrives in i admired this book and thought about rating it four stars but in the end i just didn't like it enough nor care sufficiently about sarah and her self absorption","151":"torn between three and four on this one i think i most enjoyed the pop culture references of my childhood great storyline too the narrator's description of herself made her nicely elusive and more interesting and the mom was sharply drawn otherwise the narrator's aloofness caused the other characters to feel flat which i'm still debating if it was just flat or if it made you feel isolated as she does","152":"one of those books i read slower than necessary because i wanted to savor it such a keen sense of place i'm definitely going to look up holt's short fiction","153":" anyone who came of age during the cold war can relate to the protagonist of elliot holt's great debut novel you are one of them sarah zuckerman is living in washington dc rather uneventfully until a headstrong young girl named jennifer jones moves next door and the two become best friends one summer with the specter of nuclear war hanging over the united states the girls decide to write letters to soviet premier yuri andropov jennifer's letter is eventually published and answered and she becomes a media sensation sarah jealous and sad is left behind both literally jennifer is whisked away to moscow and figuratively the story resonated with me on a personal level i can remember doing some of the things sarah and jennifer did with my best friend growing up holt's narrative about girls and how they grow--emotionally and physically--is very relatable we catch up with sarah years later as she enters college and receives a mysterious letter indicating that jennifer presumed dead in a plane crash years ago is really alive and living in russia sarah with funds received from her father sets out to find her long lost friend the story doesn't turn into a thriller or mystery but stays a work of literary fiction it was clearly inspired by the real life story of samantha smith who wrote to andropov in 1982 holt's descriptions of russia even the bitter biting cold make the reader want to book a trip there as soon as possible she scatters little details about moscow and its people throughout the book like a farmer scattering seeds the story isn't always linear we veer back and forth between childhood in washington and adulthood in moscow with sarah and jennifer the conclusion might not be satisfying it wasn't for me but the book is always poignant and never sentimental or sappy highly recommended","154":" elliot holt's you are one of them has an intriguing premise sarah's best friend jenny jones died in a plane crash not long after visiting soviet russia ten years later sarah receives an email from moscow claiming jenny is still alive the delivery unfortunately is not nearly as intriguing much of the book focuses on the failed relationships in sarah's life with her older sister with her father with various lovers part of the book flashes back to sarah and jenny's friendship the latter half covers sarah's experiences in moscow anyone expecting a mystery will be disappointed by the final revelation this book is not genre fiction and fails to follow any generic formula however one of them is a nice example of literary fiction sarah moves to moscow during the mid 90s having lived in ukraine during the late 90s the descriptions of the post soviet era ring true for me holt's descriptions of places people and attitudes feel accurate read this book for the writing and setting and not for the mystery","155":"beautiful crisp writing paired with a truly exciting and yet profound story very good luck to you putting it down at night","156":"you can reinvent yourself with a different alphabet this is the story of two little girls growing up in 1980's washington dc sarah and jennifer sarah's family is dysfunctional the death of her little sister isabel at age 4 her father an englishman leaves his family and returns to the uk seemingly because of sarah's mother's inability to cope with isabel's death and her obsessive behavior regarding the possibility of nuclear war between the us and the ussr sarah is a quiet loner of a girl until a new family moves in across the street the jones family is all american and seems perfect to sarah especially their daughter jennifer sarah and jennifer becomes fast friends they two school girls share secrets and swimming and spend lots of times together for sarah the jones family and their complete normalcy is a respite from her mother's somewhat paranoid antics when sarah announces to jennifer she is writing a letter to yuri andropov the current head of the ussr and jennifer also writes a letter however the outcome of what happens when one of those letter receives a response from andropov himself sarah is an unreliable narrator a smart girl who underestimates her own intelligence and likableness throughout her life and the novel while sarah is quiet and studious jennifer is popular and confident but jennifer isn't as smart as sarah and she is capricious and disloyal sarah struggles with both her mother's problems and fears and her own more rational apprehensions she feels abandoned by both her dead sister and her dad who has remarried and has another child she uses cold war terms to deal with the pain sister and father are both defectors it was easy for me to identify with the reserved intelligent and thoughtful sarah i loved the way the plot is unfurled like an exotic carpet for the reader to carefully examine close up for themselves sarah grows up in the shadow of both her parent's failed marriage with the disappointments of childhood still following and grieving her i didn't know too much about the plot except that one of the girls has a response to her letter and life changes dramatically forever for sarah fast forward to her college years and we learn more about sarah's parents as most young people gradually understand their parents as they grow older sarah's trip to russia also reveals so many things the young sarah might not have understood as unsavvy child i have to say while there were points where i felt the plot was slightly weak i truly enjoyed both the writing and the elegant way the author allows the story to unhurriedly unfold nothing in the story feels forced no storybook endings here but that is hardly the point of this book which is about how well you think you know people especially family and friends those you are closest with in this world i grew up in the 1980s i'm a little older than sarah by 4 years so this book naturally appealed to me i remember worrying about the missiles the two greatest powers on the planet had pointed at one another i was influenced by musicians like sting and u2 and was watching the day after tomorrow the night it first aired if any of these touch points ring a bell with you this book might be for you","157":"this was a really smart compelling story with interesting characters both american and russian but with a slightly unsatisfactory ambiguous ending","158":"liked the author's writing style but did not like the ending felt like answers to my questions that i had wondered thruout the whole story were within my grasp but then they were yanked away at the last minute","159":"good read about post cold war russia the nature of girlhood friendship and loss plot worked out really well for me","160":" i really enjoyed this novel for its pitch perfect portrayal of a girl growing up with an absent father and a depressed fearful mother her growth into a young woman who finally discovers her own strengths and pays attention to her needs the atmosphere of the cold war recreated sly insights into 1980's and washington dc cultures oh and by the way did i mention that there's a mystery to be solved here's the premise what if a ten year old girl who wrote a letter to the soviet premier asking him not to start a nuclear war and who became famous and died along with her parents in an airplane crash had a best friend whose life revolved around her what if that friend discovered that maybe her friend didn't die after all but was living in russia there were only two things i didn't like bout this book one it was too writerly especially at the beginning of the book i wondered if author elliot holt had discovered marx's theory that labor is the source of all value and labored over her writing but it got better the other was that the title was never explained i can live with these flaws for the sake of a psychologically perceptive well told story","161":"his book has many of my favorite elements a female narrator of my generation a foreign location cleverness interesting writing and just enough mystery to keep me turning the pages you might read this book as a mystery about what happened to jenny the narrator's friend who reportedly died in a plane crash as a young girl yes this is the plot but what really got to me is the mystery of growing up that unfolds on the pages i love that this is a book about a young woman finding herself in her search for her friend it's a super added bonus that this journey takes place in d c and moscow i love the description of moscow and how it was experimenting with \"growing up\" in a new post cold war world it was thoroughly enjoyable to spend time with the narrator in an interesting locale on an interesting search","162":"loved it as a cold war buff and rusophile but audible's reader slaughtered her pronunciation fun although a bit melodramatic and not very bright","163":"i loved it this book reminded me so much of lorrie moore's who will run the frog hospital also one of my all time faves really lovely","164":"rumpus i liked the novel's exploration of the mystery of the fulfillment and maybe also the power that moscow and its people might offer to sarah did you think of the story that way holt i didn't think of it in terms of fulfillment and power i was thinking a lot about grief and about how grief turns us into detectives we find ourselves trying to make sense of the loss searching for clues about the person who is no longer in our lives","165":" interesting book i thought it had good character development at the beginning but thought it was weak on character development of later appearing characters sarah depending so strongly on jenny is very like many middle school students and understandable with sarah's background i loved the description of life for the girls in washington and life and culture in russia i have not been to russia but i suspect it was pretty accurate of life there in the 80's i was left unfulfilled by the ending but maybe it had to be that way to show how much sarah had grown i would have given it 3 5 stars if i could this is holt's first novel and i will read more if she writes any","166":"samantha smith has been very important to me for a very long time so i had trouble enjoying a story that plays with her memory i know it's fiction but it still made me uncomfortable i went to the ussr shortly before the time this story takes place so it was interesting comparing my memories to the descriptions of time and place the author described","167":"stars in the end i came down on the side of readability read this if if you'd like a low key spy novel 3 stars fiction american 3 5 star ratingset during the cold war this story revolves around a community of young americans living and working in moscow i had a difficult time deciding on a rating of 3 or 3 1\/2  stars in the end i came down on the side of readability read this if if you'd like a low key spy novel 3 1\/2  stars","168":"prologue wasn't necessary but this was a really good read overall i read it every quickly and very much enjoyed it good story","169":"hard to follow at some points but the ending was good","170":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here while i absolutely loved her style of writing and the story itself the end was rather anti climatic was hoping for a bit more","171":"you gotta love emotional searching combined with cold war intrigue well at least i do the mystery and the emotional vulnerability of the main character intertwine well for a captivating novel it definitely pulled me in it was one that made me have to remind myself that the characters weren't real","172":"this was an unusual book i felt like the suspense mystery of it was overshadowed because most of the book is background i liked the ending though","173":"good compelling story would provide interesting discussion for a book club i used passages from this book for my esl class great illustration of common mistakes for esl students thanks for that","174":"cold war novel with an ambiguous ending fairly interesting if nothing else for the historical background of life during the time period","175":"when sara was 11 she and her best friend jenny decided to write to andrei andropov to let him know that the american people wanted peace somehow jenny's letter was made public and she was invited to visit russia where her activities were followed as she was called an ambassador for peace about a year later she and her family died in a plane crash now in her 30's sara returns to russia following jenny's footsteps wondering why jenny's letter resulted in the publicity","176":" this deceptively quick read tackled some really big themes in a really accessible way it almost reads like ya because half the book consists of the narrator remembering events from her childhood and the things she did with her best friend who she believes died when they were 11 those sections are a triumph of details from a childhood lived in the 1980s several memories she describes brought back immediate visceral memories for me as well having also lived a childhood in the 1980s i found myself remembering things i didn't know still existed in my brain after all these years when she describes jenny's purple pen with the pom pom on top i could feel my own purple pen from fourth grade in my hand again and smell its scented ink several times her memories were so specifically similar to mine that i thought did we have the same childhood the rest of the book takes place in moscow of the 1990s and that world is described with the same economic use of detail you really feel like you were right there and know exactly how it was she is able to paint a really full picture of the culture of post soviet russia in very few words ultimately holt uses the storyline to examine themes of identity friendship and relationships i found myself wondering as i was reading this if i would recognize my third grade best friend if i saw her today i decided i probably wouldn't how much of our appearance is determined by our experiences how well do we really know people even the people we think we know best in the world how does our concept of our own identities affect our perceptions of other people these are huge fascinating questions and holt's book raises all of them without jumping to a saccharine easy resolution i think this would make an excellent book club pick it's taut and well written easy to read but hard to get out of your head","177":"sarah is an introspective young woman who lost her childhood friend jenny after jenny became a celebrity for writing to the russian president yuri andropov when sarah receives a letter saying that jenny may still be alive she visits russia in hope of finding the truth but the truth is elusive and sarah herself is cautious and wary i enjoyed the description of russia and the characters were quite interesting but found it difficult to understand sarah and her lack of passion","178":"first thing to make me want to go back to moscow since i left although that's not exactly the point it's good","179":" there are some books that are hard to nail down into one genre or another and then there are those where the story is so compelling that genre needs not be defined you are one of them is just such a novel while many may wish to claim it as a mystery it is not a mystery in the classical sense of the word the mystery that elliot holt has managed to craft is one about the nature of loss and the way it can leave a person without the essential grounding that we all crave as human beings you are one of them introduces us to sarah a girl who has known loss her entire life the loss of an elder sister when she was just a infant has left her family a shattered shell of what it once was or could have been her mother is reeling and largely closed off emotionally and her father an english ex pat eventually divorces the family and returns to the uk with so much shifting terrain in her young life it is no wonder that when she meets a new neighbor jenny jones at the age of eight she latches on to her first 'real' friend jenny becomes a surrogate sister a confidante a way for sarah to feel normal for once jenny's family becomes sarah's model for the ideal american home while sarah's own mother is home bound with acute agoraphobia and fears of nuclear war jenny's family is the pristine 1980's television sitcom ideal jenny's dad is a 'consultant' in their washington d c area her mother is home baking pies and hosting parties sarah and jenny are the best of best friends until a tragedy conspires to yet again separate sarah from the only 'normal' she has ever known when jenny and her family are killed in a plane crash sarah moves on with her life and tries to sift through her memories that constantly pull her back to the friendship she treasured perhaps too dearly sarah seems to be making amends with her past and ready to move on from university when a mysterious e mail reaches her that hints that things may not be as they seem sarah makes the decision to travel to a foreign land to look for the answers to the questions that still plague her while there is the all to real pain of growing up maneuvering through awkward stages of childhood and the teen years that we all face sarah is a character that has been looking outwardly for the wholeness she has always craved what we begin to realize along with sarah is that no matter one's past finding oneself is a personal choice and when you finally decide you are enough for yourself you discover true freedom this novel is witty engaging fresh and yet nostalgic for me i was really drawn to the story as i was born in the same time that sarah and jenny were the early 1970s and the cultural references and memories of reagan era cold war fears juxtaposed with the consumerism of the 1980's is still so accessible to me i found this a compelling read for so many reasons but the style and pace made it impossible for me to put down bottom line i would recommend this book and i don't think i could define an audience if i tried it will either hit you and you will connect with the story or you may find yourself connecting with the character of sarah and her sad family circumstances either way it is well written well edited and well researched making it a treat for readers who crave something more substantial and less defined every now and then i loved this novel i hope you will too the arc was received from a goodreads first reads giveaway the opinions expressed are my own and have in no way been influenced by goodreads the publisher or the author","180":" good citizen and bad citizen nuclear weaponary war games kgb cia russia and america presidents secrets and defections these all feature somewhere in this storys timeline the author tells the tale of two young girls in america rather wealthy ones who find a war with russia quite scary and decide to due the good deed of writing to the russian president with a letter of concern the main character who as already lost her sister to illness has forged a relationship with one particular schoolmate who catches the hearts of russian officials in her letter and soon finds that she is also lost to a tragic accident the writing never bored with all the americans in russia storytelling it held my interest to the end the story edges around the spy field and defecting it does not go deep undercover but does a good job showing how some citizens defect in its storytelling the tv series the american is doing well in the ratings the russian and american story seems to still pull in interest and so this tale may provide some decent entertainment in its reading a story that has some historical significance","181":"very clever story","182":"i am exactly the age of the protagonist remember the samantha smith story well and thought the picture of 90s newly post soviet russia was absolutely brilliant however having said that it just never quite took off for me","183":"her best friend was celebrated as a advocate for nuclear disarmament by both the us and russian governments then she and her parents died in a plane crash years later as a college graduate she spends time in russia and learns some disturbing news about her friend good description of russia and russian life in the 1990s","184":"i enjoyed this book but felt that the ending was just too rushed to warrant a four start rating","185":" i was intrigued by the title and the recommendation from a review in the wsj alas i was less impressed than i'd hoped with the actual book ms holt has a smooth and elegant writing style and the way she mines her premise based on the true event of an american middle schooler writing a letter to a russian leader that gets answered is unusual her viewpoint character is not the girl jenny but the girl's best friend sarah which is lucky because jenny soon dies in a plane crash half the book takes place when sarah is in her 20's and goes to russia when she gets evidence that her friend jenny is not dead after all but has become a russian citizen the description of moscow the russians sarah meets this is all good stuff not riveting but it held my interest until i could find out whether this mysterious russian woman is in fact the long lost childhood friend jenny spoiler alert we never find out turns out the main character sarah is more interested in finding herself than in actually finding jenny or the truth of what really happened so before she can prove who jenny is and she has the means she packs up and goes back to america i wanted my money back i found jenny more interesting both in childhood and later in russia than i did sarah the narrator sarah is an observer and so involved with herself her sadness over her own family situation her envy and bitterness over getting dumped by jenny in a typical childlhood spat when it was her idea to write the letters anyway that she is much the less engaging personality take jenny fake or real out of the equation and the book falls apart for me i can see where this would wow the mfa crowd but out here in the real world we like plots and resolutions that mean something style isn't worth much if there's no substance behind it","186":" the unstudied workmanship of elliott holt's first novel \"you are one of them\" is enviable the story bobs and weaves through time somehow evading the nasty snags of convenient plot twists while neatly tying off all its threads it reads so well that i was able to finish it in a single sick day you should make the time to do the same holt begins her novel with a degree of mystery and sustains the shrouded tone through to the finish sidestepping sensationalism and delivering a twist \"you are one of them\" is a cold war story and holt captures the fearful tensions of the era in her protagonist's skittish development sarah zuckerman views the world in terms of defection and every loss is a betrayal her sister's young death sets in motion the dissolution of her parents' marriage and her mother's subsequent obsession with nuclear doom in 1982 sarah and her best friend jenny write letters to yuri andropov asking him to spare the world from nuclear war jenny's letter is answered by the russian premier and the young girl is launched to fame as the picture perfect american face of peace keeping she and her parents take a widely publicized tour of the ussr and sarah is left behind wondering why jenny's letter was chosen and not hers the young friendship withers and shortly after jenny and her family die in a plane crash sarah spends the years of her adolescence puzzling over her loss defecting from her present when sarah receives an email in 1995 from a woman in moscow implying that jenny's death may not be what it seems sarah grasps at the alternate reality her attachment to her childhood friend is perplexing even as it is recognizable jenny and sarah were not well matched and the reader resists jenny's attraction but early attachments always carry weight and sarah has had little else to invest in holt addresses the complexities of memory in her text with a light touch playing with the tricks of hindsight and the rewrites that love demands there is a grey sobriety to the tone of holt's novel which makes the moments of brightness sparkle with even more brilliance sarah is a loner but her isolation coheres with the uneasy culture of the reborn russia her ventures into moscow are mediated by expat communities or citizens with hidden agendas living in moscow she continually bumps up against the presentation of the past and the faltering reality of the present the two polishing each other's sides into a lethal edge sarah is a watchful narrator as wary of deception as she is hungry for other possibilities holt subtly adjusts the kilter of her novel's focus the shift unapparent until you find yourself looking steeply downward surprised at the ground you've covered \"you are one of them\" is about perceived and real threat and considers the ways in which your past does and does not shape your future it is about girlhood and friendship but it is also about motherhood and the motherland holt manages these shifting perspectives with the grace of an expert cinematographer bringing larger truths into focus while allowing sarah to linger in moscow in the limbo of the unknown http bookingaround tumblr com post","187":"spoiler one if those annoying books where nothing is revealed in the end felt a little rushed in the last third still an interesting read","188":"is elliott trying to kill me with the latest pages on this book seriously a great reading some interesting points on the cultural aspects about post soviet russia i've just finished a book about a brazilian journalist that lived in russia as a correspondent and their comments about the culture and society were very alike and the writing was really great usually i have the tendency of getting bored with a book with many flashbacks but it didn't happen in this one but just as a final note if you are looking for a suspense thriller do not read this book this one is a drama story about the power of the remembrance reencounters and growing up a great tale set in a great and important moment of our history","189":"this novel is loosely based on the true story of samantha smith who was a child actress and peace advocate during the early 80s i enjoyed the story the author told while using some facts from the real story and weaving her own story around them and changing the names there was good character development here which is always important to me i didn't want to put it down","190":" elliott holt's first novel was just ok not great but an interesting story about a friendship between two young girls the cold war russia and moving on novels by american writers set in russia have proliferated in recent years and i have read quite a few so it is hard not to compare them i'll get my quibbles out of the way sometimes the dates of incidents in the story occurring in the late 1970s and early 1980s felt inaccurate to me i was not following the cold war and fear of atomic annihilation in those years looking back now i can't recall thinking about that stuff after 1969 so i could be wrong i kept comparing this book to a partial history of lost causes holt covers a similar set of descriptions about post communist russia the cold the vodka the smoking the ugliness and the scamming but the emotional depth of her tale does not plunge as far as jennifer dubois did in her novel what i liked was the main character sarah zuckerman and her slow emergence from innocence it is true to me that one can become submerged beneath the personal power of a friend especially at 10 years old and when the inevitable betrayal comes it causes an arrested development in the betrayed one has been a dupe the author accurately portrays such a catastrophe she also writes well and i will read her next novel as she says in the last line i had new stories to tell when it comes to books set in contemporary russia i plan to stick to russian authors in the future","191":"i kept reading and waiting for the good part for me it just did not deliver the goods","192":"this made me think a lot about shifting friendships and it made me want to visit moscow","193":" elliott holt did an interview with the millions as well this makes me wish every book had author explanations for the choices in cover and plot which helps with my comprehension of the novel http www themillions com 2013 09 th to add a little more intrigue the blog talking covers just posted the author designer and photographer's thought on the cover of the hardback excellent http talkingcovers com 2013 07 23 y goes right along with my obsession of the americans tv show the closing pages also really resonated with me having lost friends along the way that were tough to let go","194":" good but not great from the synopsis i was really expecting this to be more of a mystery filled with cold war intrigue but it was not the plot kind of just inches along with no real conflict or thrill the central mystery is indeed eventually revealed but with no fanfare and you'd basically already figured it out awhile ago anyway the parts of the story that focused on post soviet union russia in the mid 90s were the most interesting and from reading other reviews it seems like the author gave a realistic interpretation of what it was like there at the time this was a fast and enjoyable read but definitely not what i was expecting","195":" wonderful book it's especially poignant if you grew up during the cold war the main character was 8 years old when reagan became president in 1980 and so was i she captured succinctly the fears i had as a child and adolescent that the soviet union could annihilate us at any moment i don't want to describe too much because it's the kind of book it would be especially satisfying to stumble into without much back story it is full of friendship mystery and coming of age nostalgia all ingredients for a great book as far as i'm concerned highly recommended","196":"i think i liked the idea of the book better than the book itself always a sucker for the spy novels just didn't carry much suspense","197":"one of the most satisfying ambiguous endings i can recall holt masterfully weaves cold war history into a suspenseful novel about a woman experiencing her own perestroika","198":"i really enjoyed this book the cold war growing up in the 80's the middle of the book was a little slow and depressing it could have been that the setting was in moscow in the middle of the book i loved the ending my favorite line from the book was maybe you think you can destroy us but that is not true we can destroy ourselves","199":" i bought this book at the mysterious bookshop in new york so i expected it to be a little bit more a mystery than it turned out to be there are elements of mystery as the apparent main story question is what sarah will learn about the death or perhaps survival of her childhood best friend jenny both girls write letters during the cold war to yuri andropov in the hope of helping relations between the two countries only jenny's letter is published and she gets to take a trip to the soviet union and becomes a media darling later she and her parents are killed in a plane crash or are they the book moves effortlessly between the changes in the relationship between the two girls and the adult sarah living in russia after receiving a mysterious letter suggesting her friend may be alive i identified with quite a bit of this book from having had a friendship much like sarah's and jenny's to having a mother very concerned about the danger posed by the soviet union to having traveled to a former soviet country roughly around the time sarah does in the book one reviewer commented on how critical sarah is of russia i suppose that's true but for all that she describes many unpleasant aspects of life there i found that part of the book compelling so much so that i'm thinking about visiting there in the next few years for writers this is a great book to read as an example of shifting between time periods in a character's life as well as in the political historical backdrop of the story it's also a good example of how an external plot question what happened to jenny reflects the narrator's interior conflict because ultimately i felt the story was more about sarah's internal conflicts that the mystery i understand why some readers' reviews reflect disappointment that the book wasn't as much of suspense mystery story as anticipated but for me it was definitely a 5 star book","200":"this is one of those first novels that promises better things to come on its own it's decent but not earth shaking you are one of them begins with an actual piece of cold war history a 10 year old girl named samantha smith in real life writes a letter to soviet general secretary yuri andropov in 1982 asking for peace he answers and invites her to visit the ussr she becomes a media sensation but tragically dies in a plane crash a few years later in this fictional version the celebrity is jennifer jones and our narrator is her best friend sarah zuckerman who also writes a letter but doesn't get a response the first third of the book mostly focuses on sarah and jenny's childhood relationship but the bulk of the story is set ten years later when sarah gets a letter suggesting jenny didn't really die and travels to moscow to look for the truth some of the early publicity pegged this book as a mystery or a thriller but to my relief it's more literary fiction than either it lacks the relentless speed of a thriller or the tidy structure of a mystery and readers looking for either will likely be disappointed instead it's an intelligently written novel about lost friendship and about the cold war and its aftermath the global and the personal are inextricable here the writing style is polished and lacking in fluff and the pacing is smooth the structure is maybe a bit lopsided spending what feels like a long time on the childhood friendship before we get to the meat of the story those scenes might have worked better interspersed with the moscow chapters but this is a quick read and kept me interested throughout even the ambiguous ending worked for me though it might not for a mystery reader the character development is mixed and this is one area i expect to holt improve in future books sarah's narrative voice is strong and distinct and gives the reader a clear picture of who she is on the inside but the actual scenes do little to throw her personality into relief so for instance we see a lot of her loneliness and feeling that everyone abandons her and her intelligence and self consciousness come through clearly but she simply tells us that she has trouble making friends because she's too melancholy and complex we don't actually see anything to support that meanwhile there are some good moments with the supporting cast sarah's mother in particular is vividly drawn but for the most part while they're not flat they are forgettable even jenny never quite came together for me the development of the setting is interesting though and the author's time as an expat in russia comes through clearly in the end a decent book although not a great one but the writing is strong enough that i will be interested in holt's next effort with better characterization it could be excellent","201":"i enjoyed this book and look forward to more by this author","202":"you are one of them is easy to read and plot is as good as it can be considering that it is based on a real story of samantha smith jennifer jones in the novel for those of us who saw the end of the cold war era and demise of the soviet union some stories in the novel are pretty familiar it is a relatively short book and would make a pleasant read on an overseas flight","203":" from kalireads com the americans with russian girlfriends-\"pillow dictionaries \" they called them aware that these lanky mysterious women were far better looking than anyone they'd touched back home-began to sound like natives they were peacocks preening with slang...a little bravado goes a long way toward hiding the loneliness you can reinvent yourself with a different alphabet -- elliott holt you are one of themyou are one of them by elliott holt is a love song of a book a love song to foreign lands that always seem impossibly perfect until you get there a love song to a different time when we were younger and everything around us looked so much bigger a love song to the beliefs we have when we are children and the hope that we can grasp tightly onto even as adults narrator sarah had a best friend growing up a perfect best friend named jennifer jones they grew up in washington d c together during the paranoid madness of the cold war sarah's mom is neurotic charting nuclear fallout on huge maps spread along the dining table while jennifer's parents are so idyllic they seem quaint the girls write letters to the soviet union asking for peace and suddenly jennifer jones just jennifer jones not sarah is famous her letter has been published in the soviet papers and answered by their president they've asked her to come to the ussr as an ambassador of sorts as sarah watches from home jennifer is made america's darling and as sarah watches from home jennifer and her parents crash into the ocean on a small plane never to be seen again then years later sarah receives a mysterious e mail from russia a woman who knew jennifer as a child who hosted her when she visited asks \"would sarah come doesn't she have questions \" she will and she does sarah packs up and is off to russia searching for a truth she isn't sure exists regarding her long lost friend jennifer if there is a strong point in holt's writing it is paralleling the disorienting experience of childhood with the disorienting experience of wandering a new country alone in both situations sarah seems totally lost and at the mercy of those around her almost adrift in a sea of people she needs to lean on but may not be able to trust in the best way possible you are one of them reminded me of the gardens of kyoto by kate walbert one of my favorite books when i was younger both books very much have this \"let me sit you down and tell you what i do and what i do not know about my past\" feel to the narration which creates a feel of unraveling a web of dark secrets and drama with the narrator as they explore their own memories","204":" i have to start by acknowledging that i am married to svetlana romanova that is the real life version of this character samantha smith's friend natasha she is the other girl on the cover of samantha's book the one heavily referenced in the novel in fact we're coming up on our 24 year anniversary next month i suppose that this makes me a little biased but it also gives me an unusual perspective naturally i was very excited to read this book i understood that it was fantasy that was based on actual events that took place in 1983 when samantha and my wife met in artec and began a friendship that lasted until samantha's death in 1985 so of course i wasn't expecting a historic account but i was still hoping for something insightful and interesting unfortunately i found the characters in the book especially the russians to be flat one dimensional caricatures they're all damaged deceitful and want to exploit poor sarah the eternal victim really i happen to read quite a bit and i have a difficult time remembering when i last came across a novel with no characters that i liked or wanted to get to know better after reading that the author elliott holt had spent time in moscow i feel a little sad that this is all that she took away from that experience i think that her protagonist sarah is supposed to stand in contrast to all of the self centered dishonest people that she comes across in her life friends lovers acquaintances however i think that it is sarah who is most self centered dishonest and even jealous and delusional i'm giving the book 2 stars because it at least brings some attention to samantha smith and the events that occurred in 1983 as far as getting to know russia her people her culture etc this book is extremely superficial and devoid of substance i suspect that samantha smith would have agreed","205":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here so i really did have high hopes for this book college graduate

talked more there it just was this huge buildup to such a letdown overall not a bad book but i wish there was more time to finish it more","206":"didn't even realize until it was over that this is loosely based on actual events great story especially after reading the bronze horseman trilogy","207":" in 1982 nine year olds sarah and jenny write letters to andropov asking him to not start a nuclear war jenny's letter receives a reply and an invitation for her to visit russia while sarah is left behind in 1985 jenny and her family are killed in a plane crash but was it really an accident ten years later just as sarah is about to graduate from college she receives a mysterious letter from a young woman in moscow who suggests that jenny may not have died in the crash sarah travels to russia to look for answers but finds that truth is a slippery thing to pin down what is truth and what is propaganda in either country did neil armstrong walk on the moon did jenny die in a plane crash can sarah believe anything she's ever been told as she gets deeper into the mystery of her lost friend she must reevaluate her past and her reactions to the main events in her life this is a beautifully told story of friendship and loss and how far someone will go to find a lost love it is also a gripping mystery that will keep you wondering","208":"this book was recommended because i watch a very good tv series called the americans this book was just ok neither fascinating nor boring but somewhere in between","209":"i am surprised by the negative reviews on goodreads i thought this was an engrossing well written first novel that kept me eagerly turning the pages looking forward to her next book","210":"this is a lot of research and no character development in a nutshell the synopsis had 'me' written all over it but on the whole the book fell flat we were told the main character had grown but didn't ever get to know her well enough to actually experience or care about that growth lacking in dimension and so rather plain and forgettable","211":"good quick read captivating decently paced and interesting plot makes for a great page turner","212":"i just recently finished this book and i enjoyed it i was surprised by the ending however it did not disappoint me i recommend this book","213":"found this on the shelf of friends at the san pedro public library quick read without any exploring about the author thought elliott was a guy had just finished several stories set in dc with the spooks fbi and oga the russian lessons were helpful as i have several neighbors from moscow and i can not ever remember anything they try to teach me but they have successfully taught my dog to speak russian very good reading","214":"the book started so great that i thought it would be a favorite but the 2nd part was too slow to qualify sarah is a child from a broken home who desperately needs the friendship of jennifer who moves in across the street but when jennifer becomes a celebrity after writing to the russian premier for peace sarah is left behind jennifer and her parents are killed in a plane accident but when sarah is grown she has reason to believe jennifer is living in russia she travels there is search of her friend sarah is a troubled individual in the making as you read on","215":"loved it i've been reading about the cold war ever since","216":"this is another of my top picks for 2013 it turns the memory of love mixed with subtle rivalry between two childhood friends into a driving obsession the urges the story on through dangerous territories these territories are both internal and external for the main character a young woman whose inferiority complex is deepened and explored as she plunges into a life in late twentieth century moscow braving conmen and disillusionment as she searches for a woman who may no longer be living","217":"actually a 2 5 the buildup and the story line was far more interesting than the resolution","218":" coming of age since the cold war efforts to integrate events of a sad childhood in washington dc eventually resulting in the narrator taking initiative to resolve her hurt feelings related to too many abandonments and behave actively in her own interests not as satisfying an ending as i wished for since the ambiguity she started with remains ain't that a bitch lovely writing in places certainly good enough to read through to the end but without many of the same kinds of memories and fears from the cold war resonance falls short for me","219":"a woman visits russia to find her friend who died in a plane crash the story involves a great deal of adolescent anxiety","220":"i really enjoy red this book enjoyed the way it ended the characters were well done just a great book","221":"i wasn't expecting to like this book it's not my usual tastes elliott holt however did such a fantastic job shaping her characters and the world in which they exist that i couldn't help but get sucked in i think the strongest aspect of the book is holt's writing style the language she uses twists and turns the reader like the truths and lies passed between the cia and kgb at the height of this novel's time period she effortlessly leads us through meandering tourist days and anxious nights spent worrying at the prospect of a friend not quite dead","222":"great read about female friendship with a nice russian spy twist","223":" i'll start by saying overall i liked the book it was a fast read engaging from the very start i thought the author did a great job in detailing the character's visit to russia authentically i assume portraying a vivid description with interesting detail i read this rather quickly too speaking to the fact that it was a real page turner the biggest disappointment i have is the ending while the ending satisfied the main character it did not satisfy me it was a real let down to not have definitive answers and i thought this was rather unfair to the reader who had invested her emotion time in the story and the characters overall nice creative book though","224":"good story enjoyed reading it even the ending shocked to learn that this was taken from a true event","225":"i had a lot of hope for this book but it was very disappointing","226":"i enjoyed this book at first i wasn't sure it would hold my interest but in short order i was hooked","227":" this novel is based on samantha smith from the 80s the girl who wrote a letter to andropov of the soviet union with her concerns for nuclear war the two main characters in this book do not include samantha but is told through the eyes of sarah her friend about her friend jenny who travels as a celebrity to moscow and a guest of the soviet government but returns with her parents only to die in a plane crash later this is what happened to the real samantha smith in this story as an adult sarah travels to russia looking for her friend years later was the plane crash a hoax is her friend still alive great descriptions of life in russia in the post soviet years of the 1990s","228":" the beginning of the novel that follows jenny and sarah's friendship was great but everything after that felt muddled and uninteresting the idea that jenny was possibly a defector was an intriguing one but it's like the author didn't know where to go with it at all the story felt so bogged down and tedious once sarah went to russia and the quick few pages of exposition to end what the entire novel had been striving to answer was a major letdown there were also some beats that didn't make sense the characters in russia existed as caricatures of real people and the random references to sarah's failed relationships in the future felt completely out of place i wish the writer had been able to keep the momentum both stylistically and narratively that she had for the first part of the novel because that would've been a much better book than whatever this turned out to be","229":"a very enjoyable intriguing novel pulls you in and you don't want to stop until you know the truth if it is the truth i look forward to future works by this author","230":"i really enjoyed reading you are one of them by elliott holt having grown up during the cold war i could identify well with the main character sarah zuckerman from whose point of view the book is written so many cultural references to that time in history reminded me of elementary school and middle school when there was a definite fear amongst children my age about what the cold war would bring to our lives i remember seeing signs for the fall out shelters and the constant coverage of the nuclear arms race and subsequent nuclear disarmament in conveying the story of sarah and jenny jones holt does an amazing job of describing each character in a way that as a reader i felt that i could have been friends with them i tended to be more like sarah during elementary school and middle school but i knew girls like sarah who were like the sun drawing everyone into their universe you are one of them is a wonderful and gripping read that i would highly recommend to anyone who grew up during this time in our history","231":"pretty bleak and debbie downer from beginning to end i still liked it but it won't be for everyone","232":"while the plot is a tad predictable holt's spot on descriptions of moscow in the mid 90s the wild wild east made this debut novel a fun nostalgic read for me","233":"ooohhh this is a good book a bit mystery a bit 1980s cold war fear a bit learn something about russia very good and it leaves you thinking what if the story is about two good friends sarah and jenny growing up in an upscale area of washington dc during the cold war fear days a letter is written to soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace jenny the all american girl is chosen along with her family to go to russia in a demonstration of peace between the two countries along the way jenny changes the friendship falls by the wayside and sarah wonders what if definitely a must read you won't be able to put it down","234":"this is a quick and engaging read set in the 1980s and mid 1990s so i could easily relate to the cultural references since i am about the age of the protagonist i loved the first few lines and am not sure the rest of the book lived up to their promise but i liked it nonetheless two best friends neighbors in washington d c write letters to yuri andropov to ask him not to bomb the u s one of the fathers offers to mail them and it turns out that one girl's letter gets through yuri writes back and offers her a two week tour of russia so she can see that they are good people too the friendship between the two girls disintegrates after that and the protagonist is left wondering about their relationship long into her 20s when she goes to russia in an attempt to finally puzzle it out","235":"excellent debut by a wonderful family friend go read it","236":"good story interesting read 1980's and 1990's tale of america vs ussr childhood friendship plane crash and spies and an adult visit to moscow led on by a friend of a friend hummm kept me guessing until the very last page good read","237":"was it easy to relate to the main character in you are one of them because i have similarities to sarah zuckerman or because elliott holt has a way of writing a character so that she is relatable to everyone i don't know but i think that's how you can tell that an author is great at characterization i didn't just feel like i knew sarah i felt like i understood her this book had lots of things i enjoy cold war era russia well defined and interesting characters mystery though not in that whodunnit kind of way i'm willing to bet there are those that dislike the ending but i think it ends as it should","238":"a little slow in the middle but interesting nonetheless","239":"well researched but the mood of the book and voice of the narrator is flat and bleak","240":"and sarah's mother tells her people believe in things until they don't need to anymore this quote from the novel is resonating with me","241":"so good on vacation and on husband's iphone at the moment so will write review later but such a good book","242":" an interesting look at lingering cold war paranoia and how it colors a young girl's coming of age normally when one adolescent girl betrays another it is usually over a boy not a country but in holt's novel jenny abandonmnet of sarah is preceiptated by jenny's letter to yuri andropov and the ensuing media spotlight that shines upon her when jenny dies in a place crash her emotional withdrawal defection from sarah is complete or is it when sarah goes to russia to walk in jenny's shoes she begins to buy into the paranoic culture that svetlana jenny's guide on her original tour of russia introduces her to really compleiing all the way until the end","243":"i liked this quite a bit until i got to the ambiguous ending stylistically i can certainly understand why holt went that way and i'll even go so far as to admit that it was the right choice but i've just never been a fan of ambiguous endings particularly in stories with as much mystery as this one","244":"i had high hopes but the book didn't live up to them i had a hard time really connecting with the protagonist and i kept on waiting for the book to start rather than simply to summarize what had happened there were some nice moments but there wasn't enough meat overall","245":" i really wanted to like this book for some reason i just did not connect with either the story or the main character in theory this book should have interested me more than it did a period of the cold war i'm unfamiliar with i've heard of the defectors and the re defectors and the spies everywhere but not enough not from the 80s i also was brought up in india where if the cold war touched us i was blissfully unaware of it but this book while it's perked up my enthusiasm for this period was not engaging this is the one time i was wishing this was a straight mystery and not literary fiction i could have done with some tight plotting and swift pace","246":"i really rate this book a 2 5 although the setting and storyline are very good depictions of actual time and place i did not like the character sarah much and thought her naive and the part of the story line that takes pace in russia weak perhaps this was written for young readers","247":"really a 3 75 loved all the 80s details but it got a little weird with the chronology i can't figure out if it was the flashback aspect or the actual wording and the ending not my fav","248":"certainly not what i was expecting cold war russia 80's insight i definitely felt like holt did her homework and kept my attention","249":"at first this was interesting but then it got very slow","250":"4 5 really interesting story","251":"i took down my original review because it was negative and the first one posted and ms holt is active on goodreads and i didn't want to be a jerk but in the context of several glowing reviews i'll restate that this novel did not work for me despite the often beautiful writing it reads like a location in search of a plot the one and only question is what really happened to jenny who died in a plane crash years ago the answer unfolds like a nancy drew mystery","252":"very intriguing story with a very interesting story line well written and fully developed main character who you genuinly care about","253":"it was very different russians inthe 50's and two friends i guess we never know who someone is especially when you are ten","254":"she nailed the growing up during the time period good story","255":"so good a fun but sophisticated story of two girls who were friends during the cold war 80s but not all is as it seems read it and we can talk about who jenny jones was in the end","256":"this was a tough read not because it was emotional or heartbreaking but because i found it very dull and anti climactic and had to force myself to finish it i felt like i was reading a junior spy novel though not a good one not for me","257":" i enjoyed this book because it had a good writing style and i cared about sara and all her fragility however jennifer was so unlikable as a character that i didn't care if sara ever found her again also the book was just over so quickly i found myself wondering what got edited out in the end i wanted to know more about sara and where she went with her mother and father plot wise sadly we never got there in the story just 3 stars for this one cutting some slack because it was a debut novel","258":" i enjoyed this book but i wanted to like it a lot more than i did it seemed to be a combination of many things i love and as a copywriter i was interested in seeing elliott holt's transition into a very different format many people assume most copywriters are failed or aspiring novelists working on their manuscripts by night but the kind of writing demanded by each profession is vastly different it's definitely evident that this is a first novel because at times it feels very much as if it's staying on the surface level the characters were stereotypical and although i read the book quickly i didn't feel as if i knew them very well the writing is beautiful and straightforward which i enjoyed and which made it a very quick read but at times it was overly simplistic and i wanted to delve more into the characters' motivations and emotions the story is strongest at the beginning when it builds a beautiful tale of a growing friendship between two young girls who create a sense of safety during a time of uncertainty with each other because the young friendship between the two girls is the backdrop and undercurrent throughout the entire book it does give the story a hint of young adult historical fiction which is a genre i really loved i think that's why i expected to like this book a lot more than i did to be honest i was much more interested in jenny's life as a defector in russia and her transition into a life of hiding there rather than in sarah's quest to find her the russian characters svetlana and andrei seemed almost like throwaways and the plot points that svetlana advanced ended a little too abruptly most of the reason i gave the book three stars was because the parts when svetlana led sarah on tours around moscow giving her opinions on american and russian cultures were really well done and wryly written these characters became the most interesting for me because their analysis of american culture and its impact on post cold war russia could have been further explored especially with the goldmine of a setting that was a post cold war russian advertising agency there was so much to be done there and i wished i would have gotten more the writing about moscow and the creation of the place and time there is some of the most beautiful and promising writing in the book i enjoyed the ambiguous ending and the gradual buildup to a quick reveal which seemed to mimic the way sara was able to gradually let jenny go so she could grow up on her own but still the final quarter of the book was rushed in a way that didn't necessarily make it feel natural it was almost as if the author didn't know what to do once she'd revealed the truth about jenny i'll definitely be eager to see more from elliott holt but perhaps because of the huge buildup for this book i couldn't help but feel a little unfulfilled","259":"great writing weak plot not dissatisfied but not thrilled either","260":"some people have classified this as a mystery i think if you are expecting a mystery you will disappointed in this book i personally enjoyed it but found it more like a combination of the true story of samantha smith the american girl who did visit russia after writing a letter and later died in a plane crash and the tv show the americans there was lots of intrigue but not a lot of mystery if that makes any sense good story that brought me back to my childhood in both good and bad ways","261":" i really enjoyed reading this book the hope of a mystery to be solved inticed me to read this story but what it revealed was so much more rewarding sarah loses her childhood friend jenny in a plane crash during a flight back to the usa from russia during the cold war era as she was a good will ambassador of sorts after her death journalists u0026amp talk show pundits put forth conspiracy theories about her death being staged ordered etc but none of those theories was ever proved and the causes of her plane crash remained shrouded in mystery after graduating from college sarah recieves an email from svetlana a russian girl who accompanied jenny on her travels through the soviet union she urges sarah to come to russia she intimates that perhaps jenny is not dead sarah and jenny had drifted apart for various reasons when jenny began her visits to russia but jenny is the one that drifted away for sarah that drifting was painful and jenny 's everyday presence in her life was sorely missed so she makes the journey to russia in the hopes of finding her friend or perhaps proof of what really happened to her so that she can experience closure i think what frustrates alot of readers with this book is that after all is said and done there is no definitive proof of what happened to jenny what svetlana offers sarah for proof is no more than half truths with smoke and mirrors thrown in she could be a writer for the history channel's show 'ancient aliens' anyway if you wanted a story with it's mystery all tied up and explained you've missed the point of this book entirely and you will be very frustrated with life the point of this story is there are truths you will never know for a variety of reasons and it's usually because the parties involved don't know the truth themselves or because they don't want you or anyone else to know if you think everything you read in the paper on the internet or in celebrity magazines is true you are sadly mistaken and that is why people from other countries don't respect americans as a whole we are singularly very naive when it comes to believing what we read in our national newspapers and what we see and hear on our national news shows and that includes our staunch belief that we can find the truth in any mystery some truths will never be discovered i'm sad to say sarah finally realises this i think and perhaps at the same time realises that she was looking for someone and something that no longer existed svetlana could be telling her the truth about jenny and she could be lying but sarah decides to walk away from the whole situation because it no longer matters during her search for jenny she is finally able to let go of what once was and walk away into a future and that was the heart of this story perhaps we mold and shape people and situations with our own hopes and expectations we fill in their unknown qualities with our own suppositions about what motivates them according to what they say and do or don't say or do when we finally see them for who they really are we are surprised but given time we see that we are finally able to understand the person without our hopes and expectations superimposed on their actions if we keep these truths in mind we can save ourselves alot of anguish guilt and self loathing anyway that's what i gleaned from this wonderful story but read it for yourself there is so much more to be enjoyed from it's pages you won't be disappointed","262":"the writing in this book was beautiful the story was compelling the ambiguity of the ending was frustrating but overall i really enjoyed it","263":"if this was supposed to be a mystery i didn't get that it felt more like a story about a person discovering that they can stand on their own feet instead of a mystery and i liked it that way it was an interesting change from fx's the americans where you know they're spies and they start out that way where as it seems the spy in this one just sort of fell into the job","264":"i won this book in a contest hosted by bookpage com you are one of them a debut novel by elliot holt was fantastic the writer takes the reader from 1980's washington to russia in the 90's via a well written and enjoyable story i liked the main character immensely although i wasn't sure why she was wasting her time with her supposed best friend jenny who seemed a little self involved and bossy to me but the story was great i'll be following this author and reading her subsequent books","265":"it's been ages maybe 10 or so years since i've read a novel set around the cold war and boy this was a great way to break the fast holt is an excellent writer of characters and internal conflicts she is great at writing about dirty cities and nuclear fears in a way that makes you think 'what if i was there what would i do ' the ending is as many have bemoaned completely open ended no mystery is solved and i think that's where my only disappointment lies i love mysteries and i feel like 'you are one of them' started out in an entanglement of puzzles but by midway through completely dropped them all i wanted to read more about the plane crash how sarah felt when she heard how her life changed holt gives us glimpses of what happened but that isn't enough to satiate my thirst for information russia moscow cold war fear five stars unresolved mysteries minus a million","266":" this was a well written book i enjoyed it its look back into the 1980s was poignant and well done when the heroine spent time in moscow the descriptions of life as she saw it fears due to ongoing distrust in soviet u s relations and explorations of the russian language kept my interest but i was let down by the ending and wanted to know what really happened to jenny did she die in a plane crash years ago or was she now living in russia the writer left it to the reader to infer an answer to this question but i would have preferred a more resolute ending","267":" this is a well written and easy to read book my biggest problem was that i didn't understand the motive of the protagonist which made the story feel a bit unnecessary on the whole i was glad that it was so easy to read that when i was finished i did not feel it was a waste there was no effort involved in finishing thanks to the authors prose but you could tell it was a male author trying to write from a female view and most unfortunate it fed into my preconceived notions of russia and reaffirmed my desire to not travel to that country as if global news was not enough i am not even sure if the author has been there still it was an interesting take on growing up and living with the idea of the cold war which is not a subject i run into often","268":"started off strong with both plot and characters but quickly became predictable the ending was weak i felt like the story wasn't properly wrapped up nor was there really much of a climax maybe because i went in expecting more of a mystery i ended up disappointed","269":"i loved parts of this book the sections of the story that talked about sarah and her friendship with jenny spoke to me and i loved the writing of it with the kgb stuff i wasn't so into i actually skipped to the end just to see what happens i did like the main character and was with her on her journey and with that the author did a good job to keep me invested in what happens to her all in all it was an interesting book but not one of my favorites","270":"set around a cold war childhood concerning a woman still grappling with the potential betrayal and loss of her childhood friend the novel is well written and sprinkled with interesting characterizations and comments about the history of the nuclear era","271":" i kept second guessing that this book was maybe a young adult book but finally decided it wasn't i wasn't in love with the narrator i kept thinking she would get better of course maybe that was the point she was an anxious kid quiet not super popular etc etc or the book would go a totally other way and she'd end up psycho obsessed with this idea of jenny and it would be a whole other book but that wasn't the book she was obsessed with jenny for sure and everyone else that 'left' her but sigh it was boring even the climax was not much of one i did appreciate the cold war reminders and the history thrown in there i would read it if i were you no not some of you and tell me where i overthought it","272":"best friends at ten years old sarah and jenny are inseparable friends and neighbors in washington d c it is the 1980's and the berlin wall is soon to come down sarah's english father has abandoned them and her mother is obsessed with nuclear disarmament and the cold war she is agoraphobic and although she is the adult in the household sarah is often the caretaker jenny's home is wholesome as apple pie her perfect parents welcome sarah into their lives as she spends most of her time there the girls decide to write letters to yuri andropov in the soviet union asking for peace jenny's letter gets printed in the newspaper and it launches her into a crazy 5 minutes of fame that turns into two years of trips reporters and interviews with jenny as the poster child for peace flash forward ten years later and sarah has graduated college she is in search of jenny of her own identity and does everything in her power to lead a life different from her housebound mother's sarah journeys to russia as her past and present collide teaching her the truth about the world and herself incredibly unique storyline from this novelist the author shows the reader how to delve deep into the imagination but also back to a time of great change in the world it is about friendship family truth and like all juicy stories betrayal highly recommend","273":" mild spoilers holt is a very mature disciplined writer she ends paragraphs beautifully without any of that extra debut novel flab one so often finds her central metaphor that of political defection as a kind of personal rejection is an incredibly powerful one in that it makes both defection feel deeply stingingly personal and romantic friend rejection feel epic world ending d c in the cold war is a great setting one too little used in contemporary fiction and holt deploys it with skill and texture it should be said that this is a deeply lonely story the main character was left by both a deceased sister and a divorced father early in her life and as such struggles mightily to make connections to other characters holt even prevents the reader from assuming a happier future for the narrator cutting off a potential romance and describing a future heartbreak there's a brutal truth to this and it's never written in a heavy handed way but the loneliness is deep and pervasive","274":" this book has stayed with me and a few days after finishing it i find myself thinking about it i really enjoyed the author's style and her skill at creating a sense of place the plot two girls write letters to soviet premier andropov in the early 1980s one is chosen to visit the ussr and becomes a minor celebrity before dying in a plane crash and the surviving girl visits russia in the 1990s after the fall of communism and investigates whether her friend's death was a hoax seemed both improbable and realistic at the same time readers of spy fiction will be impatient with this character centric novel but readers of smart readable literary fiction will be entertained between this and the tv show the americans it is an interesting pop culture time for 1980s us soviet spy stories","275":"little known facts about me in high school i sang in a choir called peace child which featured earnest songs like mister president about the threat of nuclear war and the hopes for peace and i spent a month at world peace camp in portland maine which was named in honor of samantha smith camping alongside other children from around the world and working toward peace and cross cultural understanding i started college as an international relations major with hopes of studying russian and economics until i realized i had zero natural talents in either russian nor economics changed majors and packed away my peace child dreams so perhaps it's for sentimental reasons that i rated this book so highly all of the cold war details as seen and experienced by a narrator just a few years older than me brought me right smack back into a lot of my childhood hopes and fears the book itself captured my interest and i read it quickly but probably because of the time and place more than the story or characters themselves a good book made great by my own memories","276":"i picked this book up because i needed something and it was the only thing available that sounded interesting while i liked the cold war history the storyline was only okay there were several times during dialog where i was distracted by the constant repeat of i said he said she said then i said again and again overall meh","277":"i really liked this book the audio book kept my attention i'm still trying to figure out if i am ok with how the book ended i wanted more but understand that what i wanted to know in the end doesn't really matter or change the way sarah feels such a good book","278":"loved the ending","279":"i loved it couldn't put it down good moments of wit with a deep deep soul i want to put it your hands now","280":"didn't love this book as much as i expected to after reading some of her essays her descriptions of post glasnost russia were very interesting and her writing of the disintigration of middle school girl friendship was also quite on point","281":"interesting book but it was a little too melancholic for me","282":"i was undecided on how to rate this one the story and the characters really didn't hold my attention but the writing was beautiful and evocative","283":"good amount of mystery and suspense great descriptions of 1995 moscow i wanted more character development especially of the protagonist the flash forwards to her adult life were distracting rather than helpful to the plot or her character","284":"enjoyed the 1980s dc references","285":"if you're expecting a mystery this book will disappoint another reviewer compared this novel to a nancy drew story but i have to vehemently disagree there are no clues leading to the truth here no revelations no suspects no red herrings this isn't a who done it story at all sarah is a baby when her older sister dies an event that breaks her parents and creates an eternal absence in her life a few years later her father leaves washington dc and returns to london sarah's mom doesn't leave the house much she's too busy worrying about nuclear war this is the 80s after all the cold war era and it's also when sarah meets charming outgoing jenny who moves in across the street and becomes sarah's bff the two girls are inseparable until at age 12 jenny is suddenly thrust into the spotlight as a child ambassador to the soviet union when her letter to a russian leader is published in a russian newspaper and picked up by the u s media following her stint as celebrity jenny is invited to various speaking engagements as she's flying to one of these her parents in tow tragedy strikes jenny's plane goes down and everyone on board dies or so believes sarah until everything she thought she knew is turned upsidedown by a mysterious letter she receives when she's 22 and about to graduate from college the letter from a woman named svetlana who was jenny's russian buddy during jenny's visit to the ussr prompts sarah to visit the former soviet union where she has to question her own loyalty to the jenny she once knew and to a version of the story she's carefully constructed the novel takes us to the newly democratic soviet union in the mid 90s and gives us a brief lesson in russian culture as a child of the former soviet bloc who moved to the states in the 80s i could relate to the time and place holt expertly weaves in russian phrases and paints a picture of a country on the brink of an economic explosion whose people are used to espionage and secrets the story focuses on a friendship between two very different girls withdrawn lonely sarah is dependent on jenny and her near obsession with jenny persists into adulthood never mind that their relationship changes after jenny visits the soviet union because jenny dies young sarah responds to the memory of what was vs jenny the actual person few childhood friendships survive intact and memories of those friendships are often idealized and filtered through the innocence of childhood sometimes things make sense only in reverse when we have the perspective of our adult selves the adult sarah is asked to confront an alternate reality a possibility that jenny is alive but is she being duped does her desire to see jenny once again taint her perception in holt's novel there is no truth only stories we tell ourselves the ambiguity of the ending can be maddening until we realize that it's precisely the point truth is ambiguous really there is no truth only versions of it and we decide which version we choose to believe","286":"you are one of them reaches the confused paranoia that it aspires to plot wise but thematically as well caused by and a mimicry of cold war attitudes but only for about a third of the book where it is bookended by a ho hum beginning and an end that somehow ties everything together too nicely while remaining ambiguous worth reading for the 70 or so pages that feel carved out of hitchcock or raymond chandler but not something i can throw the full force of my recommendation behind","287":"i found this book fascinating both in its plot and in its detailed descriptions of moscow the writing was beautiful and precise and holt captured all of the pain of broken relationships the ones that fade the ones that break and the ones that die well written and compelling","288":" good but not great another book with a lot of hype which even compared the author holt to alice munro not sure if i agree i admire the author's knowledge of moscow and the cold war and the way she weaves it effortlessly into the novel and unlike other reviewers i enjoyed the ambiguous not so neat and tidy ending for me though there were too many loose ends why no other mention of sarah's father or izzy what happens with svetla and the new job in russia and the romantic relationship s she alludes to in the last 20 pp or so come from out of the blue leaving me as a reader unprepared i like dual story lines but i thought the narrative in this case between the early 1980's and mid 1990's was sloppily executed and unbalanced rhonda filipan","289":"currently very interested in this time period so probably enjoyed it a bit more because of that the descriptions of two young girls during the early 80s also resonated with me","290":"very quick engaging read realistically depicts the underlying jealousies secrets and misunderstandings that occur in any friendship the cold war setting and spy themes give it a menacing but compelling edge","291":"this was well written but a little too limp for me overall it won't knock your socks off but it does make some interesting observations and connections across american culture in the 80s and 90s still the novel itself is like the main character kind of sad and gray and hard to put your finger on it certainly does not make me want to visit moscow","292":"i am young enough that i don't remember the cold war i was five when the berlin wall came down six when the soviet union broke up and while i have vague memories of those events on the news i definitely had no idea what the hell it meant the day after the olympic boycotts star wars - all of that happened just enough before my cognitive processes were solidified that i have no real concept of the paranoia and fear that accompanied them i sure as hell had never heard of samantha smith the young girl whose letter to yuri andropov created a media sensation in 1983 smith asked andropov not to engage the united states in nuclear war and andropov invited her to visit russia after the visit she spent a few years promoting peace before she was killed in a 1985 plane crash elliott holt uses smith's story as inspiration for her book you are one of them sarah zuckerman's lived in the shadow of loss her entire life her four year old sister died suddenly of meningitis when sarah was an infant a few years later sarah's father decided to return home to his native england leaving sarah behind with a mother whose agoraphobia anxiety and fear of nuclear war was overwhelming to the point of pathological then when sarah is nine jenny jones moves in next door the two are instantly the best of friends and spend the next few years doing everything together - including writing letters to russia premier yuri andropov asking for peace despite the fact that the letters were sarah's idea jenny's letter is the one published in russia and the one that andropov responds to before sarah has any idea what's going on her best friend is off to russia and becomes a celebrity after her return jenny is invited to do television and media interviews and even gets to write a book about her experience - and none of the publicity mentions sarah sarah is naturally jealous and that combined with normal adolescent mood swings leads to tension in the girls' friendship which remains cold until jenny and her parents are killed in a plane crash when the girls are twelve ten years later sarah is a recent college graduate trying to decide what her next step should be when she receives an email from svetlana jenny's escort during her trip to russia suggesting that jenny may not have died after all intrigued sarah heads to moscow to find out what really happened to her best friend this book was fascinating to me i didn't know that it was loosely based upon actual events when i picked it up so i was enthralled at the originality of the plot it was unlike anything i'd ever read and cold war novels are not particularly common now that we're more afraid of al qaeda than russia even after i read up on samantha smith i was fascinated i mean i devoured this book in a little more than twenty four hours because i just could not stop reading it falls somewhere between a spy thriller and a coming of age novel with a little literary flair it doesn't hurt that holt's prose and construction is amazing sarah's psychological state was very well developed and consistent i felt everything her character felt and i just wanted to reach into the pages and hug her the book is woven with threads of paranoia and loneliness uncertainty and insecurity the layers of metaphors were laid down with finesse and subtlety - i definitely feel like i could pick apart holt's sentences and mine them for meaning and enjoy myself doing so but it never felt like i was getting hit in the face with symbolism it was just so so good go read it","293":"one of the best books i've read in a long time deftly handled sensitively written without being melancholy and a fine plot","294":" anyone who came of age during the cold war years remembers it as a particularly haunting time when the threat of nuclear annihilation was omnipresent and fears - even paranoia - were intensified elliott holt mines this fertile ground very effectively her focus is on two best friends - sarah zuckerman our narrator whose older sister died before she was born and jennifer jones her poised all american best friends jennifer becomes her \"sister of choice\" and the two are inseparable the 10 year olds decide one day to write letters to soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace in a great surprise jenny's letter is answered and she is invited by the premier to visit the ussr and see that it too is a peace loving nation for a brief time jenny becomes a media sensation causing a rift between the girls but when her plane goes down - killing her and her parents - sarah is left to wonder did jenny really die or was there more to the story than meets the eye all of this is established quickly so no spoilers the meat of the story concentrates on sarah as a young adult now temporarily living in moscow and trying to make sense out of jenny's death it is very evident that elliott holt has done her research she writes \"going to moscow was like stepping through a magic portal to a very different world a world of superstition and shadows of poetry and deadly icicles defectors and spies secret messages and invisible ink \"indeed this reader felt as if she had been given a magical passport to the ussr who knew for example that most soviets were avid readers that they loved ice cream even in winter that the main ingredient in salads was mayonnaise that babushkas older russian women scolded people readily on the streets these are all minute details true but when added up they present a strong sense of place i should also add that elliott holt writes like a dream creating entirely believable characters and locations my only reservation is that this author seemed to be torn between creating two books one is the story of sarah and jenny an autopsy of sorts of a lost friendship abandonment issues and the shifting meanings of truth that story with its psychological underpinnings is beautifully created equally beautifully created is a story of the friend left behind who is navigating the alien world of the ussr where truth and propaganda constantly shift boundaries where the boundaries sometimes overlap with our own battles with truth and propaganda and where no one can ever be sure that what they believe is what truly has happened the author is so comfortable in her knowledge of the ussr that she sometimes drops the threads of the first story instead of seamlessly interweaving those threads this is a 4 star book that is very close to being a 5 star book in a broader sense it is about the stories we tell ourselves to grow and even to survive","295":"this brought back a lot of memories of growing up in the 80s and fearing that the soviet union would attack us with a nuclear bomb this was an interesting read and i liked that the ending didn't really answer my big question definitively","296":"3 5 4 this is a fast reading very well written book in terms of subject matter it reminded me a lot of the americans which is a good connotation i liked the ambiguity of it but i'm not sure where to rate it because there was a certain shallowness too it that i have trouble articulating i think it would have worked better in a shorter format which is how the author said it started the prose is strong but i think both too long and too short at the same time i'm aware that makes no sense but i'm sticking to it","297":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the premise had potential but for me the writing was at best average the ending rather than being the cliffhanger i expect the author intended seemed disjointed and left one wondering about the purpose of the entire story","298":"a coming of age cold war spy story told with flashbacks this should be a confusing mess but somehow holt manages to tie together the disparate elements with the theme of defection rejection and loss throughout it wasn't great for me but it was a good read i would give it 3 1 2 stars if i could","299":"i grew up during this time period but i must say that the cold war really didn't faze me much maybe it was because i didn't have a parent who obsessed about it really didn't inspire me to take any trips to russia either","300":" tremendous fantastic debut novel in the first paragraph holt describes the moscow streets as slushy with resentment and you know you are in the hands of an exquisite precise fully formed craftswoman then in part one holt recreates perfectly the story of a friendship between two young women in the early 1980's and you know you are reading a story that will stick with you long after you close the cover then in part two the central motifs of the story political defection personal betrayal loss and recovery start intertwining resonating loudly within one another and you know this one is worth rereading to retrace the steps of how holt arrived there i loved it","301":"fun read page turner set in washington dc during the 1980's when the cold war was in full swing","302":"i liked it but it wasn't amazing probably closer to 3 5 stars for me it's a cold war tale a heartbreaking look at modern russia a mystery and a coming of age story all in one","303":"really enjoyed this book read it straight through in a day i would recommend it to anyone who likes the americans not quite the same thing but similar type of setting cold war atmosphere etc","304":"a very pleasantly atmospheric read i finished the last bit on the bus and emerged feeling quite lit by the glow of the last chapter i'll have to reread the final chapters most of the book was a fairly interesting ramble through 80s washington dc and 90s russia neither of which i've experienced at all though it seemed to register as delightfully authentic to some remnant cultural footprint leftover in my subconscious with some concealed uncomfortable desperation but the last chapter was positively radiant i definitely have yet to process most of the feelings and nuances there but even without those the massive emissions from mental and emotional tectonics were unmistakable and brilliant","305":"i loved the premise and the moscow background of part of the book many of the cold war era details felt force recited and not second nature to the narrative the main protagonist wasn't especially sympathetic although i think the author intended her to be her mother had an important and what i felt was an unlikely change of heart in the end many moments didn't feel like they jibed with the story as it had been set out for the reader and the lack of an actual denouement was a little bit of a letdown","306":"i saw this book and being a literature and history teacher jumped at the chance to read it i wanted to like it i really did but the ending left me with a great disappointment i felt that the climax of the book was within the first few chapters and then it suddenly died i liked how the main character sarah was a lost introvert trying to find her way this is what is very popular with young adults today however i would not recommend this book to anyone younger than the high school age there are some rather graphic parts of the book","307":"fantastic seriously","308":"needed a half star for this one not quite a 4 but close in the one section the author dragged out the protagonist's stupidity and patience in such an unrealistic way you want to make her that stupid and that meek you've got to explain her thinking better so i believe it other than that i enjoyed the read","309":" this is the kind of book that makes me wish i was studying it in a literature class and had a genius professor and students much smarter to me to help unveil all that is going on because this book has so many layers i'm sure i didn't catch them all it's the story of a young woman named sarah and her best friend from childhood jenny growing up during the cold war and what happens when they write letters to russian leader yuri andropov at age 10 initially i wondered if elliott holt was inspired by the true story of sarah york who at age 10 became pen pals with panamanian general manuel noriega and visited panama to help relations between the two countries check out a very wonderful 'this american life' segment about sarah york's experience with noriega http www thisamericanlife org radio but no apparently letter writing campaigns to foreign leaders was popular in the early 80s the story was based on another true story http elliottholt tumblr com post 47 to conclude you are one of them is a page turner so it's likely to win admiration from a wide audience but it's also got true literary merit very beautifully written with a consistent tone throughout i'm still pondering some ambiguity that comes at the end and wish i had someone to discuss it with i am not sure i loved said ambiguity but i still give this book four stars wish i could do 4 1 2 because it kept me entertained i finished it in lightning speed stimulated my brain made me wish i was a novelist and made me super excited to hear holt speak at the end of the month","310":" 3 5 out of 4 stars set during the height of the cold war and the late 1990's you are one of them is the story of sarah zuckerman who has spent most of her life preoccupied with her childhood friend jenny though the girls are best friends initially jenny becomes a celebrity after writing a letter to yuri andropov and soon does not have time for sarah unfortunately jenny and her family die in a plane crash before the girls can reconcile leaving an empty wound in sarah's already sad life sarah really has a hard time letting go and i mean really just cannot move on thus after college when she gets a mysterious email from a young woman who claims to know jenny she heads to moscow to uncover the truth behind what really happened to her friend overall i enjoyed this book i liked the characters and i found the premise of the mystery to be intriguing unfortunately parts of the book seem super rushed and while holt builds some interesting personalities none of them get the attention or number of pages they deserve i also found the ending to be abrupt view spoiler don't expect to get any satisfaction from the conclusion ugh hide spoiler i do think holt does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere in russia during the late 1990's and in many ways this novel is almost like a little love letter to that period of history","311":"although i was totally uncertain where this book was going the writing and plot compelled me to go along for the ride i got confused a bit in moscow but ultimately i think i get it like all the most interesting books this one had me reading lots of wikipedia entries about topics from the book this time perestroika the ussr and russia in general i was a young kid and young teenager for much of this book's timeline and it was really interesting to read about a world that i remember only at the periphery","312":"2 5 3 forgot that i read it so that says something","313":"i finished this book in less than a day the story was so engaging sarah zuckerman lives in the wake of defections as she calls them the death of her older sister isabel and her best friend jennifer jones' plane crash when she was 12 and her parent's divorce the story takes place during various time periods of sarah's life and it seems as if she's writing from her thirties but i didn't figure that out until the last chapters of the book which made the narrative a bit confusing for me the first part of the story takes place in the early eighty's during sarah and jenny's adolescent friendship the girls become connected at the hip as sarah struggles through her mother's paranoia about nuclear war and agoraphobia the loss of her sister and lack of a father jenny's life is perfect a few streets over creating a world and family which sarah lusts after and the normality she craves during the summer of 1983 the jones' family's perfection cracks and the girls' friendship fizzles as the girls enter adolescents the girls' friendship is further complicated when they write yuri adropov which is actually sarah's idea because of her mother's quest for peace jenny is thrown into the spotlight when her letter is published and the girls grow apart during her fifteen minutes of fame jenny's fame ends during a plane trip to maine when her chartered plane crashes into the ocean leaving sarah with endless loneliness and questions sarah grows to her own life as she attends college and pursues her own life leading her to a post graduation trip to moscow russia in 1995 she is invited by one of jenny's friends who met her during a peace mission before her death moscow is incurring a burst of cosmopolitanism as western travelers and business people enter a developing russia through svetelana sarah discovers not only the cultural places and spaces of moscow but the she answers many of sarah's questions about the girl sarah believed she knew everything about i don't quite know how i feel about the ambiguous ending but i think for sarah she got the answers she was looking for and was allowed to continue with her life free of jenny's ghost","314":"i am glad this book exists because it documents a big part of my life in small ways born in the late seventies growing up in the eighties fear of the cold war facination with russia i enjoyed the time spent reading this book read it if you were born in the 70's or early 80's","315":"i really liked this book there was a good and intriguing central mystery that kept me hanging on and the writing was really light and lovely i'm a sucker for stories about lady friends and this one had lots of moments that rang particularly true it also cemented my impression that russians are pricks","316":"i read it almost too quickly flipping eagerly through pages always waiting for more and was surprised when it ended kindle it almost ended too quickly although it is not one of my favorite novels the characters are well developed and the historical context is well researched she did a great job on her first novel and i await what comes next","317":"i could not put this novel down it's a page turner about loneliness heartbreaking and nerve wracking and utterly compelling","318":" not too many cold war era historical fiction eschews the dark of night cloak and dagger stuff or centers on women so this was different the narrative occurs post cold war in the yelstin days of the new russia but reflects on the reagan andropov era this is a story of friendship and betrayal trust and disbelief between countries people and between two young girls caught up in the 80s frenzy i am not sure i liked the ending as it kind of lost its momentum and oomph the characters were interesting some likeable some not holt at points got a little too windy on explaining all things russian and i think he could have been more succinct in that regard but overall not a bad read","319":"i received this book from goodreads giveaway this book gripped me from the beginning i actually was quite surprised as i did not expect to enjoy the book i read this book in one day as i could not seem to put it away i was able to identify with the characters and the emotional roller coaster that certain situations caused i would definitely recommend this book","320":"i was obsessed with the samantha smith story in the 80s so the subject matter of this book a fictional look at a scenario where she with a different name didn't die but instead defects to the ussr intrigued me the writing was strong and the characters interesting i am not sure how i feel about the ending but overall i would certainly recommend the book","321":"things that may have influenced my experience with this book i follow elliot holt on twitter i started following her because she was a judge in the 2013 tournament of books one time i tagged her in a tweet related to the 2013 tob she favorited it then unfavorited it i speculated that it was because i said that a m homes' short stories are better than her novels it seems that just about everyone who blurbs this book has a personal connection to the author at least through twitter maybe those twitter relationships occur as a result of the blurbing experience i don't know anything about publishing but this seems possible because i follow the author on twitter i feel like i know things about her even though i know that i don't she's an impoverished artist she's opinionated while reading i could not dissociate elliot holt the twitter personality from elliot holt the writer perhaps because i read the author's bio on the book jacket before reading i could not dissociate the author from the narrator i found the book's concept intriguing but never connected with the narrator the narrator's voice was bland she said interesting things about herself but never said things in an interesting way does that make sense anyway i'm willing to concede that my negative opinion of the narrator is tied too closely to my opinion of the author twitter personality that being said i don't have a negative opinion about the author i do however have a false impression of familiarity with the author that may have influenced my reading of the book other observations this would make an excellent movie i really really liked how this is sort of a book about the cold war and post soviet russia but it's really about the sore feelings left after a tweenage best friend breakup that's truly epic stuff","322":"weird story about a young woman who travels to russia to try to figure out what happened to her childhood friend who had visited russia and then died in a plane crash","323":"ok i promise i will never read books about a certain culture written by a person who never in her life experienced that culture directly the only reason i even finished this crap is because it was short the writing was indeed pleasant so was the plot but the characters and the logic of action was sub sub standard","324":" i really enjoyed the book even though i somewhat predicted the conclusion early on in the book however i feel that we were left hanging and i really needed to know if the woman was really jenny i enjoyed the flashback writing and felt it kept me engaged in the story i can't happen to think to all that is going on today between the two countries and how relations are strained once again i found myself thinking about all of this as i was reading the book i think the author did a wonderful job in writing while there were some details that i skimmed as i read i did feel the need to keep reading on to find the truth","325":"while this book was very well written there was nothing exciting or particularly interesting about it to me it's an easy read but it's not overly captivating the subject matter itself is interesting however the plot is bland","326":"good debut novel about a young woman sarah zuckerman traveling to russia after receiving a letter from someone claiming to know sarah's friend jennifer who supposedly died in a plane crash years earlier the two were friends during the cold war and jennifer had the opportunity to visit russia after writing a letter to yuri andropov asking for peace sarah must find out whether the crash was a hoax or if she herself is a pawn in some game good mix of history makes this an intriguing read","327":"beware of spoilers one man's book flap summary is another man's spoiler i don't hide or promote my reviews plot boiled down bff turns out to be nbff not best friend forever this is a novel loosely patterned after the real life story of samantha smith a young american school girl who wrote to u s s r authorities to seek peace the main character here is the onetime best friend of a similar young female letter writer it is a turning of age story as the jacket indicates but i did not view the author elliott holt as a fearless writer which is how a blurb by author kevin wilson on the book's back jacket describes holt","328":"not great but not bad it was fun to read about a trip to moscow around the same time i was there for a year so many memories as a story though this book was pretty unbelievable","329":"http dakimel blogspot com 2013 09 b here's what i liked about this book finding then losing a best friend in late elementary early middle school years the vast importance of who your friend eats lunch with whose friendship pin she wears whose ear may be hearing the secrets you told her during countless sleepovers the depiction of the cold war days reagan and andropov and star wars and the day after from the point of view of a child living through it all holt's facility when describing places the amazing lyricism with which she paints moscow in the 90s will stick with me for a long time still for all that this is presented as a mystery was jenny on the crashed plane or was she not and even at the furthest point of sarah's investigation i just never got around to caring overmuch about the answer it only served to make sarah an untrustworthy narrator and to dull the effect of the things i mentioned above her search through moscow wearied me and i don't think holt's intent was to have her readers grousing at her narrator who cares just drop it and get on with well anything else really i'm trying to not let the story arc detract too much from the lovely parts of this debut novel but instead the second half is very much getting in the way of the first half","330":"a beautifully written story that eventually went nowhere it tried to several times but then veered off the slippery russian roadway hard to pin down this one was it a detective story a tale of a lost soul looking for a clue about life and the grudges we bear i kept waiting for the part where it made sense all the wondering and wandering maybe i just missed it","331":"i find most books that give me some kind of view of the cold war and the soviet union and russia in the 20th and 21st century compelling which largely explains the 4 star rating the writing was very good and the resolution was clever which made for a very readable book but there's something a bit pathetic about the main character","332":"fast and interesting read it made me miss my subway stop which rarely happens","333":"wanted to like it more but you couldn't get on sarah's side with her nonstop whining and in the end you just kinda shrug your shoulders like the author did eh who knows if the author focuses on the plot more and russia and the stark differences it might have been a bit more enthralling i like the writing style so i would read something by the author again but this story didn't show off her talent","334":"the cold war in the 1980s russia spies cigarettes a lot of drinking destruction crass newfound commercialism anxiety and behind it all a mystery of sorts about two young girls who are best friends until one of them becomes an ambassador of peace and supposedly dies all of this is enough to keep me up until 1 30 am to finish it loved it","335":"this was a super easy and fast read and it's one of those books that gets better once you think about it some more afterward on the surface it seemed like a pretty straightforward story but as the momentum builds you realize that there are all kind of secrets and possible explanations and layers of meaning i'm also fascinated by russia and have visited so i liked the sprinkling of russian words descriptions of moscow and the cold war history spoiler alert the ending is left wide open to interpretation but for the record i don't think zoya was actually jenny i know it's possible but i'm glad sarah didn't give her the money even if it was her their friendship is gone and she doesn't deserve it","336":"tore through this book after a long summer of nonfiction and really enjoyed it an honest thoughtful reflection on girlhood friendships against the backdrop of 80's cold war politics references to things like duck u0026amp cover drills and moody boys with eyeliner on or maybe i added the eyeliner bit established a very familiar scene reading the descriptions of 90's moscow alongside those memories gave a sense of the bleakness and insularity but also the expectancy and hopefulness of early teen age","337":" this is hands down one of the best books i've read perhaps it's because i came of age in the dc area in the 1980s and majored in russian studies so this novel hit me on a personal level but that alone is insufficient to explain my deep affection for this book meticulously researched achingly beautiful it captures the effect of breaking up with your childhood bff while also exploring the ramifications of the end of the cold war in russia all by using a nearly forgotten story of an american girl who wrote to the soviet leader to oppose nuclear war bravo","338":"this story had some interesting twists and turns and addressed some important themes e g overcoming fear living in the past vs the present but overall was underwhelming","339":"a very good bookseller thank you hans weyandt put you are one of them in my hands when i asked him for a recommendation of new fiction then the book joined a stack moved to a shelf and disappeared behind its plain white spine until i saw the title seven months later and couldn't remember what it was or how it got there once back in my hands i recognized the cover which i'd first taken for an image of a old farm truck window with a scorch mark obscuring a woman's face on closer look it appears to be a decrepit subway car of the wrong vintage to represent the reagan era period of the story after breezing through you are one of them in two days however i've concluded the cover does fairly represent this layered and accessible novel the plot is based on a historical figure child peace star samantha smith renamed jenny jones and her gesture toward soviet premier yuri andropov then asks what if as the story develops questions emerge ambiguities surface and the narrator goes to moscow herself to retrace her young friend's earlier sojourn she finds the post yeltsin country trying on a new image and set of economic principles while being tied closely to the past while the mystery of what really happened to jenny propels the novel the main story is about how the narrator sarah zuckerman has had her own life defined by external events and the judgments of others she had difficulty reading the signals from parents school friends lovers and now people she meets in russia always concluding the fault is somehow hers meanwhile her friend jenny seemed to float through all life's bumps until though the story has the trappings of a spy novel in elliott holt's hands it explores the mundane intelligence we keep from ourselves about family friendship love and ambition and what we really need from each other in order to achieve peace the writing is very lucid the story moves quickly and i found the ending without big revelations or even satisfying explanations to wrap it up to be the right one as someone who studied russian in college many years ago i found the author's insertion of the language an effective method for reminding us of sarah's one foot in one foot out of the culture and distance from the truths under her nose a reader unfamiliar with the language shouldn't find it off putting and for this reader the snippets brought an additional layer of enjoyment yes i remember knowing that but can't quite recapture it","340":"when sarah zuckerman and jennifer jones become friends in elementary school in suburban dc in the early 80's the cold war is a definite presence in their lives influenced by her pacifist mother sarah decides to write a letter to soviet premier andropov and jennifer does the same jenny's letter causes the soviet government to invite her and her family to russia on a public relations tour and when she comes back a celebrity the girls drift apart 3 years later jenny and her family are killed in a plane crash when sarah graduates from college she feels drawn to visit russia based on her russian language classes and a mysterious e mail from jenny's former host on her russian trip that suggests that jenny is still alive and living in russia sarah goes to moscow on a quest to find out about jenny and herself","341":"not the most mysterious book ever but a good easy read the author lost me a few times jumping from childhood to thirties and then to her twenties but you get the idea","342":"this is a book of fear paranoia perceptions and an inability to let go of the past there were things i liked about the book interesting characters the history of american views during the cold war the history of russia and the changing climate there there is a mystery running through the book as well but i was a bit disappointed in the end and felt it didn't quite deliver","343":"whoa just whoa","344":"i really enjoyed this book until the end i wish i could give this 4 stars but the promise of the book seemed kind of unfulfilled to me when then ending was essentially and i realized i didn't care about everything i just spent the entire book fascinated by there are also references to sarah's more recent life but we never really find out how she got there which was disappointing to me as well","345":" grabbed this one off the display table at the library hoping for a good mystery very disappointed in that area still gave the book three stars because despite the random pointless dialog with meaningless characters and the lame 80's references just thrown in here and there to prove the author had done her homework or that she actually lived through springsteen and black rubber bracelets there were some great characters with a real depth of feeling and life lessons learned good read but not a read again","346":"it felt like a very long road to the end the concept girl's childhood friend is either killed in a plane crash or defects with her parents to the ussr is good but the long winded diversions with various characters bored me also a lot of angsty adolescent stuff","347":"a quick and engaging read if not particularly substantive my favorite element was the spot on descriptions of being an american in russia in 1996 i traveled to moscow in my early 20s in the 2000s and it was much the same","348":" sarah and jennifer are two young girls who are best friends sarah decides to writ a letter to the soviet premiere to ask for peace this was during the cold war and jennifer writes one too jennifer has always been the popular one and of course her letter is published and her family is asked to visit the soviet union jennifer becomes very well know as the young girl for peace but one day she and her parents are killed in a plane crash many years later sarah receives a letter implying that jennifer is still alive and is in russia sarah goes to russia and after much mystery she meets the woman she thinks is jennifer turns out jennifer's father was a russian spy jennifer asks for money and sarah ends up coming back to the us without knowing if it was really jennifer or not quite interesting audio book","349":"loved this that's all i'll say because to describe it would probably give away the ending read it","350":"a mildly irritating first person novel about the icky sticky friendship between two girls one sad and one charming loosely based on the story of sammantha smith a 10 year old who wrote a letter to andropov asking for world peace","351":"i listened to this book in audio format and thought the story was completely spellbinding and i enjoyed the storyline and how it got you to think about perception and what is real and what is not depending on how you look at it","352":"unique coming of age tale idea could have been cheesy but holt pulled it together well","353":"4 5 quite good sometimes too much nostalgia about her life with jenny pre disappearance but a unique story i've been reading a lot about russia lately and this was a good addition to that","354":" oh how i dislike ambiguous endings yet had the author chosen anything but ambiguity for this novel of the cold war it wouldn't have rung true to me based on the true story of samantha smith the maine girl who wrote to yuri andropov was invited to the soviet union for a two week tour became famous and later died in a plane crash this story is about sarah and jenny two friends living in washington dc during the cold war sarah decides to write a letter to andropov and jenny follows suit jenny's letter draws attention sarah's does not and the friends grow apart jenny dies soon after years later sarah receives a cryptic letter from the russian friend who had been paired with jenny during the media tour she decides to travel to russia to meet the friend and get some answers the russian part of the book moves faster than the washington part and i found it more interesting historical and cultural details about the new i e post soviet union russia expatriate culture and the russian outlook on life are interwoven well with the plot nothing is what it seems it seems the book held my interest through most of an afternoon","355":"holt over the course of twenty years of fictional time in her book creates a complex relationship between two people weaves in an obsession and holds it together with a tether of mystery this is a very solidly constructed book and i'm guessing the structure came after character for holt for more go to http annotationnation wordpress com","356":"i picked this up because it was included in this article in time i enjoyed the cold war setting and the musings on friendship but didn't care for the ending i don't need everything wrapped in a pretty bow in the end but it was too abrupt for me proceed with caution","357":"topped this off in 2 days a beautifully written if predictable story about friendship and finding yourself in the reagan era lots of vodka and cold war references thrown in take it to the beach","358":"beautiful writing loved the descriptions of both moscow and cold war era united states ending left a little to be desired though and i didn't think sarah's issues felt completely resolved","359":"enjoyed this","360":" in this tightly wound narrative holt tells the story of two young girls whose relationship has thawed to what seems to be the point of no return when jenny along with her family are the victims of a fatal plane crash when sarah receives news that jenny and her parents' deaths might have been part of an elaborate hoax she sets off to russia in search of the answers that she is so desperately seeking many truths that are revealed hit pretty hard and i am very compelled to recommend this book it is good for fiction writers as it demonstrates a strong sense of fear and love and is told in an intelligent and moving manner","361":" i particularly liked the cultural references as i am about the same age as the main character born in the early 70s and growing up in maryland i can relate to the setting thoroughly enjoyed reading the sections set in russia as well for the most part the book is very well done and extremely interesting however i only gave it 3 stars because i was very dissatisfied with the ending the ambiguity make work for some readers but this one wants a very deliberate and neat and tidy ending this one just left me with more questions","362":"i did like this book and appreciated the incisiveness of the writing but it read to me like a 'light' version of several genres it's not at all hefty enough on the cold war history for example to satisfy readers of that genre and it's also somewhat light as an examination of female friendship readers who might compare this to any of the brilliant considerations of this topic by lorrie moore will be left feeling unsatisfied i think","363":" there is something in this story that's hard to turn away from a search for truth or perhaps a search for self sarah zuckerman seeks a presumed dead childhoold friend in moscow add in the backstories of sarah her family her friend jennifer and there's a fascinating intertwining of family personalities and a little bit of post cold war history however between the time leaps and the vagueries of who sarah really is and what she wants there's a little too much unsorted confusion i did like the writing and would love to read more of ms holt's work","364":" in the end everyone turns away from sarah zuckerman--defectors at least that's how it feels the first to flee sarah's proximity is the toddler who should have become her big sister dead shortly thereafter grief and anxiety leave sarah with a mother only capable of a fierce exhausting cautionary love--a leftover mother then off goes the father to another land and another family with brighter smiles--a do over father and so sarah exists in her grey world which is not terribly good but not terribly bad although catastrophe is most certainly right around the corner at least that's what her mother obsessed with the possibility of a nuclear war constantly reminds her then jenny jones moves in across the street with her blonde hair and freckles for a delicious while the girls' lives conjoin and sarah becomes \"jenny and sarah\" becomes \"something resembling happy \" all the suburban banalities of jenny's life gracefully and graciously eclipsing the abnormalities of sarah's but when the girls both write letters to soviet premier yuri andropov only jenny's garners national attention after that jenny's glow becomes too harsh for sarah and the friends drift ultimately jenny defects from sarah's life too at least this is what sarah believes until she receives a mysterious email during her senior year of college ten years later and heads off to russia in search of a new truth a fast paced book studded with exquisite must read it again prose \"you are one of them\" is a poignant study of the ways in which certain people pull us into their orbit and how we hover--grateful moons--just to be close to them rich with details of cold war era 80s youth and post cold war russia holt's debut novel hits all the right social emotional cultural and pop cultural notes perhaps most deftly though \"you are one of them\" artfully portrays the ways in which grief and longing motivate and manipulate us","365":"i absolutely loved this book i identified very strongly with the narrator as i was also 10 years old in 1982 and also later living as an ex pat in the mid 90s i was completely and utterly intrigued by the story","366":"good story nothing spectacular but not terrible either i like that the ending was ambiguous and that sarah still manages to fine closure","367":" when two girls decide to write letters to the soviet premier in the 1980s one girl's letter is answered she and her family get invited to russia and the girls start to drift apart when the family is killed in a plane crash the survivor sarah discovers there are unanswered questions that remain about the family later when she is given a chance to go to russia she tries to uncover the truth about her former friend along the way she comes to an understanding about her relationship with her trouble mother","368":"i kept waiting for something big to happen in the end the twist wasn't all that shocking good story different theme than other books i have read interesting history at times all the russian translation made this hard to follow","369":"lovely evocative writing a good companion piece to my new favorite show the americans great sense of place both affluent dc of the early 80's and post communist russia of the 90's and character ambiguous endings are not my favorite but on the whole it was a satisfying read","370":"it's obvious that holt has spent time in russia as she nails the personalities of the people as well as the country in an honest and open way a well written debut with clever dialogue and plot a combination of psychological mystery and historical fiction while some reviewers were unhappy with the ending i thought is was perfectly fitting a new author to watch out for","371":"this book moved rather quickly and i wanted to keep going to see how it ended but i didn't really like the payoff i thought the story was really good and it was a good look into the psyche of a young woman's life that had been impacted by three major tragedies while i understand not closing out the final loop of the story and leaving ambiguity as that is what i think the story required i felt like maybe there was going to be a scooby doo final scene unveiling given the marketing and it wasn't there maybe if this book was marketed differently my expectations would have been different and i would have liked it more though then i may have never bought it","372":"what an utterly perfect ending reading part one the adolescent version of myself emerged with all my strong and long lasting grudges i was outraged for sarah i was dying for her redemption i also really appreciated that it took place during the cold war it seems like such an overlooked era in historical fiction","373":"griping book could not put it down and didn't want it to end","374":"great descriptions of childhood friendship and how quickly it can change interesting idea for a story but i became less interested in the plot as the book went on","375":"i liked this story and the way it unfolded i think eh did a great job developing an original story line and it's really well written","376":"this was a really good debut novel i am looking forward to more books from this author","377":" there are books that you can't put down and that you shirk responsibilities to get to and this is one of them it is such a good blend of beautifully written portrayals of early childhood memories and coming of age moments set against an intriguing backdrop of cold war america in the second part the way it describes the character's experience in post cold war russia is utterly fascinating and makes a fulfilling companion to the first section of the novel maybe i'm biased since i love the fx show 'the americans' which has similar aspects to it and is phenomenal please watch if you haven't but this book was a treat from start to finish","378":"i read holt's debut quickly because it was an easy and pleasurable read the last page is great haunting with a touch of childish innocence that is also wise and it echoes the book's mournful nostalgia perfectly although i liked reading about 1990s russia i did in the middle of the novel feel like some scenes got a bit top travelogue for my taste especially since they felt like a device to prologue delay the revelation of plot i saw the twist coming from very early on and in a way i wish there was a more intricate secret buried in the story though holt handles the final twenty pages wonderfully and i love their ambiguity overall i enjoyed this graceful and compelling narrative","379":" i loved this book for a few reasons number one it was really well written this was elliott holt's first novel and in this reader's opinion he nailed it there was a lot of rich detail along with a lot of dialogue which gave the reader clear insight into just what made the each character tick number two the story begins when we meet sarah we learn from the onset that her twin sister died at an early age from meningitis sarah's mother plunges to a deep ravine of agoraphobia anxiety eventually sarah's father leaves and moves to britain she sees him very little after that and is forced to live in an eerily weird environment with a mother who is afraid of everything these facts are crucial to understanding sarah as the book progresses the rest of the story is about sarah's girlhood friend jenny and the ups and downs of their relationship they did everything together including writing letters to yuri andropov expressing their fear of communism the russians deem jenny a poster child for peace and their friendship dwindles shortly there after jenny and her parents are killed in a plane crash but were they really sarah grieves her friend and the times that they shared often feeling abandoned and angry as sarah matures and the cold war ensues she receives an email from a russian girl who swears that jenny is still alive that her death was staged as a reader i was pleasantly surprised how what seemed to be a simple story turned into a tale of intrigue and drama i really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it","380":"i picked this up because i'd seen it discussed on talking covers http talkingcovers com 2013 07 23 y and it turned out to be a nice companion to another d c book i just read in which the main character goes abroad searching for a lost friend at the bottom of everything by ben dolnick i loved all the new russia capitalism for beginners details figuring out how to market czar cola using soviet imagery etc","381":" this is a fun book with elements of a coming of age story mixed with a mystery with some spy fiction thrown in for good measure if that sounds like it might be a mess it's not largely because holt does a great job of grounding the story in sarah a protagonist who manages to be both unique and relatable i love the sub genre of books about people going to exotic locales to find long lost friends enemies mysterious people heart of darkness state of wonder the third man most of my unproduced screenplays so sarah's journey to moscow to uncover the truth about her friend jennifer was an easy sell for me but i think even if i weren't a sucker for the genre i'd have enjoyed this one the atmosphere of anticipation and its sinister brother dread serve this book so well and the themes of identity and ambiguity are persistent without being too obvious and there's also cold war nostalgia is nostalgia the right word and great russian malapropisms and interesting jumps in time in this book and so much to recommend it a very strong debut","382":"good quick read with a slightly hurried ending","383":"good but a little thin like the americans but without the wigs","384":"interesting well written roman a clef about samantha smith the child who wrote to ussr president yuri andropov cold war era and was invited to visit the ussr with her family visit was in july 1983 samantha's story is told by her former close friend who travels to russia to retrace samantha's steps dear mr andropov my name is samantha smith i am ten years old congratulations on your new job i have been worrying about russia and the united states getting into a nuclear war are you going to vote to have a war or not if you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war this question you do not have to answer but i would like to know why you want to conquer the world or at least our country god made the world for us to live together in peace and not to fight sincerely samantha smithsamantha and her family died in a private plane crash in 1985 elliot holt's fictionalized version you are one of them has some twists and turns good read for conspiracy theorists","385":" sarah zuckerman and jennifer jones were best friends during the 1980s one afternoon they both decide to write letters to yuri andropov about creating peace between russia and the usa jenny's letter gets published and she is invited with her family to come visit russia to see how great the country is sarah is left behind on a return flight back home jenny's plane crashes and jenny and her family instantly lose their lives was this an accident or a point made by two politically opposing countries 20 years later sarah receives a letter from svetlana a russian citizen who hints that jenny may in fact not have been in that plane sarah races to russia to find out this story had a great excitable premise however while reading it felt like i was trudging through mud every time i set it down i was in no hurry to pick it back up the author's thoughts were rampant and seemed unorganized and chaotic needless to say i'm glad that i finally finished it","386":"really a 4 5 star read for me minus a half star for the unresolved ending","387":"between 3 4 stars a quick good read in some ways a nice hiatus filler for the great fx show the americans if you're a fan of the show i definitely recommend this book a similar 80s cold war flavor","388":"surprisingly quick read but good u0026amp satisfying ambiguity and all i doubt a non ambiguous ending would have worked i hadn't realized it was based on actual events i'm guessing someone who recalls this era well or knows us russia relations deeply would find a lot more to love here than i did or perhaps find more to poke holes in though on that note i did find the depiction of 80s rich kid d c to be pretty spot on","389":"really enjoyed this one and thought the writing was terrific","390":"two girls one letter written in the '80's during the cold war mystery friendship and family relationships are developed in this fast paced novel a great book to begin 2015","391":"i really liked the sense of place i got in all of the action that took place in russia i've never been to russia so i have no idea how accurate the descriptions were but the author painted a pretty strong picture the childhood flashbacks were less interesting to me anyway pretty intriguing and i kind of liked where things were left at the end","392":"interesting look at the cold war obviously partly inspired by a true story except for the ending quick read","393":"wouldn't have picked this up except for the glowing reviews that i heard about it and it definitely held up original idea well written sort of a quiet lonely haunting book but i really enjoyed it","394":"great book didn't love the ending though it left me wanting for more","395":"loved this incredible book i couldn't put it down","396":"with focus on the cold war secrets and defectors this book fit in well with the spy novel streak i have been on i was confused while reading this book but in a good way i love a character that you can root for and this book delivered with a main character who was a pushover plagued with tragedy","397":" i received this book for free through goodreads first reads i enjoyed the book it was easy to read interesting and a story unlike one i had ever read before holt tied together the main character's past and present very well and ended the book on an empowering note the book is about sarah the main character and her relationship with her childhood best friend jenny both girls wrote letters to yuri andropov and jenny's letter received a response jenny was invited to the soviet union and became a media sensation soon after she died in a plane crash sarah received a letter from a friend of jenny's in russia inviting her to tour russia she also wrote about the possibility of jenny being alive sarah went to russia in search of the truth along the way she learned much about herself who she was before jenny's death and who she became after it was a good book although i would have liked to read a little bit more about the emotional experiences sarah was going through so that i could connect and feel for her just that little bit more other than that holt wrote well and as mentioned above connected sarah's past and present very well i'm so excited to have won one this goodreads book and i recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing page turner weekend read","398":"memories of the cold warwhile i found the plot bogged down in the middle and became a bit tedious i enjoyed the romp though a time when the ussr and the u s pointed nuclear weapons at each other and children on both sides lived in fear of impending doom while simultaneously living their young lives with tenuous and complicated friendships","399":"this was a pretty good story with some intrigue kept me guessing throughout a less than satisfying ending in my view","400":"even without intimate knowledge of washington or moscow this book is an incredible page turner a very easy and enjoyable read that is a lot of fun to consume the plot is not necessarily complex but certainly has enough going on to maintain a high level of interest throughout the ambiguity of the ending is great because it leaves the reader to question the truth an underlying theme of the era and the book but i would have appreciated a few more page to flesh out the ending post climax and reduce the abruptness of the wrap up to the plot i would have given this 4 stars but i've spent most of my life in washington or the surrounding area and i also spent last year living in moscow the details of both cities are absolutely dead on and makes this so realistic so many pages hit very close to home her observations of moscow although almost 20 years before i went are so eerily similar to my own the realism in these areas is what really makes this work of fiction trick my mind into absorbing it as non fiction which i love","401":"pleasantly surprised to have liked this book so much it really sounded good but didn't expect it to be soo good from the moment i started reading i kept being intrigued by the writing and the way the author explained and expressed things like whaaattt very original story and quite mesmerizing not used to that genre either so will remember this book for a long time maybe re read it too learnt some russian too and a good history lesson along the waygonna read more form elliott holt","402":"a quick read not my favorite story it's a tale of a young girl named sarah and her best friend jenny who write letters to the russian leader yuri andropov it shows how the mayhem in diplomacy between the usa and russia during the cold war caused a rife between the two girls what happened to jenny is released during the final pages of the book","403":"didn't finish seemed unfocused","404":"quick easy enjoyable read but the ending was a bit abrupt i thought","405":"in this novel sarah and her jennifer jones write letters to the president of russia during the cold war asking for peace jennifer and her family become media sensations after her letter is printed in the russian paper some time later jennifer and her family perish in a plane crash over the next ten years sarah comes to terms with the loss of her best friend however she is contacted by a russian girl claiming jennifer did not die in a plane crash but is living in russia sarah travels to russia in hopes of finding her missing friend about half or two thirds of the way through i got bored and just wanted to know if jennifer was alive strong points of this novel were the sense of time and place but neither russia nor the cold war really appeal to me i'd much rather a book set in england during wwii but that was not this book sarah was kind of annoying after awhile the book was not terrible and certainly the writing was strong but overall the plot which originally seemed fresh and innovate left me cold","406":"don't remember this book that well","407":"interesting novel that will appeal to adults who grew up in the decades following the the cold war the writing was solid and enjoyed the friendship storyline mixed with the politics of the time i felt she rushed the ending which is why i gave only three stars","408":"having grown up in washington this book hit very close to home so i think that is why i liked it the main characters went to what was described as an all girls school on the cathedral grounds sounds like mine it is a quick read","409":"after reading a review from a friend i was nervous to read this book i was hoping it wasn't too historical and that i'd be able to follow along luckily it was an easy u0026amp quick read i got pulled into the friendship between jenny and sarah immediately and it reminded me of my own childhood i did think that there were details and parts of the book that were unnecessary to the plot of discovering what truly happened to jenny when sarah met svetlana and some mystery began to unfold is when i got really interested i don't think the parts about sarah's life in russia parties work etc were relevant to the ultimate plot at all seemed more like filler to take up some chapters without any spoilers i liked the way it ended would i recommend it to other readers undecided","410":"loved it sarah is a really relatable narrator and the story of her friendship with jennifer and her life after is filled with little moments that gave me that tingling feeling of recognition holt crafts some beautiful and stark images a film strip burning up cans off off brand cola which have stuck with me long after finishing the novel","411":"if this book is positioned as a thriller or mystery i would give it 1 star structure wise as a thriller or mystery it was really flimsy but i was really thankful to the author's great story telling skill which distracted my attention from eagerly looking for a mystery to leisurely listening to a story about half way through part 1 i was almost oblivious of the fact that i originally believed this book was about the mysterious espionage world in the 1980s instead i was sucked into sarah zukerman's world and mainly concerned about what would happen to this 10 year old girl who was shy insecure and lonely she was too young to realize that it was not her fault when her sister and father \"defected\" from her life to her jennifer jones was not just a girl who lived in the house across the street jennifer was everything she was not \"jennifer\" represented an ideal life this idea was rooted in her so deeply that 10 years later a letter from a stranger was enough to lure her to russia to chase jennifer's ghost during this process she gradually came to realize what jennifer really meant to her and how she had viewed herself all her life i would say this is a story about lost and found before she had a chance to define who she was young sarah lost herself in her chaotic life her sister's death her parents' divorce her father's alienation her mother's anxieties cold war superpowers mushroom clouds jennifer's celebrity status and the airplane crash but all these were merely the background no matter how sensational they seemed to be the real focus has always been sarah zukerman a girl then a young woman who went all the way to moscow to look for her best friend and found her true self by losing her best friend i also enjoyed the part of book talking about russia and russian culture p 259 p 173 p 282","412":"beautifully spare and potent in language multi layered in theme and plot love that it was at once simple and complex","413":" in interest of full disclosure i met elliott at tin house several years ago and was so impressed with her and even more so after years of following her on good reads this woman devours books good literary books and how she found time to write a novel and a novel this good is nothing short of amazing yet it also affirms that reading great writing helps you write great writing you are one of them is a novel about an early friendship cut short holt captures the feelings of joyfully discovering gradually distrusting and suddenly losing a best friend in the politics of adolescence with great immediacy she also captures the last decade of the cold war era that backdrop of fear and certainty that the world will end in nuclear holocaust through mutually assured destruction this novel brought back long forgotten details of a time i lived through and was shaped by and rekindled the fascination i had for all things russian and the mysteries behind the iron curtain the scenes of sarah in washington are as alive as those in the former ussr the plot carried me along but the real treasure is holt's marvelous language her sentences are so good i immediately wanted to reread an example describing an underwater breath holding contest from above the pool looked glassy and hard a surface that must be broken with force but below it was soft and beckoning a membrane through which light sieved like sugar the sunlight webbed across jenny's skin and through her hair giving it a reddish tint and the bubbles of air streaming from her nose added to the impressionistic effect suddenly she stretched her mouth open in a ludicrous way and stuck out her tongue my laughter forced me up for air i win jenny announced as she triumphed from below the narrator is odd and honest and takes time to get to know she surprises the ending is thought provoking and ultimately feels right you are one of them satisfies on many levels and i hope it is the first of many novels to come","414":"fun read wouldn't classify as mystery just novel about friendship 20s coming of age","415":"i am not really sure how i feel about this book did i hate it love it i think i just got through it okay and will make the best of it i liked the whole idea of the story line but felt kind of robbed there seemed to be a lot left out or kind of rushed the ending really wasn't a surprise for me i kind of expected it i think the whole book built up to it a growing period for the main character it was kind of a stepping stone into adulthood after all she had to go through the world was not what she thought it to be","416":"recommended by andrea read her review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore are one of them holt","417":"i love a story with a twist and this one had 2 of them at first the second one disappointed me but then i realized the author used it to point out what the novel was really about really enjoyed this one","418":"i liked this book which is inspired by the samantha smith story quite a bit it is told from the perspective of the former best friend of a girl who is chosen to be the youth ambassador to the ussr and while the plot centers around the question of whether that youth ambassador really dies in a plane crash or is she living a secret life the book is really exploring the cold war that can happen between friends can you get back what you've lost","419":" a multi layered novel that rang a lot of bells for those of who grew up during the cold war while the defector metaphor and the cold war allusions are central to this coming of age story i think what nearly got this novel a fourth star from me was the consistent narrative voice so many of today's authors lack the confidence to write 300 pages in one voice but holt's sarah keeps us reading well mostly the reason i withheld that star was because as one other reviewer here wrote i felt done 2 3 way through","420":" for those who grew up in the cold war era you are one of them will resonate with the sense of paranoia and apprehension americans felt toward russia during the 1980s this same theme of uncertainty and distrust echo throughout the life story of sarah zuckerman the novel's protagonist the basic premise of the book revolves around a letter written to yuri andropov by sarah's childhood friend jenny and how jenny is invited to russia to advocate the country's cultural and amicable nature a clever tool for propaganda as some might say during this period tragedy strikes and the whereabouts of jenny become unknown until sarah receives a mysterious e mail that causes her to entertain alternate possibilities most of the novel focuses on sarah's quest for closure regarding jenny's disappearance as she befriends more people and receives contradictory information she soon begins to question what is fact and what is fiction this sentiment parallels cold war espionage and governmental skepticism are people telling the truth or merely saying what wants to be heard","421":"http therumpus net 2013 09 horn rev","422":"i picked this out because i liked the premise sarah zuckerman who grew up in dc in the early 80s like me had a best friend named jenny who lived across the street one day they decide to write letters to yuri andropov to ask for peace between the us and the ussr jenny's letter is singled out by the russian government and she is invited to the ussr as a child ambassador to help thaw relations during the cold war upon jenny's return to the us she becomes a celebrity leaving sarah behind but within a year she and her family have been killed in a private place accident en route to a speaking appearance many years later sarah receives an email from someone in now russia claiming to have met jenny on her visit in the 80s and suggesting that jenny is still alive having defected to russia sarah has to decide whether to pursue the investigation into what really happened to jenny and in so doing address her unresolved issues about the demise of their friendship incidentally about 30 pages in there were details in you are one of them that were so familiar to me that i went online to see where holt went to school sure enough she went to my small dc private school which explains part of why this book appealed to me so much so there are basically two parts of this book the part about sarah and jenny's friendship and the part that explores the mystery of what actually happened to jenny i loved loved loved the first part the treachery of middle school friendships set against the dark backdrop of the cold war was perfectly covered by holt down to the little notes sarah and jenny used to write to each other the cruelties that adolescent girls visit on each other and sarah's sense of isolation and rejection i also enjoyed following sarah into adulthood and seeing how she coped with her deeply flawed family and the insecurities that were ingrained from a young age the second part of the book was a little problematic for me i thought that in russia sarah behaved in ways that were pretty out of character some of the postulated theories about jenny's whereabouts were overly simplistic and should have had more complexity and there is the ending itself which has its own opacity but which i ultimately admired it's hard to address the second part of the book completely without spoiling the ending so i will leave it at that if you've read it and want to discuss it email me russia plays a huge role in this book its history its transformation in the 90s and the ways in which its society adapted to western sensibilities post cold war holt has a great talent for conveying the effect of the city's weather architecture and economy on the psyches of its inhabitants whether native or ex pat you are one of them was my favorite book so far this summer it's not perfect as i said above but i love holt's writing and can't believe this is her first novel i will be watching carefully like kgb da for her next one full review http everydayiwritethebookblog com","423":"this is what happens when you take a political mystery plot and write it in the coming of age genre the whole book is slightly disappointing because it does not live up to the title or the synopsis which prepares you for a espionage style mystery we don't even find out that jenny might not be dead until half way through the book this is not a story about jenny or the cold war but about sarah and how she deals with and perceives the world it also seems like a vessel for ms holt to showcase her knowledge of the russian language i think it's even more disappointing because i did enjoy the writing","424":"i guess it wasn't quite what i expected ok","425":" this is a rather dull and dreary novel much like september in moscow where much of the novel is set during the yeltsin years so maybe the tone is intentional but i didn't find it very inspiring i once heard frank conroy tell aspiring authors that they shouldn't give their readers anything they didn't need that seems like difficult advice to heed but particularly in this case it seemed like the author was giving me a lot that i didn't really need though it's not a long novel by any means","426":" you are one of them which i won from goodreads giveaways is a haunting novel set in 1980's washington and 1990's moscow during politically charged events in history like the cold war and the dismantling of the berlin wall the story revolves around the friendship of two young girls jenny jones and sarah zuckerman from entirely different backgrounds sarah's life is marred by the death of a younger sister divorce an absentee father and a neurotic

sensation and travels to russia the girls' friendship is crippled as jenny's ego escalates and she's absorbed into the popular crowd at school in 1985 the jones die in a plane crash and sarah's world goes into a tailspin but childhood memories of her friend never die in adulthood sarah receives a mysterious letter that suggests jenny's alive and she puts her life on hold to pursue her in the story sarah's sense of self worth and personal identity have been battered by her dysfunctional family she becomes fixated on her childhood friendship with the effervescent jenny who takes the wounded child into her life until fame and the ten year old's blossoming ego tears them apart you are one of them is not only a story of the destructiveness of an unhealthy fixation broken relationships hidden secrets and sarah's search for her self worth and personal identity but it's also about deliverance and healing the author contrasts the two girls beautifully sarah the loner grappling with her feelings of rejection and longing to be secure and loved jenny a bubbly only child who can be mean and self absorbed as i was reading the novel i thought eliot holt's writing style was similar to margaret atwood's as he explores the stark reality of life in the lives of his characters whether american or russian the only criticism i have is at times i lost the thread of the story in the extensive exploration of russia's monuments and other historical sights but this still remains an interesting story and well worth reading","427":"the cold war spies and descriptions of russia were interesting but overall the book was just ok","428":"i really enjoyed the book i couldn't wait to get back to it every night to be in the company of the author's voice again the characters were really well drawn i could see all of them in my mind's eye the descriptions of russia are fantastic visual without being bogged down i am russian so i know p for me the most vivid character was sarah's mother such a colorful psychological portrait since this is not a strict mystery thriller the book ended a little too abruptly for me i wanted it to go a bit longer sarah's obsession to be explored more a bit more psychology there towards the end maybe even a little more danger both for the reader and the characters but overall i felt safe and excited in the hands of the author and looking forward to more books","429":"this was a quick and well done read with the kind of good writing that isn't too flashy but acquits itself simply by telling the story clearly and with lots of detail as i was reading this it occurred to me that i couldn't remember reading another book set in modern day russia well russia twenty years ago anyway just historical fiction set in romanov or earlier times or perhaps during the days of the ussr it was interesting look into a culture and country that i do not know much about and as our narrator sarah is a foreigner as well her experience feels authentic to an american reader her explanations of points of russian customs and russian language that she learns along the way thus come across as genuinely helpful and informative and neither take us out of the story nor patronize the reader i'm very impressed by holt's debut novel and look forward to reading future works from her","430":" a very good book and a particularly impressive first effort the author grew up in dc and spent a good chunk of time in moscow so the descriptions of the two cities are superb she captures life in nw dc better than anyone else i've read the author also does an excellent job bringing the reader into the minds of her characters the pages burst with emotional intelligence and self awareness the book isn't perfect it feels as though the author had the first and final thirds very clear in her head but then had to construct a middle third which sometimes feels forced where the beginning flows beautifully","431":"i liked the author's style of writing","432":"interesting atmosphere of growing up during the cold war and descriptions of russia after the break up of the ussr but none of the characters really grabbed me it was a good discussion book though","433":"better after i finished it than it was along the way i may read it again looking for clues cassandra campbell","434":"the first half of this novel was beautifully written with elegant and descriptive presentation of the friendship between sarah and jenny the themes of friendship and growing up in the cold war era resonnated with me and the closeness of the two girls was relatable it felt in many ways like a short story that was carefully workshopped and honed to near perfection followed by a second story added on in haste to make it something more too bad if i were rating just the first 100 pages it would have been 5 stars sadly the current day story in the second half just didn't capture my interest or have the same emotional impact","435":"well written it's not a mystery at all but just a very thoughtful look at childhood friendships memory and the cold war russia has never looked sleazier yet kind of endearing","436":"one of the things i most appreciated about this smart novel was that it treats ordinary emotions the stuff of our day to day lives with intelligence and respect it is also very well written although there is a mystery at its center you are one of them is very much about friendship loneliness and the period after college when one is trying to figure out what to do the story and the voice are very compelling and i was sad when the book was over","437":"this book started off well but then got slow about 2 3 of the way through and then suddenly ended the ending seemed realistic but the transition between the mid point and the ending of the book needed some work there could have been less repetition in some areas it was mentioned over and over that the main character did not want to be like her mother but more details were needed in other places at one point the author mentions that the main character feels just like she will in the future when the man she expects to spend the rest of her life with leaves her however this is the one and only mention of that situation and the man so it leaves the reader wondering who is this guy and not knowing where that whole topic came from","438":"such an interesting look at russia...well written and wonderful symbolism","439":" this novel was full of nostalgia for me like the main characters i grew up in the 80's u0026amp remembered well the cold war and samantha smith i also lived with in an hour of washington dc and so references to q107 on the radio u0026amp the it boutique commander salamander made me smile i enjoyed the plot and the suspense of what really happened to jennifer jones but as the story progressed i found myself liking or caring about the narrating character sarah zuckerman less and less she seemed to be a victim of her own dysfunctional upbringing not really having a moral compass or standing for anything other than her obsession for her lost friend perhaps that's what the author intended but it made kind of want to just get the book finished i also was really disappointed that towards the end of the story sarah developed a penchant for the f word that just really ruins a book for me there are so many more creative and artful ways for an author to convey emotion with out resorting to offensive language","440":" i won this book via goodreads first reads sorry for my mistakes english is not my first language first of all i didn't know what to expect from this book it wasn't my usual type of book even so it didn't take long for me to get into the story this story is set during the cold war and tells the tale of two childhood friends sarah and jenny who write a letter to yuri andropov to ask for peace it is written from sarah's point of view in the end only jenny's letter got to the premier of the soviet union and it drew a lot of attention from the media with all that's going on sarah and jenny start to pull apart until a tragic accident broke them apart the second part of the book is set a couple of years later when sarah receives a letter from someone in russia who implied that jenny is still alive i won't tell you what's next to not ruin the story for you in the end i decided to give it a 4 it was a really interesting book from the first page of the book i knew that the author was someone with great sensibility all through the book we were able to feel a connection to sarah and sometime i even felt like i was with her in her hometown this story was really different and unique to his kind the only reason i didn't give it a 5 stars rating is because the first part of the book is too long and i takes time to get in the action apart from that it was a great book not my favorite but one that i would recommend to a friend","441":" this novel's style tone and rich layering reminded me so much of the age of miracles by karen thompson walker you are one of them carries on that tradition of quiet coming of age stories where the narrator is a bit older than she was during the course of events but not old enough that she has too much objectivity she is aware of the reality of the events as they were but is still conscious of the reality as she saw it she is not too distanced from her pain this also plays into one of the major themes of the novels is truth relative and does it even matter though the first half of the novel was stronger than the second i did enjoy reading this story a lot holt's sharp details of cold war usa and post cold war russia were well researched they painted a clear image of a time and place that would otherwise be unfamiliar to me this novel was fairly short and at times i felt like it ended too soon i wonder if too much time was spent on the search for jenny jones and not enough on the finding maybe it was the search that really mattered anyway as is often the case","442":"quite interesting but just ran out of steam at the end i think the author could have developed the story better","443":"i enjoyed the first part of the book when the two girls were growing up across the street from one another as friends after that the book mainly just meandered into not much more than a travelogue of moscow which was not awful and some silly bad translations of english russian idioms the mystery was not much of a mystery","444":"i've been on a good book lame ending streak lately this just adds to the long line of lame endings i've been exposed to the first part of the story is pretty good and i liked reading about sarah and jenny's childhood oh youth and best friends and the book did get me thinking and wondering what it must have been like to be coming of age during the cold war it makes me want to talk to my mom and my grandma about it see if it affected them as much as it seems to affect so many protagonists in the books i read elliot holt also writes well so i would be interested in reading more by her but other than that there's not really anything i found to redeem this book it was slow moving and there's no clear ending and the ending there is is very abrupt i didn't like any of the characters everyone seemed so miserable too it made me miserable eh this book just left me cold like the war oh snap","445":"once i finally settled in to read this book after reading the first chapter ages ago i read it in one day compelling story well written and intriguing","446":"i really liked the first third of the book when the girls were young u0026amp before the one girl gained fame i wish the author trusted the reader more to learn the russian phrases parts of the book read like an english russian dictionary i thought 'snowdrops' was a little better","447":"i loved the concept of this book more than the actual story the characters were interesting but not very likable again wish i had the option of 3 5 stars","448":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2013 06","449":"great story keeps you thinking who is a spy and who isn't","450":"read this now","451":"i enjoyed elliott holt's debut novel it grabs you into the story and continues to carry you through out the book the abandonment feelings that sarah felt were well developed and felt so real and relatable i was a little disappointed when i finished but after spending quite a bit of time thinking about it i think it ended the way it should have","452":"i read this book because i was interested in the russian soviet union aspect of the story it turns out that it was less a book of suspense and intrigue and more of a book about friendship loss and growth the scenes set in russia were interesting the writer is adept at creating a very distinct picture of what life in russia is like this book was a more mature look at friendship over the years than the interestings glad i read it","453":"as another reviewer said it reads like a location in search of a plot great stuff about post cold war soviet union and some good writing but overall it flounders a bit","454":" i liked this book mostly for its depiction of modern day or at least 1990s russian life i've never been to russia or to any country in the former soviet union so it was interesting to read the author's take on it this is fiction but the author has been to russia so i'm assuming this is a fairly accurate portrait the story itself is intriguing enough to keep one reading but the ending was a little flat still i would recommend it for anyone who is interested not only in present day russia but also in the cold war era the author has the details down pat","455":"you are one of them is about middle school friendship isolation the cold war and the lengths we will go to get to the heart of a unresolved mystery holt nails the treachery of adolescent relationships and sets up a chilling credible thriller in an exotic but unsettling locale moscow in this impressive debut novel","456":"loved this book great ending it seemed sarah had finally become her own person after living in fear of mostly everything her whole life","457":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was too much in russia and very boring","458":"interesting but ended too soon without enough story","459":"i really enjoyed this book it was face paced and interesting good read","460":"this kept my attention and i found it to be an interesting and entertaining read i particularly enjoyed reading the parts about russia in the 90s and up until the ending i found the story to be really interesting as well but i felt just so let down by the ending it was so dissatisfying i didn't mind too much that she never found out the truth about zoya jenny but it just seemed like nothing was resolved i also found the main character sarah to be so whiney and annoying yes she has had a lot of bad things happen to her but it was just so woe is me all the time and eventually you start to feel like some of these things especially all the failed romantic relationships she keeps referring to are her own fault","461":"a very interior story beautiful prose thought provoking not much suspense","462":"this really gets 4 1 2 stars but i don't know how to do that of if it's even possible this book hooked me from page 1 she's an excellent writer and i can't wait to pick up her next book","463":" a fun read for any of us who came of age during the cold war the first half of the book sets up an innocent yet toxic friendship between two 10 year old girls one of whom betrays the other by claiming all the credit and fame when a letter to yuri andropov makes her famous the famous friend dies soon after in a tragic accident leaving the main character sarah haunted by the unreconciled relationship the second half of the book follows sarah to russia where she is given reason to believe that her friend and family may have not died but instead defected to russia all those years ago the irrational doubt and suspicion are the epitome of the cold war era and a necessary feature to make the story work but don't expect a clear cut answer at the end that would defeat the purpose","464":"a story about two young girls in america during the cold war one goes to moscow and is tragically killed there the other follows years later to determine what really happened the author's use of the russians trying to use american slang was entertaining","465":"excellent gripping book literally could not put it down there was a certain resonance as someone who was a child of the 80s and i particularly enjoyed the parts about how we all came to terms with the internet and this idea that the world was smaller than we imagined there is an intriguing ambiguity in the ending that is quite apt and to end with sarah's letter to yuri andropov and this idea that sometimes the danger is much closer than we want to acknowledge works really well only one issue and i'll get into this in a longer review the prologue wasn't needed at all i pretended it wasn't there after i read it because i don't like prologues they suggest that you need context to understand the novel which suggests you haven't started your story in the right place but this is an outstanding novel the title is perfect and so elegant and you realize that elegance at the end of the book but also throughout lots to talk about here i can't wait til everyone reads it","466":" it's hard to categorize this book it's part novel part mystery and part historical fiction the story which was highly dependent upon flashbacks seemed a bit disjointed but in the end came together quite well i enjoyed the cold war era references though they were a bit heavy handed at times the descriptive language was rich and allowed me to envision places i've never been as well as understanding attitudes and mindsets i'd known about but previously didn't understand without a cultural context the main drawback was the intimate nature of the main character's memories and musings i felt like i really got the know her as a real person but could have done without some of her sexual history although that did prove part of the overall story arc in terms of maturing into a self assured adulthood through lessons learned this was not necessarily a book i'd reread but i certainly don't regret diving into its setting since it effected the world in which i grew up","467":"good but not great","468":"some lovely little observations and phrases in this novel but a bit odd in the combination of a coming of age story with a spy novel enjoyed the period it was set in about 1979 1995 it got the feeling of that time just right","469":"liked the time period good in depth characters mother u0026amp daughter","470":"a very readable and compelling story about friendship and the ongoing battle we have with ourselves to figure out who we are and where we belong holt's prose is lyrical and absorbing post cold war russia never looked so good","471":"although this book had me hooked i actually hated it i was frustrated by the main characters inability to stand up for herself whether as a child or as an adult the premise was ridiculous","472":"the story of a childhood friendship and ultimately a coming of age tale holt writes well captures the details of all engrossing childhood best friendships captures 1980s washington dc from a child's view and presents an interesting and entertaining view of 1990s moscow","473":"i really enjoyed this i learned a lot about life in russia it was a great story about the affect friends from childhood can have on you and how as adults we try to resolve unfinished business","474":"boring","475":"kept me guessing great plot and characters ending frustrated me but i understand why the author did it that way","476":" this is a great book for mystery fans remember samantha smith the little girl who wrote a letter to yuri andropov during the cold war she and her family visited the soviet union several times she wrote a book and became famous then she and her father were killed in a plane crash this book is a similar fiction about jenny jones who went to russia and then died in a plane crash only many years later jenny's best friend hears from her and finds out that the crash was a hoax a fascinating book with lots of information about cold war russia and the aftermath","477":"from todd quietly suspenseful and mysterious i kept my serbian dictionary nearby to see how the russian words in this book compared","478":" arc mystery ish this is more of a coming of age story for a late bloomer when i went to look at this book for a vine choice i was weary because the were some negative comments that the book just ended no the book ends after the main character learns about life herself and getting over the death of a childhood friend that would be a conclusion to a plot and an ample ending btw ambrosial flesh by mary ann mitchell and a is for alibi by sue grafton just end i grew up during the 70s and 80s so i really enjoyed the ussr references from that era i so enjoyed sarah's descriptions of moscow and the citizen and expats attitudes and customs then there was the drama and mystery of what really happened if it did at all are they spies con men friends or something else what parts of her trip to understanding does sarah believe not believe not care or it doesn't matter in the end i definitely recommend","479":"really really liked this gripping vivid beautifully written i loved the ending","480":"i enjoyed reading about russian culture u0026amp moscow lifestyle since i was there in the summer of '97 but the book fell flat for me","481":"wanted to like it more great idea for a plot but it fell short perhaps i was not quite vested in the main character","482":"very interesting idea i wish the ending was a little more thrilling","483":" you are one of them by elliot holt comes at a perfect time for fans of the critically acclaimed and popular fx television series the americans in fact it was an interview with holt regarding that tv show that influenced my choosing this novel sarah our narrator grew up in washington d c and her best friend jenny through an idea that sarah originates is given the opportunity to visit cold war russia this provides instant fame for jenny and envy for sarah the two grow apart ten years later in the early 1990s sarah visits the now open russia and begins to investigate some mysteries around her old friend jenny i'm being vague here because i don't want to give the plot away the novel is about an interesting topic and time in history as well as a fairly quick read as a narrator sarah is engaging and the reader becomes easily interested in her story but once sarah gets to russia to find answers about jenny the novel seems to lose traction and the plot becomes somewhat confused there are suddenly passages referring to an unhappy love affair that happens in the future to which sarah relates her feelings of being abandoned by jenny i found the ending very unsatisfying for an engrossing look at the cold war and russia under stalin's reign i highly recommend the trilogy by tom rob smith child 44 the secret speech and agent 6","484":"loved it wonderfully descriptive yet subtle i was only slightly disappointed by the ending","485":"i devoured this book while being home sick good story great writing and interesting premises i knew almost nothing about it and sometimes i prefer books when i have no expectations","486":"is childhood friend jennifer jones dead or not this is the question facing sarah zuckerman the premise of this book seems so slender yet it is one of those books which will occupy one's mind long after finishing it holt captures so poignantly the throes of girlhood friendships the small cruelties along with the joys of everyday life when your best friend lives across the street this friendship and its betrayal anchors the rest of the story which traces the emergence of self for sarah she travels far to shuck her long held feelings of desertion this is a cleverly layered novel and beautifully realized one too","487":"4 5 stars review here","488":"this story is set in the 80's and it was a strange experience to read about someone slightly younger than i am who grew up with such a different set of concerns fear and loss are two major themes and it is largely set in moscow overall the tone is rather dark","489":"such an interesting plot that takes you on a quest to find someone that may or may not still be alive if you like the tv show the americans this has the same russian spies living next door vibe","490":" i read you are one of them while traveling so i haven't had a chance to write a review nor did i manage to note some of the lines that really made this book shine for me i'll have to re read it i guess holt is a great storyteller who took me right back to the 1980s and '90s when i studied russian in college so much felt so familiar and i laughed out loud at some of the stories involving the russian language i read you are one of them right after reading claire messud's the woman upstairs and have been talking about both of them together a lot though they are very different books both are about women grieving and navigating that grief this book will be great for book groups especially given how it ends there is so much room for discussion can't wait to see what we get next from holt","491":"fast fun read about a girl and her childhood bf story takes a couple turns you don't expect but it's all interesting without involving a murder needed a break from the gore","492":" 3 5 stars overall a solid book with just enough twistiness to it to keep me interested part 2 is far far better than part 1 while the depiction of cracker white nw dc was spot on holt's descriptions and characterizations really shine once sarah gets to moscow especially in depicting the various levels of english speaking in svetlana et al still though i found myself wanting more out of the story than there was and the writing at times had the overly straightforward quality that you often see when copywriters like holt try fiction","493":"how we let others define ourselves how we let these feelings follow us for the rest of our lives is pretty amazing this book takes that concept and applies it to the two female protagonist we only really meet one since the other who has died or so we are led to believe this really isn't a mystery or a thriller i found that i quickly forgot what the book was about shortly after i finished it","494":"oh wow this book was awful it was tedious it was boring it led me along with the promise of a twist that it did not really deliver don't bother","495":"this was a book i kept thinking i would lose interest in but i could not stop reading it so go figure the nature of childhood friendships deception and finding yourself with adult friends all things that keep me reading this would have been a great book club book short quick and a little mystery at the end","496":"boring","497":"this was not what i expected i figured it would be one of those books i would push through because people say its a book to read but it ended up being a very thoughtful memorable and enjoyable book","498":"although the narrator's character is tedious at times i couldn't put this book down hopefully this isn't the last novel by elliot holt she is a great writer","499":"good story especially if you grew up during cold war interesting reading about russia after regan","500":" seventh continent the hungry duck cafe margarita propaganda if you lived as an expat in moscow in the 1990s you've been to all these places if you left you probably haven't thought of them in years but suddenly there they are again the plot of this book an american woman travels to moscow to search for her missing reportedly dead friend is enough to keep anyone reading the details however brought with them a whole host of other associations for me and made it a book well worth reading and re reading one of the best of 2013 http nvcltopshelf com 2013 12 19 pa","501":"sarah zuckerman and jenny jones live in an upscale part of washington dc in the politically charged 1980's sarah is shy a wary product of an unhappy home while jenny is an all american girl who is seemingly living with perfect parents the two ten year old girls write letters to the soviet premier yuri andropov asking for peace only jenny's letter gets a response and sarah is left behind when jenny accepts an invitation from the kremlin to visit the ussr jenny becomes a celebrity and soon the girls start drifting apart the girls icy relationship has not thawed when jenny and her parents die in a plane crash in 1985 ten years later sarah receives a mysterious letter from moscow suggesting that jenny's death might have been a hoax sarah sets out in search of the truth","502":"quick read interesting idea and main character my age so all cultural time elements made perfect sense","503":"good for a first novel and an interesting plot also holt captured aspects of an early 80s childhood that i remember some of the characters didn't come alive for me such as sarah's mom things picked up when she went to russia","504":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book right up until the end about 30 pages before it actually lots of great nuanced writing character development the story traces two key periods of my life personally childhood in the early 80's and ex pat living in russia in the mid 1990's both very unique and it felt like i was right back there the premise of the book is a big spy mystery but in a more laid back mellow way because it really focuses on the childhood friendship of two girls whose friendship ultimately i liked this book right up until the end about 30 pages before it actually lots of great nuanced writing character development the story traces two key periods of my life personally childhood in the early 80's and ex pat living in russia in the mid 1990's both very unique and it felt like i was right back there the premise of the book is a big spy mystery but in a more laid back mellow way because it really focuses on the childhood friendship of two girls whose friendship ultimately was undone by end of cold war cia kgb maneuvering with the friendship at the center of the book's focus and the main character's desire to track down a lead on a bizarre turn to her friend's untimely demise i did not expect to get some kind of big happy ending but the author just did not see through her premise to the end the american girl now an adult goes to moscow to find the truth the book quickly moves through several months of waiting and sightseeing and job hunting during which time this girl sarah mostly hangs out with fellow ex pats in her search for the truth she befriends a few real russians at this point the story unravels after sarah launches several critiques of ex pats who don't take advantage of exploring the culture and community they're in the author does the same thing and quickly abandons any effort to dig any deeper than superficial character development and story line when the truth is finally revealed maybe it is part of the book's coming of age objective that there is no need to do so but having gone so far in the other direction for the book's entirety the stark abandonment of the underlying story was extremely jarring having discovered the secret of what happened sarah moves on quickly to closing that chapter of her life that for decades had apparently consumed it felt like the author felt the need to get the hell out of dodge once she learned how much she had overinvested in this mystery without giving any credit for the pretty good mystery she had created oh well at least i liked the first 260 pages more","505":"i found the book great on atmosphere but thin on plot will be interested to see what she does next though","506":" four and a half stars this brought back lots of memories for me i am almost the same age as sarah and grew up very close to dc where she lived in the 80's sarah and her good friend jenny are growing up in the political environment of the cold war where the news always centers around the soviet union i remember this myself and it was so interesting to read and remember not to mention all the games they played that i did myself as well as the music and tv and clothes they referenced which really gave me a fun ride down memory lane when the girls write letters to yuri andropov asking him to please not start nuclear war jenny's letter is published and she and her family are asked to visit the soviet union as a gesture of friendliness and peace between nations jenny rises to fame leaving sarah in her wake which causes a rift between the girls a year later jenny and her parents are killed in a plane crash but no bodies were ever found after college sarah receives an e mail from svetlana a girl jenny met on her trip to the soviet union ten years ago svetlana questions jenny's death was it all staged did the family actually defect is her lost friend still alive sarah travels to moscow to figure out the truth but instead of finding answers the situation becomes murkier this is a fascinating novel of spies defecting friendship and learning to trust in oneself it's about gaining confidence becoming independently strong and taking risks i found this to be a spectacular debut novel different than anything i've read before definitely a fresh take that will make you think and reminisce and question i will be keeping an eye out for more work by elliott holt","507":"i had a strange reaction to this novel it's a fascinating premise -- two american girls in the early 1980s write letters to yuri andropov one gets to go to moscow to meet him and becomes famous then she dies in a plane crash a few years later and the other girls tries to find out what really happened i loved this book while i was reading it -- especially the middle section of the novel taking place in the mid 1990s when the second girl travels to moscow to try to find out what happened to her friend perhaps she's actually still alive but this short novel felt way too short and frankly a bit slight i wanted much more of it and the big reveal is revealed in a conversation which seemed like a missed narrative opportunity many readers have loved this novel -- it even found it's way on to a few best of 2013 lists i liked it well enough i just wish there were more to it","508":"my favorite part was a roller coaster ride and my quibble is that it is too weighted down with cultural references of the 1980s but overall a well written story i'd probably have bumped it to 3 5 stars if given the option","509":"i really loved this book up until the last few chapters it left me feeling like it was a whole lot of suspense building and very little resolution but in a lot of ways i think that was kind of the point overall this is a well written thought provoking book and i'm glad i stumbled upon it","510":"spoiler alert ambiguous ending many things in life don't necessarily wrap up in a tidy narrative arch and much goes unresolved however not to give too much away but figuring out if your long dead childhood friend is still alive or you're just being scammed seems like something a person would try to figure out especially if you took tje time to go to moscow for a few months c'est la vie","511":"my favorite book of 2013","512":"i think i might have enjoyed this a lot more if i had lived during the cold war","513":"i found the story interesting for me the second part which ought to have been the more suspenseful section lagged somewhat i found svetlana's demeanor and constant baiting and defensiveness tiresome and came to dislike all of the episodes involving her the narrative sometimes felt as if it were accommodating all of holt's firsthand experiences of russia the details about russian habits and appearances e g rather than being propelled forward by the story itself nevertheless i thought the ending was strong and i think holt is a gifted writer though this novel was perhaps praised a bit extravagantly one blurb compares her to alice munro e g","514":"i'd give this 3 5 if i could it definitely kept my interest and was a good different story","515":"an interesting story about two young girls very different in the way they live and think one goes to russia and later disappears believe to be dead the other missing her friend until she goes to russia to find answers","516":"great idea falls a little short in the last 100 pages the main character lacks some development but it reads well earning 3 stars","517":" during the height of the cold war preteen d c native sarah's best friend jenny becomes a media sensation when she is invited to visit russia by the soviet premier after writing him a letter asking him not to bomb the us jenny's sudden fame causes a rift between the two and they slowly grow apart when jenny and her parents are later killed in a plane crash sarah finds herself stalled in the past nostalgic and resentful at the same time years later a post college sarah recieves a strange email from russia implying that jenny isn't dead she sets off for moscow to track down the truth i'm glad i stuck with this one after a first half with a slightly irksome overly precocious childhood persona the rest of the book built to a solid and interesting pageturner intriguing exploration of the nature of truth and letting oneself be defined by past relationships","518":" the tale in this thoroughly enjoyable novel belongs to its first person narrator sarah zuckerman a hapless young girl whose family is haunted and torn apart by the specter of an older sister who died sarah zuckerman befriends her new neighbor jenny jones and all around all american girl for years sarah whose mother is mostly agoraphobic and whose father has left for his native england finds comfort and acceptance as part of her best friend's family on the cusp of adolescence and its attendant games of popularity that threaten to tear them apart sarah decides one day to write a letter to yuri andropov the soviet premier of the ussr jenny also writes a letter--but hers receives an answer and she and her family are invited to travel to the soviet union upon her return jenny becomes a national celebrity appearing on talk shows and at speaking engagements for several years until she and her parents are killed en route to an engagement in maine almost ten years later sarah receives a mysterious letter from a russian woman who hints that jenny might not have died in the plane crash after all since jenny's death sarah has helped her mother to run a foundation dedicated to her memory and has still never really come to terms with what happened so she decides to travel to russia to see if she can finally uncover the truth i expected more of a political thriller when i picked this up but truly this is a coming of age story about friendship told in a charming and original way while the book has a real mystery at its heart--what happened to jenny --it also considers the mysteries of friendship why we are drawn to certain people why we often rely so much on others to define who we are","519":" my husband is a little obsessed with russia right now so i liked that this book gave me a glimpse into a teeny bit of russian culture it's set partly in moscow around 1995 and the perspective of the city made me never want to live there unless it's changed for the better in the past 15 years as for the story it was engaging enough that i stuck with it but my appetite for it was much less than voracious i feel really so so about it not totally upset that i spent all that time reading it but not really thrilled that i did either","520":"not as satisfying as i expected it to be there was a lot of build up but an ambiguous conclusion","521":"a quick read i liked it well enough i don't honestly have much to say about it i was engaged in the story for the most part i read it over a mere 2 days so it is hard to get lost during that time","522":"it took a while to understand why so much time was spent learning about the childhood friendship eventually that becomes essential to the story i ended up enjoying the book more than i initially thought it was interesting to travel through out moscow reliving the areas that were so familiar to me u0026amp also reconnecting with the russian language i really liked the ending","523":"why do people start out goodreads reviews with a summary of the novel i understand when they're simultaneously posting it to a review blog but it's so strange to look at the reviews and see paragraph after paragraph of a description of the novel there's a blurb up top and i only need to read it once it makes me feel like i'm doing something wrong by not spending a paragraph addressing some unknown audience who is looking at the goodreads page for a book but for some reason needs me to tell them what it's about anyway i really liked it i do wish it had leaned on the more erm commercial than literary side regarding the ending but there were some satisfying reveals in there lovely writing a little bit of a slow start but very engrossing after that i learned a lot too","524":"this is a really confident first novel i wish there were more books about friendships and i also admire the restraint shown in maintaining the mystery finally made we wish to have a dacha","525":"i picked this book up in the library turned out to be fascinating it is about the friendship between two young girls during the cold war it is a good read","526":"i was lucky enough to win you are one of them by elliott holt in a goodreads first reads give away and received an uncorrected proof i wasn't overly interested in this book when i entered to win it and actually didn't enter the first time the historical setting and the fact that it was centered on female friendship drew me back on a second round of contest entries when i found i won it i regretted it at first maybe if i hadn't entered for this book i would have won a different one a better one i'm really glad i entered to win this book and that i won it it was a really great read set in the early 80s and mid 90s you are one of them is very grounded in a set of specific times and places it's one of those books where the era is as important as the location and characters a slice of history with emotions well preserved the essential plot of the novel is that during the cold war two best friends wrote letters to soviet premier yuri andropov discussing world peace fear disarmament etc one of those letters actually reached him and jennifer jones the grade school letter writer became a media darling andropov invited her to ussr as a good will ambassador and she published a book with a ghostwriter of course she was a kid and made a lot of media appearances until her tragic death with her parents in a plane crash her best friend sarah zuckerman is left behind she feels abandoned one more abandonment in a long string of them her older sister who died her father who divorced her mother and moved back to england her mother who has mental health issues she grows into adulthood but a letter from a russian citizen brings up a lot of painful memories when it suggests very strongly that jennifer somehow is still alive filled with hope with fear with who knows what susan travels to russia to find out what happened to her friend the novel bounces smoothly between childhood in washington dc in the early 1980s and adulthood in moscow in the mid 1990s it's faced paced and interesting with strong characters and witty dialogue holt does a very good job of crafting believable characters and situations i'm really glad i won this book i devoured it in about a day it's a very solid thriller with excellent characters","527":"this book took me back to my teen years with references to benetton friendship pins and being caught not knowing about pop culture the parts about russia were interesting however the plot moved rather slowly","528":" two girls one letter in the 80's during the height of the cold war best friends sarah and jenny write letters to the russian leader asking him for an end to the cold war and to the beginning of peace only jenny's letter is answered and she becomes an national media star and is invited to visit russia while poor sarah is left with her somewhat nutzo mother but then something awful happens to jenny and her family but did it really happen adult sarah is about to find out this was a good book but not a great book it moved rather quickly and there were some loose ends that were left hanging","529":"some books get described as page turners because they have nothing of substance to engage the reader and can be followed as easily and as brainlessly as an ncis episode other books get described as page turners because they bring the reader so thoroughly into their world and build up so much narrative momentum that the prose feels effortless even when it's rich and nuanced you are one of them is that latter kind of page turner it simmers steadily along as details are gradually revealed until the climactic final third of the book sneaks up on us at that point the narrative has so much energy that we're whisked along on a current of suspense and double agents and misinformation until the ride is over this book makes for a highly enjoyable reading experience and i'd recommend anyone interested in the 80s or the cold war or russia or childhood friendships or well crafted plots to check it out","530":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the premise of the story was definitely interesting and very timely with the release coinciding with the new show the americans but i was not very keen on the main character sarah especially during her stay in russia it felt like she asked all the russians she met if they had been a spy or if their parents had been spies during the cold war seriously who does that and who asks that question and expects an honest response this was 1995 russia still recovering and trying to emerge fr the premise of the story was definitely interesting and very timely with the release coinciding with the new show the americans but i was not very keen on the main character sarah especially during her stay in russia it felt like she asked all the russians she met if they had been a spy or if their parents had been spies during the cold war seriously who does that and who asks that question and expects an honest response this was 1995 russia still recovering and trying to emerge from the old ways even if you are searching for a perhaps not really dead childhood best friend i do not think the best method of tracking her down is announcing to every russian that you think they are all former spies and certainly must be hiding your old bff somewhere while i was satisfied with the conclusion i never trusted jennifer jones especially after she just left her bff in the woods that one time and i was pleased sarah finally came to her senses about jenny i was overall a bit disappointed with the story it would have made more sense to me if the jones parents had actually been russian spies from russia living in america undercover they were just too perfect it seemed to be a normal american family than to have mr jones turn on his homeland and spy for russia if i'm mrs jones i'm not sure i could handle leaving the us permanently and moving to russia if i'm jenny i'm probably upset about leaving my friends and beloved cat and while russian life might be an adventure for a little while leaving the comforts of america had to be difficult for both innocent parties jenny u0026amp her mother more","531":"i wasn't sure what to expect when i started reading this book and now that i'm finished i'm not sure what i got the book was well written and very engaging until the last 20 or so pages it's at this point that the story sells out and becomes a stereotype of americans and russian relationships maybe that was his attention all along but i was disappointed","532":"in 1982 two 10 year old girls write letters to the soviet premier to advocate for peace jennifer's letter gets published in the newspaper to great acclaim and she is invited to travel to moscow with her family to meet yuri andropov sarah's letter seems to get lost the close friendship between the two girls also gets lost as jennifer becomes a celebrity while sarah becomes an awkward and lonely teenager three year later jennifer and her family are killed in a plane crash sarah grows into adulthood still obsessed by what happened to their friendship and by the cold war that overshadowed both their childhoods she decides to visit russia - no longer the ominous soviet union - to learn the truth about jennifer's fate and their friendship i enjoyed this novel on two levels first a lot of it takes place in familiar washington dc locales and second i am a sucker for novels in which regular people recognize that politics and current events have a profound impact on their personal lives","533":"a somber look at what it's like to mourn a friendship 3 5 stars","534":"i found the end to be a bit cop out y but overall i really loved this all of the parts about how friendships fall apart at that age felt so genuine despite the plot the emotions never felt ridiculous","535":"overall well written i don't think i liked the ending too much i kind of feel as if there was no ending nothing was resolved","536":"a book club read based on an actual event thumbs up all around","537":"i was on the edge of my seat jessica's review really says it all","538":" you are one of them is steady keeping an even pace but it wasn't necessarily the thriller i thought it was going to be for some reason i was picturing espionage this is not to say that i was disappointed not by a long shot you are one of them was suspenseful i assumed that jenny was not all she was perceived to be and elliot holt put the puzzle pieces together perfectly i always smash mine in forcing them into unwanted spaces due to frustration this doesn't have a smooth edge but i know it's part of the border sarah's story was similar to that after jenny's death sarah is lost but upon learning her friend may still be alive she recreates my idea of a puzzle i felt she knew it could be impossible but was going to try anyway because there's a chance that the corner of blue sky connects to an unknown piece the descriptions of moscow were vivid and felt like i was in the dachas with sarah i could taste the vodka and smell the perfume of cigarettes elliot holt depicts a fascinating look at russia there was one thing i was confused about and that was the timetable yes i knew the jones' died in 1985 and the search for the illusive jenny is ten years later making it 1995 but i became lost on that journey sarah tells the story as a reminiscences although i don't recall her saying what year and thus had a tendency to forget what decade we were in until she makes a comment about email being new and the non existence of cell phones otherwise i was entranced by you are one of them it is a story of discovery of growing up and trying to pull yourself out of living the past elliot holt reminds us of forrest gump and his box of chocolates outstanding","539":"elliott holt delivers an intriguing story of two girls separated by the cold war and the vagaries of childhood friendship while the end is ambiguous to say the least the novel is compelling it offers a unique perspective on truth belief and the importance of moving forward rather than holding on to the past","540":"i think the narrator's voice in this novel is really well done the insecurity in the face of a brighter more popular less desperate friend but i found the ending ultimately unsatisfying","541":"not a classic whodunit but very good fun containing elements of mystery and espionage sort of an adult version of caroline b cooney's novels nice audio version","542":"it was historically interesting but the plot fell flat i

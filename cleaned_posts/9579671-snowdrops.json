extremely shallow it looks like the author spent some time in moscow and moscow is not russia there is a huge difference between the two which is not highlighted in the book listened to a few ex pat stories and came up with the book since it is not deep enough sometimes you encounter funny moments like one of the girls telling the main character that her father worked on an ice breaker called petrograd during soviet times anyone with a basic knowledge of russian history would have understood right away that it would be impossible during soviet times to call anything a name that reminded of tsars they renamed st petersburg to leningrad in other places the blunts are less obvious but are still present basically it is just full with stereotypes and some cheesy mental dilemmas the main character is having probably with the latter author was trying to mimic dostoevsky's famous work but if you are a mediocre lightweight boxer you usually do not take on heavyweight champions and if you try it just looks pathetic as does this book","2":"twists and turns galore and a feeling of foreboding flow through the pages of snowdrops it has an alfred hitchcock feel to it as the reader you know that things are not what they seem unfortunately the main character nick platt is taken in by the city and the friends he makes and he continues his relationship with them even when he realizes he is being used a quick read with an interesting plot and location i can see this being a good pick for a book club because of the characters and their many flaws","3":" i wish there was a 3 5 for this anyway a surprisingly good slow burner miller writes wonderfully about moscow and wintry russia not in a way that makes one want to visit however told as a letter from the main character to his fiancee before they marry the awful story that unfolds and his role in it makes you long to know whether his wife to be changes her mind at the end a 'snowdrop' in russia as well as being the lovely flower that emerges through the snow is an ironic slang expression for corpses that emerge from the thawing snowdrifts in the spring in the book it is also an interesting metaphor for the emergence of the main character nick's venality sexual obsession and weakness of course nick justifies this by exposing that just about everyone was up to the same tricks in the no holds barred post communist russia of the nineties when oil and gas and property were making anyone with an eye for the chance rich the story builds slowly but your attention is held by great writing witty one liners and a sense of dread you just know something bad is going to happen and the casual awfulness of the way people act is breathtaking i hope that modern russia isn't really as portrayed here but i kind of think it is anyway i have just discovered the book is in this year's booker shortlist it is a good read well written but depressing as hell","4":"the first thing that struck me is how the writing is so simple and direct as a first person narrative often is nick is hard to like but that's largely the point i think so more on that later masha and katya are colourful against the white backdrop of russia in the winter it's strange being introduced to them by nick with his introspective tone contrasting so sharply with the bright lights that he's describing the characters are hazily drawn and it seemed to me as though nick is trying to paint his memories with a lack of clarity intentionally a downside for me was a literary device that seems to be haunting me lately the foreshadow in pretty much every chapter nick looks back on his experiences and makes a comment to the effect of i should have known then etc you know the type i'm not against it as a technique as such but it was most certainly over used here it's apparent enough from nick's descriptions of the characters and their behaviour that there is something more going on than it seems explicit and frequent mentions aren't necessary and detract from the otherwise powerful message it happened often enough that i became irritated by it and it's a significant part of why i haven't rated the book any higher that said even though i saw what was coming the ending breaks my heart a little bit more each time i thought about it it's quiet and discreet but that only adds to the impact it's worse because i don't doubt at all that while it might not be true it probably isn't far off behind the glitz and the glamour that the newly wealthy revel in there's the thinly veiled underworld that's fascinating of course and i imagine worryingly accurate for me though it was nick's place in that underworld that intrigued me the most behind the oil the post soviet oligarchs expanding their millions and rapid construction and development were the lawyers lawyers that looked back on what they had facilitated and pleaded innocence the old it isn't wrong if you're just following your client's instructions argument nick isn't evil but he is wilfully blind which is almost as bad in many ways when i was an a level student i wrote an essay on albert camus' l'etranger translated into english as the stranger or the outsider and whether it's worse to be amoral or immoral this book brought a lot of that up although perhaps less starkly than by camus are the entrepreneurs that ruthlessly pursue rubles at the expense of lives and truth really worse than the lawyers that close their eyes draft contracts and arrange the finance for a couple of years before returning to the uk and pretending that they weren't instrumental in the whole process because at least the real criminals are honest in their way if you're looking for a character study or minutiae this probably isn't the book for you but if you want a book that less about clever syntax and verbosity and more about looking at a country in turmoil how that turmoil affected the little guy and how the 'snowdrops' ended up buried by the snow you should be reading this overall a compelling story that addresses a lot of moral and political issues without ever being heavy handed there are flaws admittedly but ignore those because really this is more than worth your time and i certainly recommend it if you're looking for something that's easy to read but hard to ponder read more litaddictedbrit reviews here","5":"ponderous and very predictable what makes it worse is that the author tells us it's predictable is he trying to make us think he's about to trick us","6":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was so bland

and realistic portrayal of state and personal moral breakdown the sense of foreboding starts from the first page","8":"i enjoyed this book although i felt the storyline was a little weak the descriptions of russia were well written and atmospheric","9":"a great fresh read a middle aged is lost in moscow and meets two russian women who offer him some temporary meaning very much enjoyed it and recommend highly","10":"this book is a very good read good pace brilliant descriptions of contemporary life in russia and a good story to boot you sense what might happen as the story unfolds but there's always a glimmer of hope that you've misread the signs","11":"this book has had brilliant reviews but i'm not sure why it has had quite so much praise i enjoyed it but would not rave over it","12":"well executed noir with a moscow setting","13":"another booker shortlisted book though this one has had quite a lot of press i've seen it on tube tunnels and billboards snowdrops is set in moscow amongst slush and state corruption the book is a letter of confession to nick's fiance revealing things he hasn't told her about his time working in russia all the way through he refers to this unknown woman in his present and with the ultimate question will she still want to marry him i'm guessing no we have three plot lines firstly that of nick's relationship with beautiful young russian masha then we have his law firm's business deal with 'the cossack' some of this was a bit over my head and finally his elderly neighbour's friend has mysteriously disappeared in the bitter winter these threads do not intertwine and simply seem parallel plots i expected it all to come together at the end but disappointing there was no pinnacle they simply serve to show that all aspects of nick's life work play and home are all drenched in deception the first thread is probably the most interesting that of nick's 'relationship' with mini skirt wearing sharp talking masha who is very much his junior of course we all smell at rat here why is a beautiful young woman stepping out with a foreign 40yr old nick himself is also aware of an ulterior motive he is no tragic hero neither is he an old fool in love he knows there is a price to pay and the narrative simple expresses his pathetic waiting for this scheme to reveal itself the journey to this 'revelation' is not mysterious we can spot how masha will sting him many pages prior to the back cover yet it is written with beautiful extended metaphor and a masterful take on hindsight you are transported to russia with an authorial flair that could only come from personal experience a d miller himself spent 3 years as a correspondent in russia the dialect is spot on and an effective tool in creating the strong personas and presence of the characters the choice to write it as a letter was perplexing at first nick expresses intimates of his relationship with masha that no fiance would want to hear 'stupid man ' i wanted to scream that the pages 'why are you telling her this do you even want her to marry you ' for that reason the ending did not have an impact i feel as though the final line was supposed to be shocking but anyone with half a brain could have guessed it an immersing read that transports you to another place and time the plot could have been cleverer but nevertheless it was something i looked forward to reading on my commute i have a bone to pick with publishers in that the text was almost embarrassingly large call me a snob but that instantly changes my opinion of content also the stiff spine was a nightmare when trying to hang fast to a piccadilly line tube pole is it correct to include physical aesthetics in a book review in this case it really did have a negative impact on my reading experience","14":"when the preliminary remarks mentioned evil i thought it might be interesting to see what that might look like in the context of an american lawyer in moscow in the 2000s he hooks up with two russian girls supposedly sisters and you can see where this is going a mile away by 3 4 of the way through i found myself turning pages fast and i finally gave up and jumped close to the end evil not really well you can decide for yourself if you want to spend your time reading this one","15":"very gripping story about an expat in russia who becomes part of a very disturbing scheme hope his girlfriend dumps him 3 5 5","16":"i actually enjoy books written about post soviet russia snowdrops read like film noir for me frumpy guy gets duped by hot girl not the most academic novel but a fun read","17":"really disappointing couldn't really understand the point of it being narrated as a letter doubt anyone writes a letter with descriptions like that and also thought the actual reason for his guilt was just a bit wish washy didn't get it dib't enjoy it but the descriptions of russia were its saving grace","18":"den me trabexe katholou isos na to xanaprospatheso argotera","19":"a noir look at moscow and russia which strongly resonates in a post financial scandal world","20":"wonderfully written story of russia from an expatriate's point of view when he lived there in the early 2000s a bit too nostalgic but i can't blame him i would have loved her too or wanted to wanted to love her for the rest of my life but she was a pain in the ass and russian and had a kid i give away too much","21":"a good read it seems that not a lot is happening so its worth persisting because everything is revealed at the end a book about right and wrong it makes you think about the importance of not standing by and letting bad things happen when by acting you could change the outcome evil happens when good people do nothing type theme beautifully written and constructed","22":" for anyone that knows moscow well all the street names will allow them to really envisage the setting for this story for me they were not necessary having only been there once for a couple of days told in the first person as an account to his fiancee of his time in post communist russia he paints a vivid picture of the winter snows and of course the bitter cold of the undercurrents of deceit and corruption and of his own failings a chilling psychological tale that was deservedly short listed for the man booker prize in 2011 it sent shivers down my spine","23":"if you are not familiar with corporate law then the book is kind of tedious the addiction of a middle aged man to a sexy russian girl and it's dangerous consequences is well depicted","24":"quite disappointing actually half way through the book you could already work out what would happen at the end the author is showing off his knowledge of moscow and russia according to his bio on the cover he lived and worked in moscow for a couple of years but it didn't amuse me oh well","25":"well written with some good descriptions of the moscow scene i particularly liked the line communisn didn't russia russia ed communism","26":" i don't think this will win the booker i was fairly certain of this in the first 50 pages where the prose was forced and contrived i felt and the character rang hollow but then as the story slowly became more gripping the quality of insight seemed to accumulate maybe the skill here is in the rendering of the hollowness of the protagonist if indeed he can be determined as such when character is limited you need a good plot and i am not sure that this really has one that i would call strong there is much that is clearly built towards and i did not feel surprised often twice for a couple of paragraphs what does this have to make me score it a 4 along with the barnes novel la then well it has atmosphere and it has a certain believeability of insight into character and into recent times it has a functioning plot unlike the barnes book but then lacks the skill in writing to fully ignite this reader so as i have said i don't think this will win the booker but then it oesn't read like a shortlist book does either and maybe that is it's biggest capacity to surprise","27":"made short work of this on the plane returning from vacation couldn't put it down","28":"not bad not great i felt like many other reviewers that the plot was just a vehicle for what the book is really about moscow the story isn't really all that important nor is it particularly compelling but the descriptions of moscow in the nineties are at times fascinating after a while though those even become repetitive i'm glad i read it and would probably recommend it with the caveats above but am rather surprised it was a man booker finalist","29":" i'm genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed this book it's by no means a fast paced psychological thriller but it is compulsive reading and it had me wanting to turn the pages or at list click through on the kindle the story is a reflection by the main character nick of his time in moscow as a young lawyer it's told by way of a narrative to his fiance which in itself is interesting given the events that follow he meets and falls in love with a russian girl and experiences the hedonism of a culture free from morals i think i knew what was coming from a very early stage of the book but unlike other novels this wasn't a disappointment the joy for me was in the way the story unfolded and the nick's response to the events in particular his thoughts and emotions it's a book about love or lust curruption and hedonsim i think the author did a fabulous job of bringing modern day moscow alive in my mind the narrative is wonderful and i can't wait for his next novel","30":"this was a good book about russia interesting and fast read i enjoyed it","31":"man booker prize 2011 shortlisteda d miller's snowdrops is unashamedly predictable once you're in you know what's going to happen and it is still riveting reading nick lives in modern day russia and by chance meets masha a young cold blooded woman whom he falls in love with he's so in love that he's blinded by it aileen donegan","32":"i think this book was one of the reasons this year's booker short list was accused of being dumbed down can't believe that a 38 year old attorney can be that self deluded the descriptions of moscow life was the best thing about it a slightly annoying read","33":"i was quite excited with the plot line and was one of the prize winners that i thought deserved to win though it made for a good read it was not great and was surprised on how the plot line and characters just seemed to plod along to the end if you are looking for a good casual read i would recommend this","34":" this is an ok book it's writing is solid editing was good and it flows well even with a few signposted timeline hops to supplement the clever way the story was narrated saying that it is bleak and from what i know of russia moscow especially accurately describes some of that city's problems this book is made by and hinges on the place it is set i'm not quite sure how this managed to get short listed for a prize it certainly won't be sitting on my bookshelf for years to come but it may be worth reading just for the description of life in moscow in the 21st century for an ex pat brit to sum it up a decent read but by no means my favourite of recent reads leaving a bitter aftertaste in my mind not one to read when you're down but when you're feeling like trying something different","35":" i picked up this book because it was on sale at my local bookstore i knew nothing about the book or the author before i selected it which i came to regret as i read i was surprised by how unmoving i found the story and how annoyed i was at the lazy conversational tone and unnecessarily injected asides it is clear immediately that the narrator has a confession but it also becomes clear soon thereafter that his impressions of himself and the crime he is confessing are only shocking to the narrator the attempt to create suspense and some sort of morality play just felt transparent and underwhelming so i was disheartened to see that this was shortlisted for the booker prize a few years ago even if one concedes that major literary prizes are conservative and involve concessions to popular tastes rather than artistic merit i was still disappointed to see how far my assessment of the book varies from the taste or decision makers but my opinion doesn't change","36":"a cynical yet endearing portrait of russia in the 1990s the language is powerful but the plot is a lot less interesting a mixed read","37":"thank you bob great read could feel russia and understand more about their way of life and thinking nice to have a good mystery as well","38":"a very sociological view of life in moscow the narrator who is looking back on his time there is mostly a reporter rather than an interpreter of the scene we experience what he did he had quite a time sex and business intrigues and even a real estate transaction he also describes the gripping cold he has fallen in love with moscow you can question his thinking but he tells a good tale","39":" three and a half stars what i loved the setting the detail about moscow and russia and the people i like the allegorical nature of the story the secrets hidden below the surface i like the title it worked on lots of levels i like the narrator though i know he's not a likeable man but he was masterly drawn i wanted to kick him so many times shake and tell him to do something it was as if he was infected by 'the moscow disease' very clever what i didn't like the idea that this was written as a 'confession' to his fiancee i kept thinking who'd have this guy i wish in a way the characters of the others had been a little more fleshed out but i suppose that was part of the book's style like a sleepy rendition of a country city and all that's wrong with it i found it quite frightening really that that's the way people live that corruption has such a hold that everyone just goes along with it others have given story details with far more eloquence that i could manage i don't think it's a thriller in any way shape or form it's much more a dissection of russian society an insight into their morals attitudes and beliefs everything in this story had meaning and i suspect i only managed to suss out some of the symbolism it's a book i'd read again","40":"a depressing read about a dull corporate lawyer getting sucked into a dark and corrupt world where the motive is greed joyless and atmospheric it portrays russia as a chaotic world without integrity surprised that it's booker material","41":"i read this expecting it to get better all of the way through and then it finished","42":"read by kevin howarth soporific i found it cliched and so boring to listen to that i've given up on it","43":" this book started well and i enjoyed the fresh wry tone but it quickly moved into the obvious plot wise and the patronising descriptions wise i've studied russian literature and couldn't see any of the majestic intellectual greatness in the 1d descriptions of russia's people and places times and tribulations a d miller ultimately reduced russia to a nation of crazy drunken clowns or silly old babuskhas as described by a narrow minded lack lustre protagonist this was the book's greatest failing for me even worse than an obvious plot no mystery and meandering narrative i couldn't identify with any of the characters yes they were supposed to be enigmatic i know and nick in particular annoyed me he was either a incredibly stupid b incredibly lazy or c incredibly selfish and myopic in the end i decided he was all of these and hence couldn't have cared less what happened to him b grade not booker shortlist material","44":"really well written really knew what was going to happen all through the book but did not detract from the story","45":" this book had some wonderful descriptions of post communism moscow and the way business was done and the scams i liked it for those and learnt quite a lot but the plot could have been so much more the characters were very shallow perhaps that was done to fit the story the narrator kept telling you he was telling a story which made it quite difficult to really engage in the story i was distracted by trying to think who he was telling his story to as there was definately tmi for a female but read as if it would be","46":"interesting little novel this one there's something about the way miller has drawn on the pov aspect granted by the form of his story to dance around the actual plot of the book and focus on the experience of being an expatriate lawyer in the wild east that sounds a bit silly i know but the fact that the book is told from the pov of a letter writer really allows the speaker's fascination with his host country to shine through every little russian quirk is celebrated from beautiful women with ambiguous familial relationships to the depressingly humorous sayings of the elderly the only place with free cheese is a mousetrap etc and the damn strange way in which business is done as the country finds its place after the fall of communism possible spoilers in this paragraph the story itself is open ended playing into the aspects of russian life that we see business partners disappear and then show up unexpectedly bribes are expected but not discussed that kind of thing i didn't feel cheated by the lack of complete plot resolution just like i wasn't disappointed by the apparently two dimensional characters it just didn't seem to matter in the course of the story which is rare not exactly a life changer but the way the story was told has given me plenty to think about","47":"well i came across this book by an accident when i googled something like moscow and crime and literature then i realised it was a man booker prize nominee book i was intrigued by the double meaning of the title and how snowdrops differ from snowflakes which is what comes to mind when you first read the word i loved the wit of the book the sarcasm and the honesty of the character but i found nicholas to be a rather weak man he admits that of course but it would have made his story a bit more plausible if he showed signs of fighting back as futile as that might have been after all who can continue to date a woman introduce her to his mother and not make proper inquiries about her especially a lawyer also i wasn't too convinced about masha's character the things that made her so special to nicholas weren't as convnincing what made her so alluring in the end nicholas was conned by everybody he met in russia and everything he believed in whilst there a d miller finishes the book with an air of vainness and disappointment which arguably describes the feelings of most people who lived through the perestroika and the version of democracy that followed call me a romantic but i have a feeling there's more to russia and russians than that","48":" being russian but leaving in the uk generally i am trying to avoid the fiction about modern russia written by a foreigner their view tends to be very one dimensional and rarely based on the first source so when this book has come out and was even nominated on booker i still did not have any intentions to open it but i've read a small piece in the economist by the same author about fictional meeting of the prime minister with the journalists and i liked it so that has lead me to the book this book made me angry but this book made me feel nostalgic and touched something insight me as well it is interesting because it is even not a good novel in terms of the literary quality the dialogues are plainly bad especially when the russian language transliterated by the latin letters the form which the author has chosen for the novel is very awkward in my opinion it is told by the protagonist in the form of a letter to his english fiance presumably he does not like to talk about it or even does not dare and i found this form unnecessary and even distracting and artificial but if you look at this book as a piece of the journalism it is very good his observations are sharp sometimes angry and very opinionated but very honest as well also in them the language comes back with all its power and hits you with its precision it is a story of an expat corporate lawyer working in moscow and his meeting with a russian girl her friend and an old woman whom they called their aunt the story is sad and unfortunately is quite typical also in parallel runs a story of a deal he is working with russian crooks the author seems to be not afraid to follow very traditional basic perceptions of an average foreigner about the russian women the russians weather etc but in the process he also creates a character of an archetypical expat foreigner working in russia his protagonist is a looser in relative terms who came to russia to get through his middle life point to forget for little bit who he is and where he is coming from and of course also to get a partnership in his firm which he would not get otherwise back home and his thoughts his views and his mistakes really speak for the whole of these moscow expats male community i think this is the strongest theme of the book for me the character observes many details of the life in russia which rings the bell for example notaries are one of the staple moscow professions like property developers georgian restaurateurs and prostitutes any russian who has power over you notary ambulance man waiter is obliged to make you wait before they help you so you know they can but in many cases the main character got to that level when he thinks he knows enough to generalise and he does it a lot for example about the russians they could wallow in mud and vodka for a decade then conjure up a skyscraper or execute a royal family in an afternoon if they put their minds to it and the incentives were right because' along with the fatalism and the borsch the snow is part of what makes them them and nobody else maybe to be this immoral you've got to have religion somewhere some decrepit gods lurking at the back of your mind gods you are determined to defy ... but the problem with all of this is yes it is mainly true and he got far to understand it but he will never be able to go farther to find the whole pinnacle of other things which the word russia and the russians imply...at the end after being totally complacent both professionally and personally he also realised that he is not that different from what he calls barbarism i'd somehow become the sort of person who would go along with it whatever it was sensing but not caring that it was no good fixing the forms and smiling so long as i got what i needed the kind of person i never knew i could be until i came to russia but i could be and i was did russia do it to him or was it there always overall for me it was great experience reading this book and it brought lots of memories i forgot existed oh and what a wonderful almost phenomenological analysis of snow so beautiful","49":"a slow burner rather than a fast paced thriller this book paints a vivid picture of moscow the weather the way of life the sleaze and to some extent the people because not everyone is who they say they are the more i read of this novel the more gripped i was by it and at the same time felt increasingly uncomfortable","50":"really good book but not the one to read when your daughter is about to go off to russia for 4 months","51":"nominated for the 2011 man booker prize this psychological novel is the story of a british lawyer working in moscow in the early 2000s anyone who's been to moscow will recognize the author's descriptions of the murkiness and corruption the police presence the crowded metro and the unhidden prostitution relating the story to a woman back in london nick platt eventually discovers his supposed naievete is really his active role in two areas of corruption the book draws the reader in slowly but effectively","52":"miller's debut novel is carefully crafted and delicately nuanced its softly unfolding plot and rich landscapes are its strongest features the novel's almost apologetic diary letter style is what holds together the less plausible parts of the story namely nick's unbelievable naivety this flaw can be overlooked by a convincing narrative voice that is clearly not stupid but rather willfully blind it is a sumptuously written literary thriller","53":" i did enjoy this book but my opinion of the narrator nicholas changed as his story continued when it is revealed very early on that he is telling the woman he is about to marry what happened in moscow and he threatens that she might hate him by the end he seems to genuinely want to tell her what happgened even though it's meant to be an honest account i felt that his confession was at times too honest what did he really want to achieve with this a few days befor his wedding he tells his fiancee that his heart is still in moscow that he believes his current life is boring and lacks adventure despite this it is a great read addictive and exciting a real page turner i turned the pages so quickly i was done in two days","54":"i was engaged with this book from the first sentence it's described as 'chilling' portrayal of the 'lure and horror' of modern russia a story told in the first person about a british expat lawyer who moves from naivete to criminal behavior so slowly he simply takes you with him from the beginning you know generally where the story is headed just not quite how i've read fiction told in first person before but this is the first one that i felt humphrey bogart was reading to me i haven't read the rent is too damn high yet but the premise of the criminal behavior described in showdrops presents a disturbing solution to another kind of housing crisis this author was a moscow correspondent for the economist so he knows what he's writing about","55":"this is certainly not worth being shortlisted for the booker prize it is not worth being long listed it is a trivial story dressed up with significance the main charachter is a lawyer who not only facilitates corruption but gets corrupted himself wow that's something we never would have expected a corrupt lawyer what's next a dishonest politician don't bother with this","56":" this was our library reading group's latest read and an excellent example of how reading groups encourage folk to venture into previously unexplored reading territories i hadn't read any blurbs reviews prior to reading and i must say this probably enhanced my reading experience as i had no preconceived ideas and didn't even know what genre it was it's more of a slow burning psychological drama rather than a swift moving thriller and although it does occasionally veer into a cliched view of contemporary corrupt russia i found it very entertaining and a quick and easy read the narrator is a most unlikeable character nick a british high flying lawyer working in moscow his inability to accept any kind of moral responsibility for his actions reminded me of valmont in dangerous liaisons - the quote from the movie ringing in my ears \"it's beyond my control\" nick would like to think we readers will pity him as he is a victim of circumstances but neither i nor any of my fellow readers in our book group were taken in by him the author spent time in moscow working as a journalist but is at pains to point out that this novel isn't intended to be an accurate depiction of russian society ... hmmm...truth can be stranger than fiction... we all agreed it was a very readable entertaining novel and it provoked a great deal of chat about international dating agencies as well as the stereotyped representations of different nationalities in literature - a good springboard for discussion","57":" very predictable but interesting story that is severely limited by a highly unnecessary metafiction device which really only served to detracted from what was essentially a fascinating potential plot property fraud betrayal murder a naive foreigner a dweeby fellow who loses all rational thought process when he has sex with a girl out of his league these are all real and explored plot lines in post soviet russia though these elements take a unique character and could have been a terrific story it is unclear why mr miller felt the need to write the novel as an unrealistic tome to a current fiance who presumably thinks her mild mannered low level attorney affianced actually aspired to be a document research attorney esp after a foreign assignment he is relatively unchanged as a person from the experience emotionally in the past and the fiancee knows little about him at the outset so implausibilty permeates the premise and it is downhill from there perhaps writers become a bit too clever trying to out perform i think mr miller should have told the story rather than weakened it by ciuching it in something else although it was predictable it is well written enough to keep one reading on on story merit","58":"interesting read","59":"provided a unique mystery of relationships with constant anticipation that something odd is going on discovering what it is and what the outcome will be keeps the reader thinking","60":"recommended by a stranger on the subway i am well into the book and loving it check it out i read this book and could not put it down i don't know what i liked so much just enjoyed every page","61":"the author really captures a sense of a place the seething corruption rampant consumerism and underlying menace of moscow the tale is slow and much of the menace is implied but it was a great read and was hard to put down","62":"not quite sure how this made it onto the booker last year slim and slight in both the literal and metaphorical sense of the word tedious main character who sounded suspiciously like the author various misogynistic sub plots too much world weary prose from someone who perhaps doesn't have the experience to claim it abject","63":"interesting characters and relationships and evocative descriptions of moscow but more twists and turns would have made the plot more interesting","64":"nick is an english expat lawyer who has been working in moscow for 4 years the development of his own laconic character and that of the people he meets is stunning the descriptions of russia are sensational all in all a must read","65":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was promising and intriguing all the way through but just ended on a blank it would have had 4 stars for a good ending but i just think the author fell asleep at the end","66":"thank god the font was big and the lines were almost double spaced this story is really about moscow the people characters are just props the real characters are the city and the weather and the lawless society \"the characters are flat stereotypical creatures but i havent figured out if this is an intended character flaw of the narrator or if it is the author's intention as an auteur to convey something deeper or so far hidden or if it just simply represents workmanlike craft and is what it is \" thats what i wrote about this book after reading the first few pages i've figured out now that there's nothing complicated here it's not even workmanlike craft it's more like the craft of an awkward apprentice it's as if the author a d miller who lived in moscow himself for a few years as a correspondent for the economist wanted to think of a story any kind of story that he could drop into the set of russia this is understandable since he had lived there and likely wanted to share his experiences russia the place is the main character the most developed and well described compared with the people characters the narrative arc wearily stumbles through the moscow cold numbing the reader's interest perked up only by energetic bursts of descriptions most often yet another way to describe how cold it was the moscow cold the moscow criminals the moscow daily life the moscow way of doing things these are clearly the real main interest of the author but it seems he felt he needed to create a conventional story that would give him license to provide that backdrop the girls masha and katya are set props dressing why did the narrator nick an ex pat lawyer fall so hard for masha there is nothing in the story not a smidgin to explain it to make it plausible did he fall for her because of her exquisite other world beauty she has hard red fingernails dresses like a prostitute that's it is it because of the incredibly hot sex and the fiery passion she ignites in him don't know there are just some vague tepid references to a bit of carnal activity occasionally slightly exhibitionist there's certainly no hint of any intellectual vigour not in masha or any of the other characters for that matter including the narrator there's no hint of any meeting of the souls kind of chemistry and without any of that the story just isn't plausible the book is ostensibly the narrator relating to his fiancee the story of what happened to him in moscow but it is a clumsy artificial device it is employed half heartedly and sporadically and so is all the more intrusive and annoying when it does appear the book is a decent start for a first novel but i am absolutely stymied as to how it came even close for consideration to be on the booker longlist let alone the shortlist","67":"i will reserve my thoughts until book club","68":"i was only in moscow st petersburg for 10 days but i could feel and smell russia in the novel and loved the descriptiveness somewhat cold all the same and not at all lyrical an odd novel i am glad i read it","69":" from the title one conjures up a scene of those cheerful white flowers that appear at the end of winter to herald the spring but the reader is quickly disabused of the notion that this might be the subject of the book in russia we quickly learn the word snowdrop means the body of a person who has died on the street during the winter and whose decayed corpse lies under a blanket of snow and not found until the spring thaw we are immediately thrust into the gritty side of post communist moscow where money power and corruption rule the day the narrator of the story is an english lawyer who thinks of himself as a 'good' person but who in spite of himself gets drawn into a property fraud scheme and loses both his money and his 'innocence' what he gains from the deal is an affair with a russian woman he believes he loves and some self knowledge the book is beautifully written and thoroughly convincing perhaps not one that the moscow tourist board would want you to read the moscow portrayed in this book is not a city i would want to visit","70":"riveting i couldn't put it down the language is terse but descriptive seems to perfectly capture the hedonism and greed of post soviet moscow","71":"this was a good mystery suspense book","72":"atmospheric read but rather disappointing particularly given its appearance on the 2011 man booker short list","73":"hated everybody but the tatiana the old lady just felt sorry for her it's strange that my feelings toward a character would influence my overall feeling about the book but i guess this was a special case because i hated the main character so freaking much i gave it an extra star to mark it as okay because i like reading about russia and the descriptions of moscow were quite good","74":"i had high hopes for this book but have not managed to get past the first 70 pages it was not what i expected at all and i really couldn't get on board with the characters at all there was no pace to the story at all given the amount of books i need to read for work at the moment i could not give this time to persevere and hope it gets better","75":"i loved the description of russia at this time the sense of place was really well developed and the sense of threat was all around however the main character was so naive and the 'bad' events that he was to be party too were flagged so early but didn't happen until well on into the book i had begun to lose interest as there was no emotional connection with the characters it was hard to feel for them either","76":"paints a very good and bleak picture of new russia although i felt the plot followed fairly predictable lines at the end i didn't feel as challenged as i had hoped and needed something to take me away from this austere place well written though","77":"i really loved this book but maybe the love is more subjective than usual because i like to read about post soviet russia in general i want to get a glimpse of what happened after my family left and since i was 8 at the time i don't really have the full picture of how it was and how it would have changed that said i find this book interesting for a different reason as well very often when characters are bad or good they are a little over the top what the author does here is let us in on the ride nick is an average guy with a midlife crisis and every one of his decisions is not horrible we get to see him go over the moral line one millimeter at a time i read some of the other reviews and was surprised at what a mixed bag this was but even after seeing what other people had to say i stand by my assessment","78":"it is really electrifying","79":"generally a good read which did a good job of highlighting corruption in modern day russia but it didn't always hold my attention","80":"great story tangible characters entertaining read definitely worth picking up","81":"not the most elegantly written novel but it has a great thriller like pace and fascinating subject matter a beautiful ending too","82":"another russian one for me was again okay liked the descriptions of russia and how it all worked etc modern day but the main character was completely creepy and had no sympathies for him whatsoever and whole premise of book was weird way of telling his current girlfriend what had happened when he was in russia and how he fell in love there etc would not like this author in real life no","83":"very readable book with a great plot besides thet a lot of nostalgy for people who have had connection with soviet union moral challenges in these times i have all forgotten about also opened my eyes how my foreign friends might have see things","84":" snowdrops are the dead who appear like the eponymous spring flower as the winter snows recede from the winter wonderland of moscow's streets except they are not flowers they're frozen corpses and the difference between blooming and rotting is quite a distinct one that even the most inexperienced botanist or ardent fan of spring watch would be hard pushed to miss none of the characters in the book are particularly likeable so you won't spend a lot of time sympathising about their plight or vodka soaked caviar smeared datcha based worries the plot is a little predictable but the fact that you've already second guessed the motivations of the principal characters keeps you hooked and waiting for the climax where you hope you'll be proved wrong a strong first novel which was very readable","85":" henry james used to complain that he was finding it difficult to think up stories to write about had he managed to relocate to moscow in the first decade of the 21st century he would have found an embarrassment of riches plotting wise it is not unlikely that this would have been the kind of story he could have come up with he'd have tried to make it a bit subtler of course but on the other hand the world in general has come down in subtlety a notch or two since his time the fairly straightforward storyline amounts to a couple of inches of newsprint in the crime section of a yellowish daily newspaper all too familiar to any russian reader and predictable to the slightest detail from the moment any plot strand is first signalled but the writing is so smooth and the expat protagonist's perspective on events is so involving that it's still mostly compulsive stuff until the last twenty pages or so when despite the logical conclusion some major flaws begin to tell first the protagonist's descent into villainy is not totally convincing what is well handled is his own appalled disbelief at the way he is being gradually sucked under on the other hand he is too sensitive as his narrative reveals to be entirely plausible in the vile part he ultimately plays what fails completely is the depiction of his relationship with masha the girl who manipulates him her character is so underdone that the complete hold she acquires over nick gets to be inexplicable she seems surly monosyllabic overall a blank presumably sex has a lot to do with it but nick can have his pick of paid companionship on less excessive terms it could have worked if masha could be demonstrated to have a certain je ne sais quoi about her but she isn't the great part of the book is the portrayal of the city and its people atmospheric bleakly surreal defying belief apocalyptic a good if horribly depressing companion piece to michael frayn's the russian interpreter both books cover essentially the same ground and while being diametrally different in tone in some alchemical way they end up in perfect alignment in both of them the feeble protagonists are manipulated defeated and ejected the russian quirkiness of one story and the outright malevolence of the other are facets of the same thing","86":"this was a great novel in several ways i think the city of moscow was really the main character and she was beautifully portrayed it felt like a coming of age novel which would be fine if the protagonist wasn't a 38 year old somehow this took the hope and discovery of a genuine bildungsroman and made it seem rather stunted of course this may well have been the author's point","87":"it has taken me two years to commit to reading this book the poor thing sat with only the first five pages read for that long it's hard to feel sympathy for the leading characters in this book as we never really come to know them but perhaps that is exactly the point a detachment from humanity helps us to forget our morals in pursuit of instant gratification","88":" this was a strong 4 7 stars if you want to go to russia then read this book i was in phoenix in august and felt cold from reading this book this book is about an english lawyer nick in contemporary russia who's moral compass get's tilted off kilter in his retelling of how things came about you can feel for how it happened so gradually with the condoned russian corruption pushing him along the slippery slope none of the characters were likable but i loved them all it is easy to see why this was shortlisted for the booker prize it is beautifully written with phrases that you want to read and reread and yet you can't wait to turn the page to have the story unfold an amazing debut and i can't wait to read more by this author","89":"the author did a wonderful job of creating atmosphere the sense of place thing unfortunately it was no place i wanted to be i can usually live with unappealing characters if they're interesting enough but not this time just too relentlessly bleak for me","90":" snowdrops has been short listed for the booker prize this year so i was fairly anxious to read it set in moscow during the post communist hey day of russia the story tells the first person account of a british ex pat lawyer who finds himself unwittingly embroiled in with russian violence and deceit both in his professional and personal life there's plenty here to keep this plot moving right along and the book reads fairly fast miller is exceptional at painting a setting you feel as if you really are in moscow while reading the novel more important is miller's examination of the actions we are capable given the right circumstances your hero in this book is no hero he's just an average ordinary guy who allows himself to be led down the wrong paths for selfish reasons and justifies his actions every step of the way at times his choices or lack of a moral compass becomes frustrating for the reader but the novel begs the question are you quite certain you wouldn't do the same it's difficult to underestimate the importance of setting in this novel there is no doubt that our protagonist would never have acted this way had he been safely ensconced at home in britain where there are lines both personal and professional that one simply does not cross but moscow at this time and this place play a crucial role it's almost as if the city is a character in and of itself very impressive debut effort that leaves the reader questioning how much the safety of our environment dictates our actions","91":" this book was given to me by a friend for christmas knowing how much i love to read she had read the book and gave the book high paise and i could hardly wait to finish the book i was reading to start on this one the story is told by the main character who is a lawyer from england working in moscow about his year there there are several storylines going on at the same time one involves his meeting two sisters and his romance with one of them the story has many twists and turns some mystery and many russian names and places that i could not pronounce all in all it was an interesting read and an insight about life in moscow","92":"when it was casually mentioned that the sister sat by while the had sex i lost interest entirely agree with bettie in that it just didn't grab my attention at all","93":"i did not know what to expect from this book i had not read any reviews but trusted on the booker judges to get it right i was disappointed however first and foremost the characters were cardboard people who did not get under my skin the two 'sisters' masha and katya were flat characters and nicolas was very unbelievably naive for a 38 year old second the tale was told as a confession to nicolas' current fiance this means that during the telling of his story he often referred back to his fiance and made the reader anticipate a grueling outcome the tension was steadily built up and i was wondering when the great coup was going to take place finally the story turned out to be a non event what actually happened was in no way as exciting or horrible as the protagonist made it out to be so the whole build up of the story collapsed and the reader was left wondering what on earth all the fuss was about of course the setting in moscow gave a certain thrill to the story and russian civilization was depicted quite colourfully i enjoyed that aspect of the novel","94":"oh dear how come this made it to the man booker shortlist in 2011 a willfully naive british lawyer in moscow allows himself to get caught up in a scam that readers can spot coming a mile away the characters are one dimensional narrator included and the writing is dull was its location a russia peopled it would seem almost entirely by murderers thugs prostitutes and fraudsters the factor that got it first published and then recognised alas","95":"the new russia as depicted here is venal ugly a place where no one be they institutions friends business associates or lovers can be trusted where the trusting or gullible and those who choose not to see will be destroyed financially killed or lose their souls","96":"good story the style of writing wasn't necessarily my favorite but the story held me through","97":" a moody piece i liked some of it i thought the writing was terrific the droll humor in his metaphors had me laughing at times not sure i bought the structure of the story i can't figure out why the author chose this method of delivering the story the protagonist was someone i felt nothing for in fact if i were the fiancee reading this confessional i'd have told him to publish it as i was canceling the wedding as for the predatory russian women women there have such a hard life except for the exploitation of the old woman i would have cheered them on get something out of the tough chauvinistic world they lived in exploit the exploiters i guess it was left uncertain as to whether the old lady was in on the scheme although i had no feelings for the protagonist a weak immature middle aged man i did find the description of russia and moscow very interesting don't think i'd ever care to visit the place or eat the food","98":"i really liked the setting of the book russia but i found that the style in which the book is written is too technical too calculate and sometimes you feel that you are reading the economist not a novel","99":"25k of his own money to two women he's only known for 6months and what a cowardly way of trying to get out of marriage i can't decide if he's a bit of a wet weekend or not enjoyed reading this certainly was an insight to russian scams on all levels how believable is another matter would banks really continue giving our millions when their is clearly a problem with one of the surveyors would a solicitor really keep silent when he knew something was odd about the house purchase and then lend PS25k of his own money to two women he's only known for 6months and what a cowardly way of trying to get out of marriage i can't decide if he's a bit of a wet weekend or not enjoyed reading this book but only when i could see the end in sight","100":"chilling sad atmosphere of winter moscow and not only because of the weather","101":"in snowdrops nick platt a british lawyer recounts his moral downfall while working as a corporate lawyer one winter in post soviet russia written as a letter to an unseen fiancee he tells her how he fell in love with a beautiful russian woman masha and was pulled half knowingly into a property ownership scheme while not quite the psychological drama that the cover blurb promises snowdrops is nonetheless a fast paced look at corruption in post soviet russia viewed through the lens of an expat who gets caught up in the possibilities the establishing capitalism offers it is atmospheric painting post soviet moscow as a city that is beautiful especially in its deep winter but fraught with danger and excitement in fact the russian setting is probably stronger and more well drawn than any of the human characters most of whom especially masha and katya appear rather flat without much to them and their motivations other than pure greed maybe they just appear this way because that's how nick has come to see them while the novel does attempt to build intrigue through the narrative device of nick writing about his past dropping hints about the bad things to come but it never quite feels urgent nick himself doesn't seem to be truly affected by what he had done and how he was duped i liked how the deep russian winter works as a metaphor throughout the snow thawing out bringing to light all sorts of secrets and nick's self deception and eventual realization of how far he has fallen the multi million dollar corporate corruption that nick's firm is fooled by and nick's entanglement in similar schemes on a personal level run parallel without positioning them along some sort of moral hierarchy but i'm not sure what a reader is supposed to take from these parallels that this sort of moral corruption lies and opportunism is rampant at all levels of society perhaps nonetheless snowdrops is a quick read and the russian backdrop sets it apart from the standard story of moral confusion","102":"really enjoyed this very interesting take on russian culture the intrigue kept me reading later than i should","103":"a good page turner slightly unbelievable characters","104":" despite not having any first hand knowledge of russia i felt it evoked powerfully the wild east of post glasnost russia and this is one of the book's great strengths the other being that the story is a compelling well written page turner the book is written as if nicholas the english expat lawyer protagonist is writing a confession to his fiance who is unaware of this particular story this device was a bit clunky and was one of the few weaknesses of the book nicholas does not start the book as a particularly moral individual he describes his job as smearing lipstick on a pig however his gradual corruption is extremely credible i enjoyed the way the book hints at a dark crime which as it turns out whilst still dreadful also appears to be by modern russian standards fairly mundane there are a number of vivid moments the extreme moscow winters the aggression and rudeness of the average citizen the horrible nightclubs the two con tricks one involving an apartment the other millions of dollars and the visit to the dacha 8 10","105":"i was expecting a thriller filled with intrigue but i was very disappointed the storyline was all right but not what i was looking for","106":"quite decent low key thriller that relies more on atmosphere and detail than a twist dependent plot which i quite liked","107":"whilst i enjoyed this book i kept waiting for the exciting gripping story to start and it never really did by the time the twist was revealed it was pretty obvious what it was going to be","108":"this book had a lot of promise but was pretty disappointing","109":"some beautiful sentences in here and a marvelous evocation of a city directing the story to a fiancee made for an interesting twist although the actual story of the dirty underbelly of theft and murder in contemporary moscow wasn't always well paced still i very much enjoyed this and would recommend it","110":"i was pretty sure i figured out what was going on in this book about 1 3 of the way through and spent the last 200 pages waiting for a law u0026amp order esque twist that never came turns out my hunch was correct though i had to plod through the rest of the book anyway until the narrator finally realized what was going on or perhaps came to terms with it","111":"dull and predictable","112":"enjoyable read fun use of metaphor somewhat rubbish ending","113":" this book is like a bottle of vodka you know that you're going to get sucked into it and it's going to intoxicate you slowly but surely you'll laugh you'll cry and then end up willingly plowing headfirst into a snowbank of a hangover and like vodka it's fun while it lasts the story is told from an interesting perspective as a first person confessional it's deftly told with some inventive analogies and pithy statements importantly it's mercifully short and brisk because i don't think that i could have dealt with reading any more scenes taking place in depravity soaked titty bars the main issue that i had with the book is that i couldn't sympathize with a lawyer who is so atrociously bad at what he does in short he shuts off his mind and blinds himself to what is unfolding around him any corporate lawyer worth his salt would have done much more thorough due diligence in conducting his affairs especially knowing what a moral minefield russia is maybe that's the point of the book but i just can't help but think that he got what he deserved for being an idiot and why feel sorry for fools despite its flaws i recommend the book as an eye opening well phrased entertainment","114":" props to the man booker committee a not very bright attorney working in moscow gets duped into running an honest old woman out of her apartment by two sexy and not what they seem russian females plot is propelled by the fact that this seemingly intelligent expat attorney simply doesn't ask normal questions about how people know one another and how they met or how certain obvious shady events even occurred in the first place the book keeps building up to a crescendo that never happens and the whole thing ends up being a very unsatisfying tale of a man who is brave enough to admit he was nothing more than a pawn in a scheme that could be settled by judge judy in less than five minutes","115":"written as a confession to his wife to be this book is set in moscow in the early 2000's and reminded me of gorky park it was shortlisted for the man booker prize and i liked the psychological drama questioning within the narrator","116":"nicholas platt is an english moscow based corporate lawyer in his mid 30's he meets and falls for the beautiful twenty something masha and her student cousin katya the novel is about corruption both financial and moral that the author imbues in almost every character i found this at best humdrum and at times simply unbelievable there are some captivating scenes of russian winter but the plot development goes at a plodding pace and the confessional narration device he relates the tale to his current girlfriend back in england is just damn annoying and eventually results in a dispiritingly poor ending","117":"totally addictive and after the high comes the low only because i've finished it read it","118":"dark addictive the main character draws you down with him into the web worryingly compulsive and beautifully written","119":"couldn't even get through the first 50 pages it read like a cheap erotica without the sex","120":"story was okay but marred for me by not being anywhere near as amazing as the snippets of reviews on the front and back covers would have you believe","121":"may 2012 book galsit was ok i kept waiting for things to get better i did have a surprise at the end but was disappointed overall","122":"miller's depiction of the minutiae of moscow and the life and character of your average ex pat is believable incongruously given that the book is concerned only with the dark side of new russia the detail is writ with a fondness that renders the book a love letter to moscow the plot is however predictable and the brazen oversimplification of russia near offensive","123":"i actually came across this book via a total mishap one of the things i like about living in london is that it seems to be the one place that publishers still advertise books ok so it occurs less u0026amp less but you do still see the odd enticing poster for a new novel or series and as a bookworm i appreciate such things amongst the humdrum travel alcohol and public service tube posters anyway last year i looked up across a london underground platform as i rat raced into work and caught sight of a poster for snowdrops in those snatched moments for some reason i thought it was a book about a man who falls in love with a girl on the london underground i was wrong so i downloaded the book to my kindle started reading and was instantly shocked to find it set in russia however this actually made the novel what it is the narrative structure is a man writing to his about to be wife about his old life in russia and the dark secrets he left there i find this element to it a bit naff and think the book stands strong alone as a story without needing to be shoved into this weird confessional letter format however that really only comes in at the start and end the book is well worth a read its a quick pacey one as you get sucked further into the protaganists life in moscow and the people around him non of which you can be sure he or you can trust the writing is very adept the characters layered and believable particularly the main character nicholas who is writing the letter and his pre 40 mid life crisis of sorts but the shining star of the novel is russia itself i have never been to russia but every line stunning description of both the beautiful the seedy and the absolutely hopeless left me breathless i feel like i have actually been living in russia for the past two days as i raced through this book and that says an awful lot for the calibre of this author perfect for a quick satisyfing immersion into another country and world","124":"enjoyed the writing style of this book but as little disappointed with the ending","125":"good read but you feel like grabbing him and giving him a slap for being so gullible it well written i suppose but you think no one could be so naive not to revolt against the obvious ruse","126":" the snowdrops of the title are the frozen corpses which appear out of the snow when the russian winter begins to thaw nick is an english corporate lawyer who has spent time working in moscow when he returns home his fiance questions why he refuses to talk about his time abroad so he writes her a letter telling her about his experiences the narrative of the book is that letter and what unfolds is the ever increasing disaster his life becomes after he meets masha a girl he becomes besotted with of course masha is not what she first appears to be and as nick becomes more and more involved with the dark dealings her and her 'family' it is fairly obvious to the reader what is going on but the book becomes compulsive reading as things spiral to their conclusion there arn't really many likeable characters in this book but the story is very good and the writing is excellent","127":" i noticed this book when it was shortlisted for this year's man booker prize and was drawn to it by the description as an intensely riveting psychological drama my luck with award winners is a bit mixed and i quite liked another of the short listed books pigeon english so thought i would give this a go the book is narrated by nicholas in the form of a confession to his betrothed relating the events of his last winter in russia he was working as a lawyer with the transfer to russia a potential shortcut to a partnership a chance encounter with masha and katya sets him on a path to moral free fall and sees him become no better than the many corrupt hedonistic individuals he has previously been so quick to criticise snowdrops introduces the reader to a bleak landscape populated by gangsters and prostitutes where strip clubs and young girls trying to snag themselves a rich husband are par for the course i loved the descriptive power the author uses to evoke both the tourist landmarks that were familiar from tv and magazines but also the residential and less salubrious areas there is also an interesting amount of historical detail and the older russian characters with their proverbs and stories from the past were very engaging there is so much to this book for example we see various scams that range from the small scale to those involving state bodies the narrative style made it feel very direct and as it was clear from the start that something had gone quite badly wrong and as the details slowly revealed themselves i found myself desperate to keep reading it was interesting to see nicholas as both victim and perpetrator and consider how he had found himself in the position he did i'm not sure whether i was chilled by the vividly depicted russian winter or how far things went this is a brilliant tale of corruption and lust and of moral decline on a personal and a much larger scale what a debut","128":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here what had happened a woman had sold an apartment some girls had gone away nothing had happened this quotation from snowdrops summarizes my major problem with this well written and often interesting book miller provides fascinating information about and insights into contemporary russia the swindled old lady is a sympathetic and realistic character it's even possible if challenging to understand the motives of the self indulgent narcissistic hero and his exploitative floozy but not eno what had happened a woman had sold an apartment some girls had gone away nothing had happened this quotation from snowdrops summarizes my major problem with this well written and often interesting book miller provides fascinating information about and insights into contemporary russia the swindled old lady is a sympathetic and realistic character it's even possible if challenging to understand the motives of the self indulgent narcissistic hero and his exploitative floozy but not enough happens perhaps this novel should have been a novella more","129":"this read like a first novel first person narrative to an audience of one some serious foreshadowing all that being said i read the whole thing in one day of traveling setting the story in moscow in the 90's made it dificult to put down","130":"a little let down by this i was expecting a lot more but then i had just read child 44 and the secret speech and though set in a different era of russia they had a better writing style to me not a great book and confirms my opinions of book award shortlists","131":"i just could not stand the narrator his poor poor fiance back in england the writer clearly had similar experiences and behaved as poorly as his lead character did as the only part of his writing that felt true was his mysoginistic and very un self aware attitude his arrogance and derision of russian people in general apart from sexy young catsuit clad women under the age of 35 because according miller they are fat and hairy past this age i only finished the book because miller kept promising some dramatic and awful twist i really tried but knew in my heart of hearts it wasn't going to happen just like kolya i carried on with a pointless charade because of my own self gratification and vanity","132":"interesting look at moscow culture miller did not paint a picture of a place i ever need to see or visit as for the story the protagonist is up there with the gatsby crew in unlikability i felt sullied and unclean after i finished it probably because the ending was no surprise to me i just kept hoping i was wrong","133":" when i fist started this novel i thought for sure it would be a five star story it is written as one long confessional to the author's fiancee through this narrative device the main character continues to remind us that he has done something terrible during his years working in russia i enjoyed this use of foreshadowing to keep up the tension the best part of this book was his depiction of russia which comes off as both seedy and beautiful for me the problems came up when the foreshadowing never seemed to payoff in any dramatic conclusion there seem to be so much potential in the build up that the actual ending was pretty unsatisfying i would still recommend it though if only for the world of russia the author creates","134":"a bit tedious unfin","135":" we want it in our soul before corruption finds a home there snowdrops is a hard glittering and sad novel of loneliness desire decadence and despair set in a cold and coruscating russia amidst its amoral climate its a novel of a nation's sinking into its deepest morass and how men can often not be different from the air which permeates their lives written with dry wit and a clear eye it discovers darknesses and deaths even as its protagonist despairs for life in a country where he learns that even falling in love has a price tag attached to it","136":"short listed for the booker prize 2011 i'm not sure what i expected from this but it wasn't what i thought it would be very good at creating a tawdry cheap and corrupt atmosphere this novel makes you feel like you've sullied your hands just by picking it up the books starts by the narrator nick beginning a 'letter' the book to someone you don't know who the someone is but suspect a woman and none of the details linking nick to this woman are known until well over half way through the book however most of the details of nick's story involves a russian woman that's he falls madly in love with and he into great detail about this affair which you can't help but feel is unwise if he is writing to another woman who is the mystery woman and why do feel that the russian woman is a bad 'un even though you can't put your finger on why i did feel i wanted to shake nick he is a slave to parts of is anatomy which don't have a brain he sort of knows he is getting into a bad situation but he doesn't really care as if he is slightly bored and quite likes being naughty the fatalism of nick and his anatomy is quite annoying at times read more on blog","137":"i found this book very frustrating half way through and i still didn't have a grasp on what it was about where it was heading even when i was quite close to the end i was still waiting for something to happen a very bleak story a book that paints a very bleak picture of russia and its people and in the end just plain depressing","138":"are expats easy targets because they feel secure in their status does the temporary nature of their contracts and higher than average wages cause them to be indifferent to the suffering of the locals and the injustices surrounding them the author does great job of teeing up these issues and letting the reader decide whether moral behavior is welcome or possible in an immoral place","139":"sad story of love and moral freefall of the corruption by a corrupt society in russia and of a corruptible english man it was tedious","140":"this is supposed to be a thriller i'm not sure who decided that for it's genre but i really didn't find anything thrilling about this novel having lived a year in south korea i felt the heart of the novel was in how he felt about himself choosing to be live outside his own country and the recklessness that can happen from being out of place however the entire plot was really not interesting at all i am shocked that this is up for the booker it must have been slim pickings this year","141":" snowdrop n an early flowering bulbous plant having a white pendent flower moscow slang a corpse that lies buried or hidden in the winter snows emerging only in the thaw nick platt is an english lawyer living in moscow during the wild russian oil boom riding the subway on a balmy september day he rescues two willowy sisters masha and katya from a would be purse snatcher nick soon begins to feel something for masha that he is pleased to believe is love as the snow starts to fall the sisters introduce him to tatiana vladimirovna their aged aunt and the owner of a valuable apartment before summer arrives nick will travel down to the sweaty black sea and up to the arctic and he'll make disturbing discoveries about his job his lover and most of all himself snowdrops is a fast paced drama that unfolds during a beautiful but lethally cold russian winter ostensibly a story of naive foreigners and cynical natives the novel becomes something richer and darker a tale of erotic obsession self deception and moral freefall it is set in a land of hedonism and desperation corruption and kindness magical hideaways and debauched nightclubs a place where secrets and corpses come to light when the snows thaw i have always had a fascination with moscow though my romantic idea of crunching through the snow across red square gorky park and the bolshoi are a million miles away from the corrupt dangerous ... city of neon lust and frenetic sin it has become jodie mullish's quote ad miller's mesmerising novel convincingly evokes a hedonistic seedy modern moscow a city simultaneously choked and lubricated with violence and corruption expat lawyer nick's account of his time there is rendered hyperreal with minute details of the rubbish strewn metropolis \" the author's description of the city's snow by the end of winter resembling a tiramisu with layers of dirt rubbish and right at the bottom an oily unidentifiable black goo just like the city just like nick and his story on the surface it looks beautiful but underneath from above you could see the chaos of entangled plots on the other side of the road and a couple of tough tethered goats and the glint of a frozen pond somewhere in the trees above them the sun was shining vaguely through the milky november sky old but strong in april - between the thaw and the jungly green explosion of summer - or in raw mid october i bet the same view would have been barren and depressing but when we stood there all the bits of old tractors and discarded refrigerators the shoals of empty vodka bottles and dead animals that tend to litter the russian countryside were invisible smothered by the annual oblivion of the snow the snow let you forget the scars and blemishes like temporary amnesia for a bad conscience some negative reviewers state that nothing of any huge consequence happens but for me it is the journey of a man's moral freefall during a moscow winter","142":"there is a quote on the front which says totally gripping well i've finished the book and am still waiting to feel gripped by it i found the story a bit lackluster and the ending very obvious","143":" i actually enjoyed snowdrops a lot more than i thought i would miller is clearly a talented writer and his complicated relationship with russia is both horrifying and oddly compelling nick platt is a well spun multi dimensional and bravely unlikable protagonist the russian characters have a little less depth unfortunately often reduced to stereotypes even more unfortunately these stereotypes are probably stereotypes for a reason i'm not sure i'd categorize the book as a thriller the strength for me is the beautifully atmospheric build up to a well and sometimes annoyingly foreshadowed climax miller's languid descriptions of moscow's devastating winter are definitely the book's highlights i have to say though the device miller uses of the book being a confessional letter to his fiancee does not work i kept thinking 'if my fiancee included graphic details of his sex life with an ex in a letter to me i'd slug him i know creative license blah blah but really there was no need at all for the narrative to be structured that way that said i still enjoyed the book thoroughly and would recommend it as a quick entertaining well written read","144":"had potential to be a really good book i started off really engaged but the story didn't develop great descriptions of moscow and life in modern day russia but kind of lacked in terms of plot development","145":"snowdrops does have something going for it it is a story that looking back did not offer much in the way of suspense or even consequences of any kind but there is something about it that is hard to resist there are much more fantastical hyperbolic stories that i have had to put down but i carried on with ease and finished this dark russian tale in only a few days swift reading for me it is well written with clean language and strong images unfettered by overblown description yet at the same time not hovering at an eighth grade reading level like some bestsellers one could name early on i was convinced that this would be a four star read for me but by the end i was left a bit cold by it all primarily the fact that i wasn't convinced about the city's role in the story certainly we have a flawed narrator that freely admits his obtuse western ness as well as his obtuseness in general but his memories of moscow from beginning to end are those of its sleaze corruption and death all very telling with regard to nick platt and how events are filtered through his point of view but i feel like moscow as a character was given short shrift there was not even an inkling of light to be found in the darkness the longer the story went on the more moscow felt like a caricature of someplace not really anywhere on this planet which perhaps may have been the intention but there is a real moscow and i'm not sure it's the one in snowdrops","146":" it seems like initials rather than first names are a token for success in the english speaking literature let's think about j r r tolkien p g wodehouse h g wells t s eliot w h auden and more recently to j k rowling this is probably what a d andrew dylan annus domini arkady dandy miller has thought while choosing his nom de plume if i do that if i omit my birth names and replace them with capitol letters then i have more chances of entering the pantheon of the successful novelists this expedient apparently worked when mr miller was shortlisted for the 2011 man booker prize with his first novel at the end of the day our a d was not the winner but managed to get a handful of good reviews around convincing even his politically correct colleagues at the economist to praise him much ado about nothing as william shakespeare would have said out of his envy for not being christened w j r shakespeare quite likely but let's not be too harsh with our a d snowdrops is as many readers pointed out a novel about moscow mr miller spent several years of his young life reporting from the russian capital and got clearly ensnared by its seductive grim flamboyance the problem with this book is that what our a d saw and felt in moscow appears only sporadically here with a bunch of good periods being blown away by one of the most impressive collection of cliches you could dream of what some gym obsessed and probably drunk reviewer at the daily mail called like graham greene on steroids should be read like a minor graham greene on sex hormones honestly the only similarity i can find here between the brilliant prose and subterranean tension of greene and the dull sex driven muscovite life portrayed by miller is the banality of the main protagonist a banality which is only apparent and subtle in greene but a block of reinforced concrete in miller nicholas kolya platt here is a pathetic odd person who pretends to be 38 years old come on he cannot be 38 not this guy and rummage through moscow parvenu infested night clubs as a british kid on a school trip being afraid that a teacher may scold him the literary expedient of having nicholas writing to his fiancee back in england about his russian adventures is awfully unrealistic and it seems like the same a d miller forgot about it more than once while the story goes on the catalog of unfortunate choices made by our a d is pretty long for such a short book and includes a bunch of unnecessary english translations just like this selected gem normalno he replied normal overall mr miller desperately tries to convince us that he did the real thing he lived in moscow not only wrote about it and therefore he knows what tak and spasibo mean wow that's remarkable not really normalno isn't it not too bad not too bad indeed if only our a d could have remembered that he is or was a journalist explaining say that the great patriotic war one of the characters refers to at some point is actually world war ii as called by the russians i would have been less critical with him that and the way kolya is mesmerized by discovering that the word sister could also mean cousin in russian after nearly 4 years he spent in moscow wow what a scoop but after all quoting gospodin platt i was on my way to being fluent but my accent still gave me halfway through my first syllable yes of course the accent but let's just report another shining example of mr miller's blatantly cheap style the one in which nicholas platt meets the russian doll he will fall in love should read lust with spasibo said masha thank you she took off the sunglasses she was wearing tight tight jeans tucked into knee high brown leather boots and a white blouse with one more button undone than there needed to be over the blouse she had one of those funny brezhnev era autumn coats that russian women without much money often wear if you look at them closely they seem to be made out of carpet or beach towel with a cat fur collar but from a distance they make the girl in the coat look like the honey trap in a cold war thriller she had a straight bony nose pale skin and a long tawny hair and with a bit more luck she might have been sitting beneath the gold leaf ceiling in some hyper priced restaurant called the ducal palace or the hunting lodge eating black caviar and smiling indulgently at a nickel magnate or well connected oil trader now wait a moment how many stereotypes you can count here let's ignore the useless translation of a single word put in brackets as well as the oxford comma and the evident fetishism for the hyphen 7 in 10 lines let's just focus on the cliches the russian girl looks like a bimbo therefore she must be poor therefore she has to wear a brezhnev era coat with sunglasses and those tight tight jeans and a half open blouse but being this masha a poor girl she is also unlucky therefore with a little bit of fortune she could have hooked the right pimp who must definitely be a nickel magnate or an oil trader and eats caviar oh really don't even tell me anna chapman c'est moi i'm afraid our a d only forgot about vodka a zhiguli a dacha and a balalaika ah no obviously all of this stuff is also included in snowdrops apart from the balalaika quite surprisingly perhaps our man in moscow doesn't like folk music to cut it short this book doesn't have too much to say you may expect some action but there is almost none you may expect some sex and well there is a little but in a chilly voyeuristic fashion which looks like exhibitionism all in all there are maybe three or four characters here who don't look like parodies but they don't manage to rescue snowdrops from dying down without a shake","147":"oh dear what a wasted opportunity this could have been really good an insiders view of corruption in '90's russia instead it feels like a desperate inevitable list of things people and events the fact that these are bundled together as a confessional letter to someone feels like an afterthought a way to hang it all together without any real purpose it feels like a draft rather than a booker nominated novel","148":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the book is written as a confession of the narrator to his fiancee they are a few months away from the wedding and he says that he wants her to know the truth about the years that he lived and worked in moscow and usually refuses to talk about it is interesting to wonder why he makes this confession then and to observe the perspective he takes on the events he reveals it appears that he's almost hoping for the fiancee to reject him after reading his tale and set him free so he can return to the book is written as a confession of the narrator to his fiancee they are a few months away from the wedding and he says that he wants her to know the truth about the years that he lived and worked in moscow and usually refuses to talk about it is interesting to wonder why he makes this confession then and to observe the perspective he takes on the events he reveals it appears that he's almost hoping for the fiancee to reject him after reading his tale and set him free so he can return to the sense of possibility that being an expat held for him he mentions several times that he'd never believed in long term relationships or marriage when going to moscow and his excitement about his upcoming wedding seems lukewarm his parents' marriage had failed most couples around him seem unhappy to him and he only had one rather unromantic relationship before moving to russia he explains that he thought that he could be one of the people who are happier without but then he meets a russian girl and instantly decides that she might be the one this is surprising because he knows nearly nothing about her except that he saved her from a mugging on the subway and they exchanged a bit of small talk and he got her phone number it seems rather like he projects all his hopes of becoming someone different onto the monosyllabic yet pretty russian he's met by chance his descriptions of his expat self often sound like he'd been hoping to transform his mediocre british self into a more adventurous exciting worldly man in contrast to many of his colleagues he's managed to learn quite a bit of russian and constantly points out how much more initiated he has been into this foreign culture than most of the other expats and yet he never quite seems to have lost a profound feeling of otherness he doesn't quite seem to see russians as his equals but rather observes them like a zoologist when describing his relationship with masha the mysterious taciturn woman the alleged family members he meets and the places they visit he always seems like he's watching from the outside congratulating himself on being so immersed in a strange different country and acting so very much unlike the married middle class lawyer that he always feared he'd become and yet he doesn't really seem to believe in it there are several things that confuse him that seem fishy about masha but he always chooses not to ask questions when masha has some odd requests involving a flat exchange that he's supposed to help with when some of the bits of information she's given him turns out to be false he still chooses to turn a blind eye he still wants to maintain his illusion of his new life and plays along even when that ultimately leads to fraud murder and masha disappearing from his life even in his confession he does not really seem to see it all as real events russia to him represents an entirely different world and the story unfolded the way that russian stories always would while he was merely observing and so the only regret he seems to feel is that this was the end to his russian adventure and imagined love story the only thing that makes him uncomfortable is his neighbour who does not accept the new russia and its realities as a given and tries to get the narrator involved he's the only one who reminds him that crime and injustice is wrong be it in russia or elsewhere as a results he avoids the neighbour refusing to accept that he may have a choice about the way his own life turns out in the same way he hands the confession to his fiancee and leaves it to her to draw the conclusions rather than making decisions himself after russia his life seems to have led to exactly the predictable mediocrity he'd always hoped to avoid and he does the same as before observe stay passive and hope for the world to make decisions for him more","149":"i loved this book well written beautifully sad","150":"nick platt kolya a mid thirties london banker who volunteered to work in moscow in the 2000 encounters a post communism filled with people looking to get rich by any scam they can figure out meets sisters masha and katya and nothing is ever what it seems story is written as told to his fiancee as a full disclosure of who he is before the big day","151":"uneven that's the only word that comes into my mind the author has no clue what to do with the characters or the setting it starts off interestingly enough with an intriguing premise but it soon fizzles out the characters are listless and events happen without any reason more importantly there is no atmosphere russia provides ample scope for vivid descriptions but the writer rarely touches upon it and keeps running in circles sorry to say but one of the few books that i just could not complete and had to abandon midway maybe i will venture it again","152":" i read this book expecting it to be amazing it was not although as its saviour it was not completely atrocious it is still gripping and i enjoyed reading it although the print is quite large and the book not very big if it was any longer i think it would have been too tedious and i would not have bothered this book does give an informative view of modern moscow which is fascinating and the narrator sees himself as a flawed character and this comes across very strongly although in my opinion i would say that he is only human a massive plus for this book is i liked how it was written the narrator is retelling what happened in moscow to his fiance which you find out early on and this enormously adds to the suspense and excitement of the book which is present but not in bucket loads however i think it ended too abruptly and i would have liked to have something at the end about what his fiance decided and what she thinks about the events overall i found the book quite enjoyable but it is built up to be over something amazing and i actually found that what happened to the narrator in moscow to be rather disappointing and a major let down not the thriller i thought it would be","153":"not my kind of book","154":"amazing albeit incredibly depressing story","155":" i'm torn as i don't know what to rate this novel as it's told in the style of a narrative there's no character development really and the reader does not get close to any character in the novel it's hard to feel true like or dislike of anybody as they're always held at a distance the only characters i felt any feeling towards and that was sympathy or pity were the surveyor and the old lady did i enjoy this book i think so but i didn't love it by a long shot however i did like the writing to a point i guess this is 3 5 star book in my eyes so now i just have to decide whether that means 3 or 4 stars 4 i guess","156":"great book and a real insight into moscow during early 21st century","157":" an immersion into the cloying atmosphere of corruption which was and perhaps is prevalent in post soviet moscow a somewhat credulous narrator falls for a pretty girl and then ignores all kinds of warnings and strange behaviour until he is pulled wittingly into an abominable scam to get rid of the occupant of a desirable flat so that some criminals can profit from it and from him since he must lend some of his own money to make it all look convincing perhaps it's a case of he knows he's already complicit through ignoring so many signs that he cannot turn back our suspicions are aroused at every turn but the build up of suspense toward the climax or anti climax rather is effective the subplot of his neighbour's missing friend is a dark foreshadowing of the main plot i did like the character of the neighbour and his far more wordly wise sensibilities he made the narrator seem really obtuse more than naive however nick's saving grace is that he seems best of a bad bunch at the beginning even the other expats are ultra sleazy or on the make all too ready to exploit the gangsters and sex workers they consort with daily whereas nick sort of sleepwalks his way into being used as a pawn in a criminal plot it all stems from his hopeless infatuation with the icy masha at the same time he goes against his hunch that his business deal is phony and makes his company liable for the cost are these really blind spots naivety or is the altered reality of moscow where nothing is as it appears too much to handle to succeed in this environment you need the focus and killer instinct of masha and the gangster","158":"snowdrops shortlisted for the man booker prize appears at first glance to be a love story nicholas platt is a seasoned and somewhat cynical expatriate lawyer living in moscow around the millennium the book is written in the first person nick is writing a 'confession' to a future unnamed fiancee and appears to detail his affair with masha a young russian girl however all is not as it seems and the reader soon begins to realize that there is something strange in this relationship just how badly things can go wrong on a number of levels there are three interwoven plots in the novel is not fully understood until the final chapters the writer gives an eloquent description of life in moscow during the first years of the twenty first century not exactly a description that will send you rushing to buy a plane ticket in fact miller's description of a corrupt and desolate city is often extremely depressing nevertheless there are gems hidden there that do lead the reader towards a fascination with russia and russian history two older characters in particular are portrayed with considerable empathy the city provides the backdrop to a story of deceit and intrigue that will almost certainly catch the reader by surprise despite the clues along the way the format of a confession to his future partner appears to give nicholas every opportunity to paint his own role in the affair in a favourable light however the author avoids this making nicholas a believable character not always likeable frequently weak but definitely authentic the final chapters reveal the true meaning of the title destroying another illusion that snowdrops are simply a beautiful and innocent flower snowdrops is the author's debut novel","159":"a dark thriller based in russia in its early post soviet era and shows take nothing at face value that nothing seems to be what it is and this book keeps you thinkign all the way through to the end well worth reading","160":"i really wanted to like this book but it was not one of my favorites i thought it was going to be a mystery but it didn't read that way the writing was fantastic but the story was a little too subtle it was worth the read but it wasn't incredible i did enjoy the descriptions of russia it made me feel like i was there","161":" i wasn't sure whether to rate this as 3 or 4 stars but settled with 3 as i didn't feel it was as good as my other 4 star books although this book kept me drawn in i personally don't understand where the psychological thriller description comes from i found the way the book was written from the main character to his future wife interesting but felt that the main character would have been quite insensitive given what he detailed in the book i also found that the ending was apparent from quite a way off which is fine but i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be presented as a shock ending and if so failed to meet its purpose overall not a bad book but i don't think i'd seek the author out in future","162":"atmospheric and yet low key thriller about regret and responsibility i enjoyed it","163":"one of the most inaccurate books on russia i ever read i can't believe it was shortlisted for man booker most russian characters speak in proverbs instead of normal language all russian women are whores all russian men are either gangsters or idiots moscow is a cold cold place snow sometimes only melts by june and the author had apparently lived in moscow for a couple of years unfuckingbelievable","164":"favorite booker contender so far i've read a lot of fiction making fun of russia but some of the quips in here are really well rendered and not just cultural slapstick beyond that i love the narrative framing and how he doesn't go too far and the simple yet elegant telling of what's admittedly a very common tale hollywood will probably grab this one by the neck if it wins","165":"you need to be pretty street smart and savvy to get by in this country if this is a realistic depiction of contemporary russia very believable story with well defined characters and a setting brought to life","166":"snowdrop n an early flowering bulbous plant having a white pendent flower moscow slang a corpse that lies buried or hidden in the winter

the main character is an exceptionally uninteresting junior corporate lawyer working in moscow in a humdrum job both he and his company fall for fairly obvious scams he's from luton which explains a lot the book is written in the style of a letter to his new fiancee i don't think so any comparison with martin cruz smith is misleading chalk and cheese","168":"i truly enjoyed this book it was very different had a great unique story to it definitely a book with substance","169":"publishers weekly calls this a saggy debut good one pw why it was shortlisted for the man booker prize i can't discern opposite of a good one booker","170":"meh was hoping for more of a mystery","171":"this is not a perfect book but it is a gripping book i'm giving it four stars because i enjoyed it very much and devoured it in a day for the most part it's fast paced well plotted and the descriptions of moscow and the brutal culture of post soviet oligarch culture in russia in the early 2000s is excellent however i did have a few issues with it 1 you can see the bad thing no spoilers coming from a mile away around half way through the book you realize that the jig is up and you wonder why the protagonist is being such a fuckwit pardon my language 2 speaking of the protagonist he sucks he's insipid selfish shallow and he realizes all of these things but blames them on being in russia that's part of the conceit of the book russia reveals the dark side of human nature lord of the flies style that we would prefer to think does not reside in each one of us fine whatever the narrator's still a dick and the whole premise of the novel that he is unburdening himself to his now fiance makes him appear even more cruel who would want to marry this person 3 the side plot about his misbegotten business venture is a snore maybe this is because i used to work in project finance as a lawyer so i know intimately how boring it is but i could have done with less detail about that whole thing nonetheless this book is very good and i recommend it particularly for the lush disturbing picture it paints of russia and russians","172":"atmospheric but there's not much of a plot to speak of has a nice feel to it but not quite deep enough","173":"a real page turner having worked in russia during yeltsin's tenure this book tells me ho wmuch it has changed since then in many ways snowdrops was reminscent of gorky park cruz smith well paced it is the type of book that i love to read","174":"i don't often read booker shortlisted novels but this one has changed my mind a thriller set in moscow in the late 1990s early 2000 it tells the story on nick a lawyer working in moscow who meets and falls in love with the charming masha but not everything is as it seems","175":"compare 1 the confused november sky reminded me of a black and white television set that hadn't been tuned in a d miller snowdrops 2011 2 the sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel william gibson neuromancer 1984 it's not the first line of snowdrops but it was enough to make me angry because gibson's line a better b written much earlier and c very famous why even try to write a line like that it's never going to compare well there was that and the fact that i didn't really find nick's plight if there really is any plight for him since he's not ever in any real danger very compelling he brings more or less everything on himself by taking everything at face value he admits that as well which i guess redeems him a little but if this were summarised in an askmefi post by his fiancee every response would be dtmfa also the first mention of his name is maybe halfway through the book after the neuromancer thing i wondered if the author was trying to draw some parallels to the great gatsby somehow there's nothing other than his name to justify that but anyway pretty much 100% not for me","176":"hooked quite quickly stay tuned and i'm finished i loved the tension i felt while reading it i knew bad things were going to happen and it was fun and nerve wracking getting there miller's style kept me hooked and i blew off some studying to finish it this morning so worth it ps it would make a cool movie","177":"pretty good but the ending was pretty anti climactic and underwhelming","178":"i would have given this a 3 5 as is so often the case but have gone to 4 as it was a bit of page turner with with what i assume to be rather wonderful descriptions of the place and people","179":"author took a risk with this because you don't like the narrator much certainly not by the end and it's much more about mood and psychology than straightforward plot but it works and it haunts you afterwards the thirty something angst was horribly familiar","180":" 9 25 2011 atmospheric provocative totally engaging but still i think too slight and unsatisfying to be a booker finalist snowdrops is nick platt's confession to his fiancee of what happened to him and what he did during his four year stint as a lawyer in moscow and it wasn't pretty perhaps the best part of the novel is the presentation of moscow and russia as an enormous looming force it isn't just a place or a culture it overwhelms people changes them shapes and bends their characters with its power corruption and amorality so while nick's story is ostensibly about his entanglement in a particular set of schemes he is really speaking more broadly about his own complicity in the schemes about how we was changed by his experiences and about humanity's capacity to tolerate and overlook as well as perpetrate crimes against one another nick keeps trying to work out his own culpability and how much he can blame on others on the culture on the long cruel moscow winter or is his behavior a manifestation of his true character or are we all fundamentally amoral a scary thought but after reading snowdrops i had a hard time avoiding it","181":"an entertaining read i enjoyed all the details about moscow and the russian winter not really a booker prize contender but a gripping tale","182":"more 3 and half stars","183":"although shortlisted for the booker this is not a great read it is a sad rather haunting story of how an english lawyer living and working in moscow gets rather willingly drawn into two nasty financial scams one is a huge multi million dollar scheme and the other is a small personal and with a very likeable victim the book is presented as an attempt by the central character to face honestly what happened to him and what he did the author paints a very vivid picture of moscow but it is not a place that this story makes me want to visit","184":"good tale of modern corruption in russia booker shortlist but very readable","185":"very accomplished but not the book for me overly descriptive and too little at its heart","186":"rather a chilling read not exactly promoting russia as a place to visit some rather clever descriptions e g a grumpy day readable nevertheless","187":"about half way through the book the editor must have fallen asleep as there were 5 typos in 10 pages through out the book the word different was spelled diferent most of the time quite irritating interesting if somewhat predictable book however i very much enjoyed the moscow setting and the dry humour","188":"brilliantly written chilling and too close for comfort a beautiful evocation of moscow and of the corrupting power of love lust combined with lack of self respect do read it","189":"an excellent read and insight into human weakness","190":"a good enough read and good on setting but not quite sure why it warranted the booker nomination","191":"a quietly melancholic novel that takes the form of a confession by a british lawyer recounting his time in moscow and the events that led to his finally leaving it is a very small and short book and yet i felt the author had done an excellent job of capturing a sense of post communist russia the light and the dark not a book i could say i enjoyed but certainly felt it was a worthwhile read","192":"'snowdrops' is often referred to as being a 'moral thriller' i was disinclined to follow that point of view until the very last pages the thriller deals with the life of nick platt an english lawyer living in moscow during the wild russian oil boom riding the subway on a september day he rescues two dark mysterious sisters masha and katya from a purse snatcher nick soon begins to feel something for masha that he is pleased 'to believe is love' as the snow starts to fall the sisters introduce him to tatiana vladimirovna their so called aunt and the owner of a valuable apartment before summer arrives nick will get tangled up in a powerful triangle of deceit cruelty and obsession so what kind of a person is nick to start with he is the narrator of the story he recounts his russian adventures to his fiancee in the idle hope that she will forgive him from time to time he interrupts his story to apologise to her already anticipating a dreadful outcome as a stranger in russia he seems totally innocent and unadapted remniscing of the pure americans and decadent europeans in henry james' novels no real empathy there i must say what is really shocking is that nicks has no regrets about his time in russia not even when the real extent of his moral betrayal has become clear okay the story is not very original or outstanding but a d miller did a pretty good job in his first fiction novel he manages to develop three plots at the same time the plot that we follow as as his audience the girls and their aunt a plot that is constructed on a higher level a big fraud case at work and a very delicate subplot that we are not even aware of in the beginning nick has a rather strange neighbour an old man with a cat for company who keeps asking about a friend of his that has disappeared he seems to fulfil the role of the greek choir in this novel he warns nick for danger in typical russian proverbs an example nick is running down the stairs eager to meet his girlfriend 'nikolai ivanovich ' he said holding up a single hairy finger i could tell that one of the russian proverbs he loved was on the way 'the only place with free cheese is a mousetrap' the odours of cat fur decaying encyclopaedia and ageing sausage escaped from his flat and caught up with me as i hurried down the stairs two at a time a second reason for reading this novel is the way in which the atmosphere and setting are set out the descriptions of the obliterating force of snow and the cosy garden saunas have a strong visual impact and trigger off a mental picture hopefully the effect will stay put for a long time","193":"not as good as i thought it was going to be but a good debut novel the strongest element was the portrayal of moscow it made me wish never to go there i'm still worrying about the old woman for me i could not forgive him and i certainly wouldn't be marrying him","194":"excellent well written engaging story about a single expat lawyer in moscow in 2000 i loved this book","195":"i could not put this book down","196":"russia is one of the places i'd like to visit someday if god allows it i want to photograph the kremlin walk around the red square smell the vodka on people's breaths and freeze myself to death in the cold of winter not knowing what it was about i randomly picked a d miller's novel snowdrops from the list of unread books i have well guess what snowdrop is a moscow slang for a corpse that lies buried or hidden in the winter snows emerging only in the thaw an englishman nick platt is narrating he's an expat lawyer who has lived in russia for four years he's thirty something and he works for international banks that lend money to russian businesses the oil boom in the world's largest country is making a lot of people rich nick is pretty much a single man he has lots of money which sustains his rather decadent lifestyle but he's lonely one day on the train he meets a young woman named masha wearing tight tight jeans tucked into knee high brown leather books and a white blouse with one more button undone than there needed to be even if she's only 23 years old she becomes the love of his life--and i think even with all the deception betrayal and hurt that came with her nick still loved her in the end i've read about russia in leo tolstoy's anna karenina and dostoevsky's crime and punishment i'm a fan of russian writers by the way there's too much bleakness and depression in their books so much so that the real world appears better somehow reading snowdrops isn't any different only that the russia being described is the modern day version drunk taxi drivers government corruption the hard cold winter that feels like forever a d miller takes the reader to the subways the russian countryside the bars and the streets where true enough some bodies emerge after the winter ends i haven't seen snow--a fact that shocked some russians i met when i visited leiden--but i could feel it through nick's narration i'm often curious what it feels like to live elsewhere--some place different where no one knows me where the sun is hardly ever seen like in iceland for example and it's not even because of the money reading about nick platt's ordeals and every day experiences has given me a vicarious experience of the expat life and i truly wish i get to visit russia someday","197":"loved the russia portrayed in this debut novel author is former foreign correspondent who knows how to convey the bleak winters and the decadence hedonism corruption of the oil boom years while there is a bigger picture the story is told through the personal adventures foibles of british ex pat milquetoast lawyer this melding of the personal and global is well done indeed will definitely look for more from mr miller","198":"i dreamed i was in miller's savage moscow after reading snowdrops the novel follows a london lawyer in russia as he falls for a mysterious russian girl masha but moscow is the main character in this novel it's mysteries are disturbing and i cannot seem to get them out of my head","199":" this was pretty good especially the central character of the book which was moscow but if you approach the book as a crime thriller you will be disappointed it is a bit more than that snow drops are the bodies that are revealed after the thaw that signals the end of winter the story is told via the narrator's nick letter to his fiancee he does not come out of the tale well his time living in moscow is stained by his involvement in a business scam and also a personal scam when he is seduced by a mysterious woman and her sister and falls into a seedy world of mafia types and property fraud it is not a thriller in the normal sense in that the eventual outcome is clearly sign posted and the reader is seemingly one step ahead of the gullible nick but he himself knows he is being taken for a ride and goes along with it all because he is in russia and that's what happens to nice middle of the road brits like him he is playing a role perfectly i suspect he knows also that his fiancee is probably going to dump him as well after reading his confession he is punishing himself deliberately but the reason why is a mystery not great but interesting","200":"this novel is written as a letter to a man's fiance about his single days working in moscow","201":"a story about russia and a british lawyer who gets involved with two russian girls he forms a relationship with the one girl and ends up unwittingly or not becoming involved in their scam to rip off an elderly russian lady i enjoyed reading this lots of interesting information about russia a well written tale even if the overall plot did build the story to a predictable climax","202":"a quick read well written character driven tale of the moral descent of one man","203":"a quick read intriguing it gives an interesting insight in post communism moscow through the eyes of a pretty boring brit","204":" the premise of the book is that nick is writing a confession of what happened when he was in russia for his fiancee it seems he both wants to tell somebody and he wants her to know before they get hitched just who she's signing up to love the synopsis that goodreads gives is pretty accurate as for the rest this was a fast easy read it was a real page turner because of all the foreshadowing i wanted to know what had happened however it wasn't particularly good or interesting and the gratuitous sex and nudity seemed out of place given the premise of the book it felt too much like a ploy to sell books erotica's all the rage at the moment it feels like one of my book club members disagreed and she might be right that he just wanted to really clue the fiancee in to what he was like it's also perhaps believable to some that he just needed to get all of it even the gratuitous sex and nudity off his chest as part of his confessional the information about russia was fascinating and i really wonder how much of it was accurate the author apparently lived in moscow for a few years himself as a journalist so that's promising the picture he painted was of a world quite incomprehensible to me and i'm a lover of fantasy books also worth reading were some of the insights into human nature and motivations i can't recall any now and i've returned the book so can't look it up but the author did have some fascinating nuggets of information about this that paired with the easy to read style means i may well read another novel by this author and indeed have added a couple of his works to my wish list this book though provoked very little emotional attachment to the characters was full of static characters was very dark cynical and depressing and left an unpleasant taste behind i wouldn't recommend it to anyone","205":" i really liked this book read it as part of the annual attempt to read at least some of the booker books before the winner is announced and was really impressed it is well written and the monologue voice is actually really compelling although part of me would have liked to have seen his fiancee's increasingly horrified i hope reaction to his revelations set in 200s russia it revolves around a lawyer his relationship with a local russian girl described in more detail than i'd have thought his current english fiancee would appreciate and a rather shady business deal the story is not hard to predict but i think that is part of its charm nicholas the lawyer and narrator is increasingly aware of the shades of grey into which he is allowing himself to be drawn and the unreality of his apparent relationship and we almost share his willing self deception there was the potential for a twist at the end but miller chose not to go down that route and concluded the story in a very quiet personal manner which i found to be really effective the story does revolve around that central image of the snowdrop the corpse dumped in winter covered with snow and only discovered with the thaw repeatedly the layers of the moscow and russian landscape are discussed as the snow covers blankets and hides with apparent purity the grime beneath great book","206":"i'm surprised this didn't get better reviews as i really enjoyed it it is a slow burner but that is what i liked about it i thought the ending was very thought provoking","207":"mmm not sure about this one interesting as didn't know much about russia before i read the book but i can't say it really makes me want to go there the book didn't really live up to my expectations as from the cover","208":" working from an office in moscow the protagonist a lawyer is an earnest plodder with limited ambition and a stolid personal life until that is he falls for a mysterious russian girl who with her 'sister' in tow makes him forget who and what he really is in no time he is rubbing shoulders professionally and personally with corruption in its myriad forms from hard line mafiosi to small time cheats everyone is on the make he evokes modern day russian society with an insider's perception he lived there apparently as well as the frigid numbing and incapacitating cold of the moscow winter a little one paced and slightly uninvolving i didn't much like any of his principal characters nor sympathise with the flawed protagonist but still a very enjoyable read","209":"an easy read and a good plot but i guessed what was going to happen about half way through","210":"meh felt like a one trick pony i did enjoy the hero the corporate law plot line and the russian setting however","211":"not sure why it was short listed for booker i didn't think this was much of a story at all i had guessed much of the suspense well before the reveal too formulaic","212":"this novel has very high praise as we approach the booker announcement next week great setting wonderful written and a decent story i heard it called a crime novel in one review but i think not for me it's not the best in the bunch for booker but still very enjoyable","213":"very disappointing considering all the hype about this novel i persevered with the hope something interesting would happen to no avail some excellent description of russia not enough to make this story interesting","214":"an interesting insight into modern russia but i not the great read i hoped it would be","215":"i liked the atmosphere plot seemed bit too predictable","216":"this is a fine debut novel nicholas an expat lawyer living in moscow comes to the aid of two young women who are being robbed he becomes involved with one of the girls and this relationship eventually causes him to do something he will regret a good read","217":"an odd book it was a bit predictable and pointless but the description of moscow was very good so it wasn't a total waste of time","218":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here absolutely pants boring no beyond boring painful just didn't want to pick it up no point to the story what a load of twaddle made murder at the manor an epic in comparison i give it a 1 unless i'm allowed to give it a zero","219":"suspenseful and full of sadness the atmosphere and details of snowdrops brought russia to life in my mind really enjoyed this book","220":"this book completely captured the undercurrent of moscow uncannily accurate based on my one trip to moscow so i cannot say that this was a bad book just not my kind of thing i'm not a crime book type person so i may be a bit mean with my rating here","221":"i thought this book was terrific atmospheric an extremely intriguing and well informed look at russia and a story that was at once extremely simple and extremely brilliant","222":"this was an interesting read mainly because i know very little about modern russian society i wasn't overly gripped by the main character but wanted to find out what happened even though i could tell it would all end badly","223":" i liked a d miller's style of writing with the easy sardonic wit and sarcastic analogies his is a style of writing that is reliant on the sharp usage of analogies to describe a situation or even to bring about a desired impact on the reader miller also gets the atmosphere right the seemingly accurate depiction of russia through some instantly and intuitively understandable cliches adds a haunting quality to the prose this is especially so because it has certain hallmarks of the hardboiled genre which have been suitably toned down making russia an interesting and unique setting for some established tropes to play out however for all the admirable qualities that miller's writing possesses his writing is uneven displaying the kind of scattershot skill that is the wont of a debut writer in that sense it is reminiscent of adiga's white tiger but miller's language i tend to believe is superior but only marginally so the plot is quite spartan if you think about it and the inexorable drift towards the ending almost begins in the initial pages itself because of this it is entirely dependant upon the conversations the situations and the russian milieu that miller manages to weave to sustain interest and take the plot forward in this he partially succeeds overall it is an entertaining read with a delightful smattering of conspiracy mild spoilers ahead i was disappointed with the somewhat naivete of the protagonist who senses like all the readers do a deeper murkier plot but does little to extricate himself from it there is this tort law principle of contributory negligence which states that a persons compensation is apportioned or reduced if it is proved that he himself was in a position to avert hurt but did not do so in the case of the protagonist he is definitely guilty of contributing to his own harm and i could not fathom why was it a sense of free drift of being in an alien land was it yearning for companionship or was it just a masochistic tendency even if it was any of these i wasn't convinced enough about the protagonist's actions to sympathise with him in the end","224":"a lonely 30 something british ex pat lawyer in moscow's wild east 2000s gets entangled in several shady deals and a love affair in which his native wit understanding of the culture and sense of moral superiority are blinding hindrances when the russian winter thaws the truth surfaces like the corpses of the homeless the snowdrops","225":"read the first few pages put it down not my cup of tea and the world has too many books nd too little time","226":"wow what an incoherent mess i don't know how this book made the man booker prize shortlist the plot is predictable and the characters uninteresting and ultimately forgettable mr miller's writing has moments of inspiration but on the whole this book is not a success","227":"the only place with free cheese is a mousetrap 26 i knew they might be taking me for something but there was nothing in my apartment that i wanted more than i wanted masha and i didn't think they'd kill me 35 ... but it was a long six months for girl of her age she'd grown up into her hips and lips and possibilities 116 the lesson wasn't about russia it never is i don't think when a relationship ends it isn't your lover that you learn about you learn about yourself 159","228":"a great opening introduces the metaphor of the title then the action falls a bit flat at first i thought it a naive and simplistic narrative but as the plot unfolds although the narrator is irritatingly smug and obsessed with sexual exploits i began to realise the richness of the story and his naivetie some wonderful laugh out loud moments and observations 'in moscow everyone with a dick and a credit card seemed to spend at least an evening a week shoving roubles into diamante underwear' not sure that the pre nuptial 'confession' works though","229":"i loved the context as i could relate the content to other russian books that i have read","230":" i loved this little book it had all the right ingredients to keep me flicking through the pages russian girls middle aged protagonist sex a white collar crime sprinkled by a great dose of the current zeitgeist in moscow which is captivating to state the least this book is great read for anyone interested in moscow life set in russia's historical context of war and cold weather filled with a healthy amount of russian narrative my best one which i found very similar to pakistani situation is 'they russian know the rules they can keep ripping their own people off so long as they can play nice to the foreigners '","231":"four stars for the author's depiction of contemporary moscow three stars for the writing two stars for the characters shallow underdeveloped one star for the plot that being said it is still a quick and enjoyable read","232":"this book gave me a very uneasy feeling to say the least chock full of weak minded people corruption and lies the sleaze and filth just ooze off the pages i've wanted to go to russia for ages but people have always advised me against it because they say it's dangerous and that you have to know which palms to grease to get anywhere i had always more or less dismissed this but this book confirms all the terrible things i've heard about russia especially moscow that's why i'm glad i read this to have a more or less realistic idea of what life over there is like since the author lived in russia for several years i assume he knows what he's talking about it's gotten rid of some of my naivety it's opened my eyes to what people will actually stoop to in those circumstances part of me wishes i'd been left in my ignorance though","233":" this the last book from the booker short list and it left me cold i could see that it had merit but it did little to move me it covers a westerners view of modern day russia i could see that the main character was having a rough time but did not care for him the other characters seem to be stereotypes the corrupt party oligarch come tycoon and the gold digging russian women i know these people exist but there must be more to them than this russia itself comes across as a stereotype full of corruption and stupid western business","234":"this novel's main character is moscow in the 90s or to be even more specific the weather in moscow over the course of a year this is a city so replete with corruption it's as quotidian as sidewalks i won't use snow for this metaphor although one might be tempted to snow plays a much more significant role as a symbol in miller's novel there's the narrator of course and his lover and her sister and their aunt there's the narrator's boss and co workers and clients there's a love story in there and a scheme and a scandal but few of these are as compelling as the richly textured descriptions miller offers for moscow's brief summer invisible autumn character affirming winter a source of patriotic pride and too short spring if you like the city itself is a symbol for the narrator's lost love but don't assume the usual metaphors associated with cold and hot you'll need to read the novel to appreciate the depth of the narrator's love for moscow miller bookends the story with a corpse symbol and wraps his personal tale inside another about his professional life symbol i mean it's no wonder snowdrops was shortlisted for a booker prize the guys over at cliff notes must be loving how much they can write up about this but forgive me for sounding sarcastic and cynical the truth is miller's writing is well paced and intelligent without being too languid or flowery the book has enough depth that i'm seeing all kinds of different interpretations from other reviewers which i say is remarkable you'll get out of this one what you want to put into it","235":"one time read didn't impress me much","236":"disappointing the main character is weak and not credible as a lawyer","237":"a superb account by a thirty something english lawyer working in moscow who becomes ensnared in a honey trap","238":"it was brutally addictive lipstick on a pig","239":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it's more 2 5 stars than 3 realistically the author is more a commercial writer than a novelist this is more of a beach read the humour alleviated the slow burn of the story things didn't start to happen until about 65% of the way through and even then the protagonist seemed to make a lacklustre attempt at uncovering the truth possibly because he knew it or didn't want to know i also found the protagonist alittle too gullible considering he's meant to be a lawyer obviously not very good it's more 2 5 stars than 3 realistically the author is more a commercial writer than a novelist this is more of a beach read the humour alleviated the slow burn of the story things didn't start to happen until about 65% of the way through and even then the protagonist seemed to make a lacklustre attempt at uncovering the truth possibly because he knew it or didn't want to know i also found the protagonist alittle too gullible considering he's meant to be a lawyer obviously not very good at due diligence and like other reviewers have mentioned it's more about living and being a tourist in moscow and the russian people than following a plotline or a travelogue depending on how you view it one other observation is that presumably the character known as stepan mikhailovich is the same guy who 'attempted' to mug masha at the beginning to cause the meeting between nick and the girls more","240":" whilst i generally enjoyed this book it come as a bit of let down with an eventual feeling of disappointment rather like some dates i have been on in the past the anticipation was not matched by the conclusion the various descriptive analyses of russian life its people customs etc were fascinating i found the synopsis didn't match the content the latter of which seemed to merely consist of a 'should know better' westerner getting taken advantage of i did like the ending though as i felt exactly the same way after 8 years in london except i didn't have anything like these experiences in that i started to ask myself what's the point in staying recommended but don't expect too much i thought this was going to be more of a thriller","241":" this book has a practically non existant plot line but is just filled with details of life in russia i think the atmosphere a d miller creates is the main draw of reading this novel it's basically a confessional as told by our hero protagonist nick to his present day fiancee the reader never knows her she's just a plot device he's an english lawyer in his late thirties living and working in russia he gets involved with two youg women and becomes ensnared quite willingly after a while in their scheme there's a moral dubiousness about nick that makes him a rather honest if not likeable character","242":"so bad i gave up on it","243":"very interesting read regarding the pariticpation of the victim","244":"my review may be read on my book review blog rundpinne","245":"this book will haunt you written as a flashback with continual addresses and references to the fiancee reader it details a winter in moscow where everything goes bad the narrator is an expat lawyer who falls for a young woman who he's sure he's in love with however there are continual dark references to schemes and cheating and you end up with the most dismal view of russian humanity they would do anything anything for money","246":"i read this in russia u0026amp could not put it down enormously powerful portrait of a time u0026amp place in which humanity u0026amp kindness are exploited u0026amp valued far less than pursuit of power u0026amp wealth the weather u0026amp the cultural climate are perfectly suited","247":"i know it sounds like an oxymoron but sort of camus with a conscience but not enough of a conscience to do anything about it i have to believe the fiancee to whom the book is addressed as a letter dumped his ass after reading it","248":"maybe i'm on a russian kick but this is the second book i've read lately that was set in russia this time it's post ussr moscow snowdrops isn't a thriller or mystery in the traditional sense but it's clear from the beginning that something bad happened and you're compelled to keep reading to find out what it's a dark and i sense accurate picture of post soviet life as seen through the eyes of a british ex pat","249":" right firstly i'd probably give it a 3 5 star rating if halves were possible on goodreads this a good book with a lot of potential to be a great book it just falls short in actuality the good points are that the sense of place and description are very thorough i'll admit i've never been to russia but for me the author did a fantastic job of creating a fully formed russian universe for the setting the characters ate generally very good well the main ones are the peripheral ones sometimes are a bit flimsy on detail and reliant on stereotypes i really enjoyed the format of a confessional letter based on past events as it was done well and remained consistant for the whole novel also for the first half of the novel especially there is a fantastic element of disturbance just sitting underneath the plot where you know that things are not quite as they seem not so good points from the cover image and quotes you expect a full blown crime murder rampage through russia and what you actually read is a mild and quiet meander into a fairly typical criminal cartel money based story and where is the leaves you stunned ending it's quite obvious from the beginning how the book will evolve there are no shocks at all i feel quiite disappointed without a shocking interesting ending there isn't really a need for a confessional letter so i'm left wondering what the point of it all was i will end by saying it is a good read just re align your expectations it is enjoyable as a well written book about russia but it fails at being a shocking thriller","250":"this book opens a window on a dog eat dog world after the fall of communism in moscow it was an interesting informative read but also one that detailed a man's slippery slope toward depravity as an ex pat in russia","251":"i was yet again slightly underwhelmed by a supposed booker calibre novel snowdrops is an ok read but nowhere near the hype you get ready to receive from the quotes on the cover miller portrays moscow's seasons beautifully making me want to visit but i feel his characters are lacking in dimension and court stereotypes too widely there was tension and i did feel for the possible victim of the crime however it didn't grip me or outrage me and that's what i felt it should do it's a read for a kindle generation if you have 5000 stored on a little machine it doesn't matter if you hit delete and move onto the next but when you physically own something having hunted it down in a bookshop payed a real person with real money i expect more than i might from a virtual world","252":"atmospheric depressing sad and kind of dull","253":"this wasn't a bad book it just wasn't a great book the book itself up in a way that left you in suspense for an ending which was incredibly disappointing the narrator's story was interesting though if you were writing an account for your fiancee about an ex girlfriend i'm sure you would leave out some of the sexual details it makes a good easy read just don't expect too much from it","254":"this is a thriller but not your average thriller the way it is written is very clever the main character is explaining what has gone before to his now fiancee and his tone is one of fatigue and almost apology i read it in 24 hours","255":" you move to a new place city country continent no one knows you or anything about you you can become anything or anyone you want to be you can leave behind the detritus of your old home city country life and start again you can live a life different from the one you left the more different the place the more different you can become nick platt is 30 something a lawyer who is now in his fourth year working and living in moscow he speaks russian fluently knows the city and feels he has a pretty good handle on the place in the early 2000s when the novel is set the former soviet republic is in the throes of embracing capitalism creating oligarchs and millionaires overnight nick works for a company that aids this process setting up and managing deals between western funds and eastern resources moving faster than the pace of change can keep up it is hardly surprising that moral and ethical lines are crossed and that the lines between good and bad legal and illegal moral and corrupt are blurred until they become indistinguishable how easy is it for someone born and brought up in a straight line place like britain with its centuries old justice system and christian ethic to be corrupted by a society where all the rules have recently been thrown away living on your wits and trying to outdo your opponents is really the only way to get ahead quite by chance one day or is it by chance nick meets two beautiful sisters an intense romance and love affair develops between nick and one of the girls masha in true capitalist fashion masha works for a mobile phone company in customer services and her sister is a student who also waits tables part time or are they they introduce nick to their elderly aunt tatiana who lives in a flat gifted to her by previous regimes she wants to leave moscow and retire to a new apartment block in the suburbs of moscow nick's services as a lawyer are enlisted to help the transactions go smoothly it becomes apparent fairly early on to the reader that something is not quite right in this set up and it is also apparent to nick that every step he takes in his relationships with these women takes him further off the true north of his moral compass but yet he seems incapable of getting himself back on track at the same time as this little scenario is unfolding the company he works for is involved in brokering a deal between a us bank and the cossack who is acting for an energy company looking at drilling oil off the coast and piping it overland alarm bells are ringing all over the place but again nick and his partner who is italian simply allow it all to happen it is almost as if they have now been in russia long enough to have had all the moral and ethical vestments of their previous lives fall off them this is most marked when about half way through the story nick goes back to england for christmas to see his parents his siblings and their families yes just like all good russian novels and movies they all seem to be set in the depths of winter and no one seems to be able to do winter quite like the russians the title 'snowdrop' refers to a corpse that has been covered by snow over winter and then as spring begins the thaw reveals the body at his parents' he just can't seem to find his feet or his heart for these few days now we all know family christmas can be a fraught business but his attitude is one of such non involvement that you can't help wonder if he really does have reason to hate his family getting back to moscow of course where he suddenly feels alive and at home you then know that he has probably been there too long if you were in the tropics it would be called 'gone troppo' in russia i don't know what they call it but all i can think is that the heart and soul have been iced over so of course as we become more certain the house of cards is going to fall over we watch with increasing fascination as nick clumsily negotiates his way around trying to deny what is going on but continuing to facilitate the process he narrates the story in hindsight some years later to a person we assume to be his fiancee either he is talking directly to her or writing a letter but however he is doing it his means of story telling is almost like a confession a complete unburdening of his soul almost as if he is seeking forgiveness this is dark foreboding writing nick has made a very small world for himself and in reading i almost felt a sense of suffocation as he finds himself sucked further and further into the vortex the writer lived in moscow for three years as correspondent for 'the economist' he writes beautifully of the city its physical structure and very atmospherically of its dark side its underbelly of which there is plenty none of the characters with the exception perhaps of tatiana and nick's elderly neighbour who represent the old russia are very nice people and i am glad i am not russian an unsettling story touching on the dark side of our inner selves and perhaps a morality tale on what can happen when you try to shed your old skin to take on a new one","256":"excellent job describing moscow after the fall of communism just found the main character's attitude toward his current girl friend annoying and at times cruel","257":"an edgy chilling tale of deception greed and corruption with a backdrop of snow covered dark mysterious evil moscow it will submerge you in the darkened world and have you looking over your shoulder my dreams were filled with twisted gangsters after reading this","258":"i must have missed something this book has had rave reviews and was nominated for the booker prize granted it was readable but that's about all i can say about it","259":"a thriller trying too hard to be thrilling decent enough but boring in the end not worth it","260":"a depressing take on modern russia","261":"read this sharp after the last hundred days basically the same premise dullish englishman gets entranced and conned in eastern europe but this one is infinitely better very atmospheric very well put together very menacing","262":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i found it very boring and predictable a man with no life is scammed by a couple of attractive russian women even when he knows he is being scammed he continues doing what they want in spite of the harm it brings to an innocent old lady even in his letter of admision to his fiancee he doesn't seem too upset about what he has done","263":"his is a

by the glitz and glitter of moscow itself as the two women act as his tour guide if you have ever seen the film the sting you will soon see the connection the author manages to provide an excellent picture of moscow in its post communist era where everyone is on the make and everyone is an actor recommended","264":"a very graphic description of post communist moscow","265":" this book was just okay for me the author did an excellent job with the setting his depiction of russia was wonderful and you got a real sense of the people culture and economy however his plot was lame it read like a long drawn out guilty confession the guy was writing the story to tell his current girlfriend fiance whatever about his time in russia and why he doesn't talk about it it still took him forever to get to the point spoiler alert all he had to do is say look i feel bad because i helped these two hot chicks scam an old lady out of her apartment and leave her homeless and possibly dead on the bright side russia is totally cool because that was the jist of his story lame i think that if the author had left the confessional aspect out of the book it would have been better if i asked somebody to tell me something and they wrote that much crap to get to the point i would be seriously irritated","266":"a sort of high noon where the sheriff is unable to make a moral choice and goes with the flow probably suffers from being nominated as a booker so reaches the reader loaded with expectations of fine writing very readable","267":"wonderful descriptions of moscow i could almost feel the cold so so story","268":"i really liked this book which was short listed for the man booker prize set in russia an englishman is the center of a quintessential russian scheme well done","269":" slick well written cautionary tale of decadent corrupt modern russia and a british expat out of his depth can he really be as gullible as he appears yes some people can be and besides the protagonist both likes it and wants it he's a bit of a well paid failure desperate to find some excitement before middle age fully claims him this short snappy book offers no great surprises and you could say its twists are telegraphed but then again its not a mystery or a thriller even though its packaged as one its a study of characters cultures the allure of dark places and the shameless immorality of the modern materialistic world it paints moscow as a city irredemably corrupt heartless and on the make nomatter what political colours it flies under worth reading if actually a bit depressing and not one for anyone about to take a holiday in moscow","270":"the plot was interesting but i didn't feel the characters were explored in much depth they're very 2d and the moral free fall that nick supposedly succumbs to and that i was so looking forward to reading doesn't seem wicked or corrupt enough rather he just comes across as naive and a bit gullible also for a lawyer he doesn't seem to take much notice of everyday legal tasks such as due diligence when dealing with masha and her acquaintances what saves this book for me is that as others have pointed out the most important character is moscow itself miller has an amazing eye for detail and noticing things that many of us would just pass by but unfortunately he doesn't seem to pay people and his characters as much attention","271":"an odyssey through the winter in russia the author describes the past in his life with a slight restraint because it is the part of his life he wishes to forget towards the end of the story like snowdrops he discovers that his real self has been dead and buried in the snow since he met the girls but does it deserve booker prize nomination it got i would have to say no","272":" possible spoilers ahead another of my pile of booker short list novels and the one so far that i have enjoyed least to be fair this isn't really anything to do with the quality of the writing but more to do with the timing and the subject matter i'm happy to believe that anything that made it to the short list is an example of good writing but in this case transporting me to a freezing grey moscow was not what i needed right now russia is a country with a remarkable history and a wonderful cultural legacy but everything i read about it these days paints a picture of an irredeemably corrupt and greedy society dominated by organised crime this would not in itself be a bad background to the tale but unfortunately the english protagonist also seems to have a rather dysfunctional moral compass or at least one that he can choose to ignore when it suits not being able to identify with any character has always been a problem for me since i clearly have problems with it perhaps i should explain the three stars which apparently equate to i liked it firstly the writer has spent enough time in moscow that he clearly has the authority to paint an accurate picture of the city and its way of life and it feels completely authentic secondly i find that the people live on in my mind quite vividly which is a tribute to the author's characterisation my final problem with it though was in the narrative voice the central conceit is that the work is in the nature of a confessional as the narrator seeks absolution for his dirty moscow past as he embarks on a new phase of his life three months before the big day clearly the recipient lady should run run fast and leave no forwarding address meanwhile our hero belongs back in the corpse filled grimy slush of the purgatory that is apparently modern moscow what i would have liked though is that our narrator didn't keep signalling what was coming in advance although it seems as though it was the author's deliberate choice perhaps to make this 1st person narrative more realistic by not artificially withholding the knowledge of how the plot unfolds even though the character was taken in fairly willingly himself thus we get forewarning that it is the last or next to last time we will meet a character etc all in all a fascinating and well drawn picture of moscow and modern russian life but not really what i wanted to be reading in a chilly grey february and definitely not calculated to have me ringing aeroflot to book my flight","273":"slow and inevitable like a russian winter and a tortured metaphor not unpleasant to read just predictable and forgettable","274":"i really enjoyed the setting for this book a snowy moscow winter in the early 2000s it works well with a dark plot and moody characters but i found the set up rather annoying - an englishman telling his fiance about his 'secret russian past' each time this thread was introduced it seemed jarring and implausible as were some of the actions of the main character having said that it's a very easy and quite enjoyable read with a good amount of intrigue and it's rather short too","275":"a passable story and interesting as an insight into modern day scams in russia however i'm surprised it made the booker shortlist","276":"i am finding this book quite boring nothing so far has grabbed my attention just a ot of familiar description discarding this book the time can be better spent reading something else","277":"snowdrops are russians who die on the streets in winter and bloom with the spring thaw the author has a love affair with the city of moscow with all of russia and his descriptions of that wild and wooly west during the go go days is wonderful the thin plot is only a excuse to write about life in russia and what is happening at all levels of society worth the two hours it took to read it","278":"miller was an economist correspondent between 2004 to 2007 he's covered everything pretty much that happened in russia during the noughties development of putinism gazprom the yukos business chechnya litvinenko's murder the orange revolutionk the tulip revolution what went down in belarus armenia georgia azerbaijan the lot so the novel despite its detractors has a ring of authenticity about it i couldn't put it down and it cloyed around my heart for a while afterwards","279":"very atmospheric i could almost feel the snow and cold of moscow in winter and i liked the characterisation however the end felt a bit of damp squib as i had expected a bigger denouement","280":"i mean it wasn't awful but i was just disappointed because it was a whole lot of build up to a whole lot of nothing sorry","281":"this is not everyone's cup of tea as it is a bit of a slow burn also the narrative in which the main protagonist tells the story in the form of a confession to his wife is a little odd and seems unnecessary however the characters and the setting are very interesting and you feel that you are watching a story unfold with an increasing sense of worry and dread very original and easy to read l","282":"chilling with its eerily familiar feel yet distant observations of the everyday detail of a russia opening up after its own political thaw carries well across cultures and perspectives with the romantic hope that innocence can still exist somewhere within us despite evidence to the contrary","283":"a brilliant and fascinating insight into the new russia","284":" i read this because it's on the 2011 man booker prize longlist the novel is the confession of a british lawyer's experience working in moscow who was scammed by two fetching young women as i read his narrative of his self deluded involvement in a serious criminal conspiracies i kept mentally shouting wake up you fool don't get sucked into these schemes this quotation from snowdrops sums up the book's cynical depiction of modern russia in russia there are no politics stories and there are no politics stories there are no love stories there are only crime stories snowdrops reminds me a bit of lecarre's recent novel our kind of traitor which i liked more because the characters and places are developed more completely in both novels the innocent victims are the characters who stay with me","285":"not bad but the characters are too one dimensional","286":"enjoyed this a lot was expecting it to be a standard crime drama but it surprised me i really felt part of the action and its also a great description of new russian society i really felt the uncertainty of the whole situation who is playing who","287":"a british lawyer nicholas platt is working in moscow in the hectic free for all wild east days of the new russia by day he helps negotiate huge bank loans to facilitate russia's economic development these deals involve a number of shady characters and questionable assumptions but nick is caught up in the free wheeling anything goes climate and whatever moral scruples he might have brought with him from the uk are quickly eroding the same is true of his personal life as nick gets caught up in exotic and often erotic lifestyle that flows from the rivers of cash that are flooding through the city one afternoon nick saves two attractive sisters from a purse snatcher and he is soon involved romantically with masha the older of the two the women are very mysterious even masha reveals little of herself to nick but he is too caught up in the intimacy which he believes to be love then masha and her sister katya ask nick to help their elderly aunt in the sale of her apartment and the purchase of a new one it quickly becomes apparent to nick that this deal may not be completely legitimate but by now he is completely bedazzled by masha and his moral compass has long since lost the ability to find true north he knows he is almost certainly heading for a fall but like any true noir character he's long past caring this is an excellent debut novel that paints a gripping portrait of the new russia and the seduction of man who is powerless to resist its allure it should appeal to those who like their novels dark and their characters flawed and in the grip of an attraction beyond their power to control","288":" certainly worth a read if it's anywhere near being accurate in the incidental details of life in post communist moscow it's scary if not it's a plausible creation of a parralel world worthy of tolkein or peake the book's written as a confession after all the events it describes to the protagonist narrator's future wife repugnant though some of it may be i think he captures something accurate about male conflict between self awareness with consequent self criticism and abnegation of responsibility through a version of gender determinism the descriptions of moscow it's climate it's people it's mores the transformations in it's architecture certainly seem well observed never been there but i believe him the various storylines there are at least three intertwine only through the main protagonist i was constantly fearing that they would turn out to be more interconnected in some dickensian super co incidence but they're not some echoes of gorky park for me some echoes of le carre's a most wanted man i want more books about post soviet russia to balance the picture this paints","289":"enjoyed book however story was very predictable enjoyed the description of russian life and will never look at a snowdrop in the same way again x","290":"the most heartbreaking last sentence in the history of recent fiction mysterious too i do wonder about the aim of the narrator do we need for him to be telling the story to someone other than us it feels gimmicky and not that interesting a device","291":"another booker prize entry from 2011 builds the tension up slowly from the start believable characters who slowly unravel revealing secrets as the book progresses the narrator comes across as neither a hero or villian of the piece and you can see how he is slowly captivated into the russian world my second favourite of the booker reads so far with pidgeon english out in front","292":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book had good recommendations i don't pass them on based in russia tries to focus on corruption and deceit but is just a little boaring","293":"this year our book club assigned me the sisters brothersfor our man booker prize session and i undertook to stray and read some of the other short listed books i plainly hated this one helpless self pitying whining poor rich white boy troubles i really hope the new fiancee of the main character will ditch him for her own sake i would assume there are interesting descriptions of moscow for those interested in city descriptions i'm not if i have to i buy a city guide","294":" russia is cured of communism a political wave that murdered millions of innocent civilians a d miller's snowdrops is a sharp psychological drama portraying the new russia that sprouts from the downfall of this dictatorship one that ripped the country from a monarchy and thrust it into invasive socialism yet the gigantic eastern power is by no means eradicated of the corruption that is ingrained into its very core driven by frenetic momentum this is the story of one lawyer's misfortune and the incapability to swerve from moral failings in a venal culture blinded by a young exotic \"romance\" and the state of his dull life nick platt unknowingly enters a world marked with barbaric slimy capitalism and rife with crime russia is a society without fear of consequence the conscience to judge itself or value morality miller's moscow is a world devoid of any chance for change lost in the waste of a dishonest and dismaying past escaping the relative blandness of england nicholas is the thirty something lawyer whose london employer posted him to moscow working on risky corporate finances deals that involve tremendous banking endeavours and matters associated with oil extraction he exists in a world governed by duplicity besides his pleasure and liberty in this foreign lifestyle nick is simply too naive too passive and incapable of thinking with the ruthless russian mindset to survive long term in such a sleazy and fraudulent community regardless of the warnings he receives from his best friend steve a journalist turned native and his neighbour oleg the main character neglects all advice in favour of a love affair and thus his unconscious crimes as he becomes entangled in a romance with masha and her seductive sister katya new life is breathed into nick's uneventful existence in russia and his infatuation begins to rule every decision however the dangerous repercussions of actions are not apparent until the psychological drama ends despite suggesting that these young women are possibly more than presumed he suppress such doubts and instead offers them free legal support in a property exchange which is questionable at best the narrator was himself was a dull sappy fellow whose arrogance towards the ease of his life causes fate to strike with an almighty blow the story which is essentially a long confessional letter to the reader and present fiancee neatly underlines the dangerous liberties of working as an expat in believing that he possessed everything russia had to offer nick becomes fearless of the consequences that make be inflicted upon his life and could disappear as rapidly as they arrived this narrative tone quietly reminds the reader that our confessions are what allow us to progress on from depravation and that moral jeopardy is the true stake we should all fear as human beings at times the story lost its way accounting every day occurrences rather than following with active scenes that consistently add value to the key theme or mystery of the novel miller's shortfalls were here in his storytelling that whilst well informed and cultured detracted from the central aspect of any crime thriller the crime itself despite revolving around fraud this is a thriller that lacks the punch of grisham patterson and wildly opposes the spectacles painted by the likes of stephen king this is the aspect that miller fails most regrettably in without a sense of heightened tension or venerating thrills the piece does not meet the conventions that readers expect nevertheless the novel is ignited by the provoking juxtaposing definitions of the term \"snowdrops\" firstly it is a bulbous plant a spring flower that blooms white and secondly the word is moscow slang for a corpse that lies hidden in the winter snow and emerges in the thaw this image alone chills the reader and is perhaps the symbolic powerhouse behind miller's publicity and man booker prize shortlisting throughout miller manufactures a satirical literary path for the reader forcing the audience to participate and be enticed by the very crimes that his writing ridicules as the entire story follows a retrospective outlook there is continual anticipation of the misfortune to come and no relief in the romance that nick inhabits an opposing path is laid for the readership an objective perspective which enables everything to be illuminated as it should do and not with the blinded naivety or arrogance for that matter of the main character hence we become personally aware of the \"snowdrop\" emblem and its representation of concealment even in the most pleasant of moments the piece is able to illustrate the innocence and deceit that humanity largely suffers from for nick it is the complicity that he will have to live with always the writing was poised terse and cohesive a true mark of miller's previous journalistic offerings in utilising his knowledge of russia the violence and capitalism undercurrent which seems to affect every element of the eastern culture the author creates a very raw vista of the country in the aftermath of communism it even takes the time to degrade the beliefs of those new russians those who believe they are immune to the corruption that the society suffered and thus superior in fact all that exists here all who live and work in russia are inexorably influence by such history without sounding judgemental the lowlife of moscow is still exactly as you would expect it cramped seedy and infected by opulence that only a few own however whilst it is a well observed novel it is disappointing in terms of energy the star of snowdrops is the russian grandeur itself the restaurants and black alleys swanky nightclubs and snow filled streets the freezing weather and the overwhelming corruption indeed descriptions are occasionally striking \"the ice on the river was buckling and cracking great plates of it rubbing and jostling each other as the water shrugged it off a vast snake sloughing off its skin \" rather than demonstrating shattering emotional experience snowdrops offers subtle moral significance \"that's what i learned when my last russian winter thawed the lesson wasn't about russia it never is i don't think when a relationship ends it isn't your lover that you learn about you learn about yourself \" snowdrops is a moral deconstruction of modern politics exhibiting the replacement of compassion with barbarous sly crimes that people commit with no inclination of remorse or regret informative and mildly provoking miller's debut novel makes no effort to rapidly jolt its audience along but focuses on the moral reality of this superpower and the \"city of neon lust and frenetic sin \" in undermining the expectation of its audience the element of crime chiefly removed from the tale the author disappointingly opts for moral thrills instead nevertheless the honesty of miller's conclusions demonstrate the unsettling disconnection faced by humanity the ability for people to somehow separate and bury their actions their flaws and crimes as if they never existed it is a warning of the dangers of staring at something for too long forgetting to truly notice what you are seeing russia or perhaps more suitably life is not commanded by the bleak continuity of the snow but what is masked underneath that chill","295":"the ending still haunts me loved this book","296":"this novel conjures up images of a corrupt seedy dangerous and atmospheric modern day moscow you can feel practically feel the cold of winter and understand why nick gets completely taken in by his new found friends masha and katya i thought oleg 's russian proverb was particularly poignant 'the only place with free cheese is a mousetrap' nick should have known better an entertaining read","297":"very good portrayal of a westerner adrift in the madness of post communist russia","298":" eh i read this novel on the recommendations of two friends who don't know each other nor do they have anything to do with each other independent recs i simply don't see what they were on about the writing was pretty mediocre at best and the character was completely unlikable not that the character has to be sympathetic bur it's the matter of course the assumption in which he presents his story like 'of course these are the ways of the world for everyone and of course what i did was ok and whatever anyone else would have done ' there is no self awareness not real self depreciation no real apology for any of his bad deeds or attitudes i mean he thinks that way so naturally everyone else does right lame the story could have been better but wan't terrible one thing that completely dragged it down was this arbitrary and pointless confession device to an unnamed recipient of his letters how can't respond to any of his matter of fact misogyny ugh who cares about that person the framing could have totally used some work read a james bond novel instead","299":" 2011 man booker prize short list goal for 2012 p 81 in russia there are no business stories and there are not politics stories there are no love stories there are only crime stories even though i only gave this book 3 stars it's really much closer to a 4 for me i wish goodreads had an option to give 3 and 1 2 stars i would give this one about 3 9 not quite a 4 for me but almost what i liked about this book is that it has a great sense of place i have never been all that interested in russia or moscow but this book does a great job of painting it as an alluring place of new money and new opportunity even as that money and those opportunities are corrupt this story is about russia and moscow specifically as much as it is about anything one quote i loved p 147 russia is like lariam you know that malaria medicine that can make you have wild dreams and jump out of the window you shouldn't do it if you're the kind of person who gets anxious or guilty nick you shouldn't do russia this psychological drama is much better than before i go to sleep i can feel the coming train wreck but like the main character nick i'm just barreling along through the frozen moscow winter with my eyes wide open and enjoying the ride the novel is written in semi epistolary form as a confession letter to nick's soon to be wife about his time in moscow that point of view was helpful as it allowed for nick's conversational and explanatory tone it also makes for a questionably reliable narrator he's apparently baring his soul and he does reveal many unflattering details about himself but because he's telling his own story somewhat apologetically to be sure he's also working hard to justify his actions or rather his inaction this is a very booker like book in that it's really one man's story about himself that character journey is so typical of the booker books it's well written with great descriptions and characterizations which don't bog down the narrative most everything that happens is foreshadowed throughout the book which if you're a more sophisticated reader of mysteries and thrillers would probably mean you figure out the ending quite early in the novel but this is not a mystery this is the crime fiction referenced above snowdrops is a psychological thriller and what pulls you to the end is not trying to figure out what happened or whodunnit but rather why what happened happened in the end i learned something about myself in the grading of this novel i didn't think i was the kind of reader that needed some kind of redeemable character in order to like a book but apparently i am there's no real humanity to latch onto with nick and in the end that kept me at arm's length if i could have felt any kind of sympathy or understanding for him i think this would have been a 4 but nick didn't touch me in any way although i enjoyed his story and i especially enjoyed modern moscow","300":"part of me thinks i didn't give this book the attention it deserved then again i wonder if there was something about this book that meant it just wasn't enough to hold my attention i think it relates to the fact that the reader knows from the beginning how the story's going to end the actual details may be a mystery but we read the story with the same sense of impending doom that the central character nick platt holds throughout the book or at least that's how i read it and knowing that watching nick's slow inexorable march towards the point of no return well this is a book without hope and where all the principal characters are beyond redemption that's just really really bleak","301":" funny relatable easy read snowdrop's expatriate story perfectly captures the mix of confusion and freedom one feels when in another country - and the nostalgic regrets after leaving i found miller's decsription of moscow and it's picaresque characters familiar i spent one season in moscow from the april thaw moscow's jungly green explosion of the summer to the lingering warmth of babe leto grandmother's summer russia's version of indian summer this story takes place from the end of one summer to the beginning of the next it's a heartfelt fateful addictive journey that foreshadows itself all along the way a slow trainwreck that for some reason leaves you longing to experience it all over again the story becomes intimate with its unsavory and colorfully guileful characters it's a love story for the misled and the dishonest alike","302":"umm a teeny bit disappointing have been obsessed with soviet and post soviet russia for a while now the metaphor and the blurb on the back cover had completely blown me away hence the excitement when i finally did get to buy it at half price too of which i'm glad snowdrops corpses that float up when the snow thaws such a beautiful allegory however so much more could've been done with it i really wanted to love this book but couldn't and i do not see why it was longlisted for the booker that said it has enough to warrant one read it seems to go nowhere initially but the last two chapters nail it","303":"an unusual story which takes place in russia after the dissolution of the soviet union straighforward good writing makes the story of a british lawyer whose self awareness comes after he becomes the victim of his own naivete and the prevalence in that milieu of extreme corruption compelling reading","304":" i first heard about this novel on the review show on bbc2 and was intrigued enough by the discussion to break my resolution about not buying any more books until a they were available for sony ereader and b i was ready to read them but right from the exquisite jacket design i was so gripped with this book that i decided a physical copy was in order i picked up sunday evening and would have happily read it in one sitting if only life hadn't been so tortuously in the way as first time novels go this is an enormous achievement the prose is dazzling and moscow is evoked in a way that makes this the gorky park of the new millennium the plot is entirely linear and is essentially the inevitable forward motion of one man's failure to swerve any of the moral hazards he encounters while working as an expat lawyer in russia the narrator is very clear about what a flawed and cowardly creature he is and yet it is a joy to read on because of the insights he offers into russian culture and society as someone who has lived and worked as an expat in two european countries i felt this book really nailed that heady sense of possibility that comes with the early stages of living abroad the feeling that you can be who you want to be run risks you never would normally take because you've stepped out of time for a bit to me this was neatly underlined by the notion that the text was effectively a long confessional letter from the narrator to his fiancee during discussion on the review show there were those who felt this narrative conceit didn't quite work but personally i found it added real resonance to the novel by quietly reminding us now and then that the narrator did actually want his wife to be to have a good opinion of him and to accept him depraved past and all we were reminded that the real stakes here are moral jeopardy depravity is only interesting if those engaging in it have their doubts and so find their own behaviour wanting all in all this a novel to thoroughly enjoy and admire and i would have given this five stars if not for two things which began to grate by the end firstly i'd have been happier if the two parallel strands of the plot had amplified each other more in some way rather than simply being two different examples of the same character's moral indifference secondly i found the prose relied a bit too heavily on unwarranted foreshadowing which then tended not to deliver as big a bang as promised somehow but overall there is no shortage of things for the reader to be gripped by and to admire i only hope a d miller is out there somewhere right now putting the finishing touches on his next novel","305":"bleak but gripping a fascinating insight into post communist ussr would make a great film","306":"this was beautifully written one of those books about which i think to myself i would like to be able to write descriptive prose like that russia in the winter came alive to me as i read it i could feel the cold and although the storyline is such that you know from quite early on what will happen it really doesn't matter because that is in a way the whole point of the book a reflection on why we make the choices we do even when we know they are the wrong ones","307":"a begrudging 2 stars because i did on parts like the portrait of russia but frankly i was very underwhelmed by the plot dull and predictable and the characters were thin even the protagonist","308":"a bit of a slow start took me a while to get into the story most interesting were the author's main characters observations about modern russian society i just hope it's actually not as depraved in reality as was portrayed in this novel not even one admirable character in the book","309":"there seems to be quite a lot of negative reviews floating around the book partly i think due to some giving unfair scores because they deem the novel to be unworthy of the booker prize nomination that probably led many to read it for me the complaints should be with the booker judges and not the novel itself i personally thought it was a throughly enjoyable read and although maybe not quite deserving of its nomination its hardly fair to use this as a stick to beat it with i also think that reading some of the reviews and quotes attached to the front of the novel i'm not sure if i have read the same book as those reviewers words like electrifying stunned and dazzling are used in a way that i cant quite understand it seems to be marketed as a fast paced thriller whereas in fact there isn't much suspense or excitement in the story at all indeed from very early on in the narrative its quite clear how the plot is roughly going to play out but i actually enjoyed that there was something horrible yet compelling about knowing the direction things will go my girlfriend read this before me and liked it but remarked that if it had been set anywhere else other than russia she would not have enjoyed it all i think this is a very apt description as although the plot doesn't offer much suspense the portrait miller paints of russia is fascinating and goes a long way i think to explaining the books success i tend to read a lot of thrillers but i liked the pacing of this and the fact the everything isn't tied up in a nice neat package in the end the protagonist stays throughly unlikable and is never exhonerated for his sins and some things are left a mystery it felt like a real story and although the way it is told by the protagonist relaying this tale to his fiancee feels a little cheap it very rarely affected my reading of the novel overall a very interesting look at russia and a well written story","310":"a really good read well paced and the plot slowly unfolds created a desire within me to visit moscow romance with a mystery","311":"interesting storyline but it was easy to see what was going to happen ultimately","312":"capturing the post kremlin era it helps that it's through the eyes of an expat british lawyer well captures the various layers of the times where anything can be bought at a price","313":" browsing through a few reviews here suggests that snowdrops has really divided opinion with most readers either loving or hating it resulting in a fairly mediocre overall rating most if not all of the novels i've read set partly or wholly in russia are ones that i've enjoyed and no doubt this contributed to me picking up snowdrops despite not being a lengthy novel snowdrops is never in a rush and miller has time to pass on fascinating nuggets of moscow life and casual observations that never get tiresome it's made clear fairly early on that something goes wrong before we turn the final page although it isn't until the story unfolds that the reader begins to guess what it might be i'm not sure why miller chose to have his protaganist tell the story in retrospect to i assume his wife partner but it made no difference to me or the story miller has a straightforward writing style that is clever with words without ever having the need of a dictionary i enjoyed his prose and it served the dual purpose of telling the story and creating an atmosphere at the same time perfectly it's difficult to pigeonhole snowdrops as it doesn't fit firmly into any genre there's culture crime and romance but at its heart snowdrops is a bit of a paradox dark but full of charm it consists of several strands which are all rather vague i can understand why some readers did not get along with snowdrops but i loved the way miller told his tale and was disappointed to discover that it's his only novel","314":"i've read very mixed reviews about this book but i thought it was excellent it's portrayal of moscow is fascinating and i like the use of the snowdrop metaphor people complain that the characters are two dimensional but isn't that because he doesn't really know any of them on a deeper level i wouldn't marry him after reading this though","315":" snowdrops set is moscow during the last decade is ostensibly a crime love story nick platt a british corporate lawyer bored with his life in london moves to russia to start over he gets involved in two real estate deals one for a client building an oil tanker port and the other to help out a young woman he meets in the metro nick tells the story to a new girl friend back in london with hints of his naivete and denial along the way the first person narrative style creates a distance from everyone but the main character who by his own admission is a little dull i just couldn't get into the story what the book is really about is the crime and corruption that dominates everyday life in russia and this intrigued me the author who is the economist correspondent in moscow has a love hate relationship with the city which is both traditional and exotic but at the same time is run by a cut throat oligarchy whose values permeate all levels i visited russia twelve years ago and his description of a culture where human life isn't valued and basic survival is always an issue really resonated with me miller is a good writer and this is a 2011 booker prize nominee this is not a great mystery but i do recommend it to anyone who is interested in russia culture","316":" having seen this was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 and seeing the good reviews i cast aside my other brilliant kindle books and started this instead it certainly started off well but half way through i figured out what was probably going to happen but steadfastly stuck with it in the hope it would gather speed i was bitterly disappointed when nothing really happened and the end just fizzled out in my opinion goodness knows why this has been shortlisted as i am at a complete loss as to the point of it all tatiana was the only character i liked at all the others were all loathsome i am now going back to my c j sansom book which i know will be superb sorry a d miller but i doubt i will be reading any more of your books if they are like this","317":"wow this was a very enjoyable book modern day russia is a bit of a mystery to me and this book either confirms or simply re enforces the stereotypes of a wild west type atmosphere the story asks all sorts of interesting ethical and moral questions but does little to answer them for you","318":"provides fascinating insight into moscow corruption and life moving character is tatiana she probably knows about the scam nick is a pretty frustrating character even his uk love is not true not sure i liked the book","319":"i loved the way the author wrote about moscow really captured the feeling of life in this amazing city it became one of the best best characters the story flowed well and was gripping enough to keep me reading it depicted the lives of people living in this city very well the seediness the hopelessness and the difficulty of expats trying to fit in if you have been to moscow you will enjoy reading about the famous and not so famous landmarks in the city","320":" i don't usually take the time to write reviews but this book frustrated me so much that i have to vent the entire premise of the book drove me mad the idea that the whole book is a confession to his fiancee and the unfortunate tone he takes with her maybe that's a sign that the technique was successful that i was disgusted with him but i don't buy it the writing quality was reasonable although there were some repetitive similes around the place mainly focusing on war and battle a handful of such references would have been enough rather than really labouring the effect i'm a pedant but hey there was also a lot of anticipation as to the bad things he was going to confess however in the end the conclusion was more subtle not as explosive as i'd been expecting perhaps the author provides a useful perspective like this is the kind of stuff that ordinary banal corrupted people can get up to rather than the exceptionally heinous things that war criminals and gangsters would do as i was nearing the end of the book i couldn't wait to get through it to power through not because it was amazing but because i wanted to get it out of my life it was that difficult to appreciate that frustrating like some other people who have reviewed this i just don't understand the glowing reviews the book has received and the idea that it was short listed for the man booker prize the book did provide some insights into the nature of contemporary russia however these were largely trite and token observations the overall premise structure storyline of the book was woefully inadequate okay rant over","321":"a mystery scam set in moscow loved the atmosphere miller makes you feel like you are there with his descriptions you can figure out what will happen about 2 3 of the way through yet you are compelled to keep reading","322":"a very interesting and informative read about early capitalism in moscow","323":"very atmospheric","324":" moscow or russia period doesn't feel like its a pleasant or safe place and certainlythat's how it pans out for nicholas or kolya befriended on the metro by the lovely mashaand her sister katya he's led on a merry dance as they tap into his lawyering skills andlack of russian smarts snowdrops is well written and with a comfortable wry sense of humour a snowdrop by the way isn't just an early flowering plant its also russian slang for a murdered body that's hidden in the snow and only discovered in the thaw after another longand brutal winter","325":"powerful psychological drama of modern day moscow with it's corruption and crime and how much one man will let himself be ensnared by that immoral world with only partly shut eyes and in the name of 'love' come on a 38 year old sleazy lawyer being with 2 beautiful cold and bland girls really and at what price read the whole thing this shabbat afternoon and was pretty engrossed not giving him 5 stars because although setting is described vividly sometimes felt like he was trying too hard the format as a letter to a girlfriend about the protagonist's past misdeeds is cursory and doesn't ring true and he belabours the same point too much near the end a first novel and the author has been a russian correspondant for a few years for the economist and it is clear he knows the country and culture shortlisted for the man booker and cwa gold dagger prizes 2011","326":"i liked the descriptions of moscow really put me there made me want to go there it was harrowing nice insight into the russian psyche","327":"style is awful except for couple of sentences but it was fun","328":"gripping and full of twists a fun and easy to get along with read","329":" 3 and a half stars really but there were some problems with the characterisation the narrator's voice was very british but still much too much a generic character rather than anyone british who we could meet i felt that the experience was meant to show us how diminished he was by the experience and how boring his fiancee must be to be attracted enough to wish to marry him the other characters because decsribed by the narrator were second hand and not well defined the main subject was moscow and russia itself which was made real and fascinating to me the depth of opportunism portrayed was eye opening but not surprising and by the end i felt that there was nothing that stood between kindness and greed there difficult to take on board for the 21st century","330":"i considered giving this a 3 star rating because it had a couple of redeeming features but overall the writing was awkward and it was all a big fat cliche but to be fair i rather like russian cliches kudos for the description of a wannabe oligarch who looked like a perplexed potato","331":"quite depressing and not that interesting surprised it was on the list for man booker prize finalists","332":"a d miller's novel of contemporary russia portrays corruption at every level framed as narrator nick platt's written confession to his english fiancee the story is about what happened in his last winter in moscow where he had spent three years for his law firm the title refers to corpses that are buried or left in the snow over the long russian winter only to emerge as rotting evidence during the spring thaw making it difficult to ascertain the causes of death or to pursue any malefactors a friend of nick's russian neighbor is one such snowdrop but it is a metaphor for other types of corruption that take place over this final winter the novel was shortlisted for the man booker prize and is beautifully written with a lucid economy of language that keeps the narrative moving but makes every page a quiet delight take this description of the cossack a shady russian businessman that nick's firm is helping with project finance we passed the document to the cossack he turned the first page turned it back again pushed the file away sat back in his chair and puffed out his cheeks he looked around as if he was waiting for something else to happen a strip show maybe or a stabbing the blue and gold onion domes of the novospassky monastery winked at us through the ninth floor window from across the moscow river then he started making jokes the cossack had one of those senses of humour that are really a kind of warfare laughing at his jokes made you feel guilty not laughing at them made you feel endangered his personal inquiries always felt like the prelude to blackmail the main narrative revolves around nick's encounter with masha as he helps her and her sister katya chase off a purse snatcher in the metro a bachelor intoxicated in a timid english way with the licentiousness of post soviet moscow nick is intrigued by the willowy masha and her growelly voice masha and katya have come from murmansk to seek their fortunes in moscow nick fears he may not be as rich or powerful as masha was hoping for but that there might be hope for him anyway somewhat to his surprise a relationship develops he goes clubbing with the two girls masha ends up in his bed his dreams come true and they become lovers he accompanies the two girls to a magical stay in a dacha and a sensual episode in the banya they introduce him to their aunt a babuschka who ended up with a large apartment in central moscow through the privatisation that followed the fall of the soviet union the aunt wants to trade his now valuable apartment for a smaller flat on the fringes of moscow where she has a view of the countryside the two girls have found a deal for her where she gets the new apartment and $50 000 in exchange for her old apartment and ask nick to help draw up the paperwork the reader knows from nick's statements foreshadowing the end that this does not turn out well nick comes to suspect that the apartment trade like the cossack's oil project in the arctic may not be totally on the level and yet in both cases he is willing to play along the cossack's deal is no more shady than most of the transactions his law firm handles they have all the documents properly stamped and a surveyor has certified the suitability of the site and progress of the work there on the apartment deal nick is able to gather all the appropriate papers for the aunt's side of the transaction as nick readily confesses to his prospective wife he felt much bigger in russia than in england he cuts short a sad trip home for christmas where he is once again dismayed at the blandness of his parents' existence in russia there was danger there was excitement there was an electricity in the air that made the challenges of the cold the ubiquitous bribery and the borderline sense of lawlessness all worthwhile he knows that things are not what they seem but the lure of masha's charms on the one hand and the chance to score a big one for the firm on the other hand keep him going in the wrong direction eyes wide open miller's portrayal of wild and woolly moscow rings true from everything one reads about the post soviet gangsterism nick cannot escape its corrupting influence but not because he is soft and innocent rather miller's point seems to be because we all are as corrupt as the russians at heart even though we have put a thin veneer of civilization over the raw brutality that reigns in moscow miller maintains the atmosphere of quiet intensity throughout the narrative there is suspense even though the reader has a good idea of how things are going to end every once in a while there is a false note a metaphor that is too stretched a turn of phrase that is too cute but it is a debut novel the reader remains sympathetic to nick while facing the full extent of his corruption but his fiancee would be crazy to marry him after reading this confession it is one senses by the end of the book his way of punishing himself","333":"goodreads crashed when i wrote my review alas but this novel lacks style pacing and cleverness the novel is four or five steps behind the reader when it should be the other way around and the mentioning of the concept of a snowdrop although used as an epigraph happens 50 pages from the end and then is used at the climax 10 pages later there are many freshman mistakes here especially the conceit of the book this story could have been told over a drink in a bar 50 pages or so and to extend it to a 'full length novel' of 260 required a lot of padding and dull sequences that further make the reader feel above the narrative the characters are flat and one sided outside of why the narrator is writing this story to his future wife we never get any further questions no further ruminations just the fact ma'am the story isn't fast paced and interesting enough to be a thriller nor is it thoughtful and ponderous enough to be a literary work it sits unhappily between them and is unsuccessful as either however the jacket cover is gorgeous it's a shame the interior work isn't nearly up to that level","334":"i enjoyed this glimpse into post communist russia it left me with such a sad feeling being russian and a first generation american it feels so sad that the country went from oppression to having no idea what to do with it all once it was lifted i know this is fictionalized and really just a glimpse into this new world but my suspicion is that it is pretty right on","335":" this novel is set in moscow a city i would like to visit were it not for vague oppressive thoughts about what might happen to a traveller there reading snowdrops has done little to improve my pessimism it is set either towards the end of president putin's first presidency or during his second he isn't mentioned by name but references to a 'weasel' president may identify him in some minds in it nick working in a branch of his london firm of solicitors encounters the mysterious masha and her chum katya there follows a series of personal and professional intrigues that paint a convincing mural of both small and large corruption and criminality the writing is clear and evocative but from early on i had problems with nick's wisecracking and hard boiled words and aphorisms he is our narrator and the picture he paints of himself is all together milder and more sensitive than his streetwise jargon suggests he is also prone to investing the closing words of some characters with phrases like 'god is in his heaven and the tsar is far away ' a few of these are pretty good but there were eventually too many for me i would often have preferred normal narrative i like the central device whereby the novel is set in the form of a lengthy letter to a loved one in london who we never meet it is also a confession coupled with an interesting insight into how emotion and environment can impact and sometimes propel people to do things they would never normally consider that is the real story here and moscow as depicted is a convincing fulcrum for making it happen","336":" mostly i enjoyed this book it was a real page turner because of the way miller deftly plants the seeds of general foreboding and i just wanted to figure out what happened to our man in moscow that said i found the narrative conceit that the narrator is writing some sort of 'coming clean' story for his fiancee to be a bit of a cheap trick that didn't support the way the narrative is actually written who would write a confessional with so many clear hooks to keep the reader guessing right up to the end","337":"i really enjoyed this book set in a recent snow bound russian winter a 'literary thriller' where an english through an act of kindness and trying to do the good thing finds himself caught up in legally questionable activities the author is a russian correspondent for the economist","338":"spoiler alert naive british attorney gets duped by glamorous women in moscow the only thing more stupid that he does is tell his fiance all about it just the same the audio book is well read","339":"failed to live up to the hype no tension no psychological insight useless plot device author showing off that he lived in russia did not add authenticity hmm booker judges must have been able to find another book to make the shortlist this year at least they didn't let it win","340":"thought provoking book about modern day russia","341":" this book is a story told by nicholas to his fiancee it is the story of his time spent as a british lawyer living in russia there he is befriended by two girls who may not be all they appear i don't want to give too much away but this is a thriller where you basically know the ending even so i still found the book suspenseful and only finished it in a couple of days the author depicts russia as a very corrupt place where i almost felt like no one had a conscious i know that cannot be true and it was only the only real complaint i have against this book i was surprised to see how many people didn't like this book because i found it really enjoyable","342":"not a riveting psychological drama at all i can't resist saying that there was some screwing but it was hardly riveting i didn't become attached to any of the characters it was interesting mostly as a portrait of a tawdry alien world","343":"horrible book i finished it only because it was the book discussion book for january i kept hoping that it would get better but no bad the whole way through just glad i do not live in russia","344":"the author obviously knows moscow well i liked the style of writing it felt comfortable and familiar the story is of a british lawyer u0026amp his time in moscow the girl he meets the things he gets up to the things he sees and tries to forget i did enjoy it in a slow paced not much happens kind of way 3 5 stars","345":" the eponymous snowdrop refers to a body buried under the winter snow which only comes to light in the thaw the image is relevant both literally and metaphorically to ad miller's moscow tale of corruption and moral erosion the book is ostensibly a letter from nick to his fiancee cleaning the slate by confessing his past during the early years of the millennium he's working as a lawyer in moscow where he meets masha and katya and so begins his decay it's difficult to talk about the book without giving too much away but it makes you think the author uses the setting of wintry moscow and the period just before the credit crunch to great reflective effect nick's moral choices are underpinned by a sense of 'right here right now this is just how it works' but one day the snow will melt you'll enjoy this if you like gorky park martin cruz smith closer notes on a scandal patrick marber icon frederick forsyth","346":"it is only by accident that i read anything off the man booker awards winner or short list because they go for literature with a capital l difficult complex books and this book is not the taut suspense that some reviews promised instead like a graeme green novel it's the tale of a man who lost himself in the expat experience who sees what's happening sees his moral compass being bent but looks away because he's in too deep the honey trap hook has been set in particular the dialog is excellent he captures the rhythm of russians speaking english he creates an atmosphere of predatory new russia that feels true","347":"i kept waiting and waiting for the plot to become more twisting and turning and preferably more exciting than it actually did it paints a vivid picture of greed and corruption in russia coupled with the chilling moscow winter the book makes it clear from the start that the outcome is not going to be a happy one but for me there were simply not enough avenues to the plot to make this book an absolute pageturner","348":" i think i am more intrigued by other readers' response to this book than i was by the book itself it was highly recommended by several friends and was a contender for the booker prize so i eagerly moved it to the top of the to be read pile as i compile my mental list of wonderful books this would never make my short list but i do commend the author for forcing me to think about what makes a book readable what makes a book memorable and what makes a book wonderful miller's first person narrative initiallly made the book readable for me it pulled me into the story because it felt very personal very reflective and eventually confessional that stylistic device also creates a story that is narrowly focused on one person's point of view and as the story unfolded it so limited the reader's perspective that i would have liked a parallel narrative from another character's point of view the story was complete but only included what the narrator elected to relay to his correspondant that wasn't enough for me the panoramic picture of contemporary russia was impressively painted by the author i felt like i was watching a film not reading a novel hmmmmmm perhaps this was written with that in mind in the very best sense it was an exposure to moscow that paralleled reading raymond chandler's novels set in los angeles miller provided me a memorable interlude in moscow and i was very anxious to book the first available flight home what makes a book wonderful is very personal for me it is usually characters i want to live with or escape from and episodes in the book that illuminate some facet of human nature i didn't find that in this book i would love to read the notes from the deliberations of the booker committee to understand why snowdrops was in contention for the prize","349":"a d miller's noir thriller is nearly impossible to put down once started moscow that city of neon lust and frenetic sin is skillfully painted in all its contradictions and juxtapositions it is a strange country russia with its talented sinners and occasional saint bona fide saints that only a place of such accomplished cruelty could produce a crazy mix of filth and glory nothing is as it seems in this book and ethics are continually stretched to the limit the book is written in the format of attorney nick platt's recollection of his time in moscow as he shares it with his fiancee now residing in london where he is from originally he recalls the few years he spent as a lawyer in moscow and how they affected his life can his fiancee still accept him and will she still want to marry him once she hears what happened during his time in moscow will she be able to understand his part in the events that unfolded and forgive him is he able to forgive himself or is that even important nick is in moscow during russia's high flying times where makers and shakers easily spend two hundred dollars on a massage where everyone has a scam and you're part of it in some way where banks loan millions of dollars to companies on a wish and a dream it's a strange time in a strange country the russians will do the impossible thing the thing you think they can't do the thing you haven't thought of they will set fire to moscow when the french are coming or poison each other in foreign cities they will do it and afterwards they will behave as if nothing has happened at all and if you stay in russia long enough so will you this is nick's predicament he is caught up in several complex and laborious scams and he searches within himself to see when he first turned the other way or did he not see anything coming and get run over by a mack truck the novel begins with nick rescuing two sisters on the metro masha and katya they are young long legged beauties nick is close to forty feeling his age and seeing his middle expand masha is 24 and katya is 20 just old enough for nick to enjoy without feeling any guilt he is especially fond of masha and together they hit the night life of moscow and begin a passionate affair at least it is passionate for nick at times masha appears to be play acting and going through the motions but that's okay with nick who daydreams about a life with her one day out of the blue masha and katya ask nick to help with the legal work entailed in finding their aunt tatiana a new apartment nick agrees and continues with the process even when he finds out that he has been fed a lot of lies nick is also involved in the legal aspects of attaining a huge loan for an oil rigging company in order for the loan to go through the company must have its construction completed on time a certain amount of capital needs to be generated in the future and of course there is that unending stack of russian paperwork and workers that need to be bribed there's a little problem when the surveyor for the project disappears for a few days and then comes back with a report that everything is clean as a whistle then he disappears again who can say that this means anything at all who can say that it doesn't nick finds himself in a conundrum everywhere he turns he tries on different realities for size and stretches his ethics like a rubber band he enters a world where the lure of sin is almost impossible to resist in russia do as the russians do but he is not russian and there is a little voice in his head that tells him `maybe i should look at this a little differently' this is the best kind of literary thriller and page turner one that is intelligent complex and rewarding there is no deus ex machina at the end and all the pieces work marvelously as they bring the reader to a thrilling conclusion one that is heart stopping and heart breaking","350":"i kept waiting for this book to 'happen' i'm still not sure if i liked it or not i didn't dislike it but there just felt like there was something missing however there were some subtle splashes of brilliance which maybe help me see why it is a booker prize contender i'm still not sure it should be a contender though after reading it the way the author portrayed russia fit in with many of my images of it and stereotypes cold corrupt and soul less however that said i felt this strong urge to visit in summertime after reading it there's something intriguing about this country despite the dark underside portrayed in this book it has a unique 'soul' that may be characterised by dubious characters and a frivolous way of living this is just the impression i got from the book and i am very aware this does not necessarily reflect reality i did not warm to masha at all and knew she was playing nick right from the start due to nick the narrator alluding to this the beauty was that while i knew there was something not right i was never sure what even when it was alluded to more strongly the further into the book i got while the reveal was not a complete surprise it was not exactly what i expected with so many sinister characters and divergent plots i anticipated them being tied up differently the book is a good lesson in perception of what is right and wrong and the subtleties of being brought into a way of life that perhaps you didn't think you wanted or saw yourself being a part of the theme of morality is ever present and perhaps it is the grey areas throughout that didn't sit as easily with me not that i was judging it just felt odd that there was a skewed view of events but that is the beauty of the narrative device here and i actually think the narrative we hear in this book is more 'real' than some other books i have read","351":" the protagonist of snowdrops is probably the most gullible man in the world the fact that he is a lawyer seems incredulous right from the beginning of the book i wanted to scream at him whenever he did something stupid and the strangest bit is that he actually seems to know at some primordial level that he is getting himself into a tangle it does make the novel quite hard to swallow as a realistic piece of fiction what is real are the descriptions of moscow and russia in general the author was a correspondent of the economist in russia for a long time and the prose clearly shows his familiarity with the place though it doesn't really explain his cynicism with the country which is quite evident too the book is solidly written with some passages of quietly wry humor but it is let down by a weak plot which never reaches the heights that you are led to believe it would reach in the beginning this book could have been so much more","352":"a good quick read an interesting and somewhat suspenseful portrayal of decadent russia post soviet the narrator relates his involvement with two beautiful russian women and their real estate scheme the plot kept the pages turning","353":"this was a much heralded book and i am wondering why shortlisted for the booker i am mystified it was distinctly average one of those books where you are waiting for something to happen and it never does disappointed","354":"i will never look at a snowdrop in the same way again an interesting book that captures the atmosphere really well a little disappointed at the ending but overall i enjoyed it","355":" i got to page 88 and finally gave up i started the book thinking hey it's about hedonism the allure of sin what's not to like apparently everything it has a good plot but the storyline was very slow sometimes the author printed the russian and english dialogue other times just english stick with one way please i'll give the guy one thing there was a great description of a particular thug the cossack he was described as equal parts twinkle and menace pg 24 that was fantastic but otherwise i just can't recommend this book maybe the next one","356":"thriller mystery set in the early part of the 21st century corporate lawyer finds himself befriend my a young attractive russian we see the strange wild wild east country that has came out of the crumbling ruins of the old soviet empire sharp terse prose with a chanderlesque turns of phrase in parallel is the narrator's work story and its eventually outcome a simple and easy read i managed to read this in a few days just found out that a d miller worked for the economist magazine so it background would appear more fact than fiction","357":"echo's of chekhov the russian winter mirrors the cold callous protagonists","358":"blech terrible people including the narrator doing terrible things it was incredibly difficult to enjoy this book when it's narrator was such a simpering loser who lacked all insight into personal responsibility the framing of the novel made him even more distasteful","359":"i am most disappointed in this book it's slow repetitive and the story line is dull apart from the description of the city and weather this did not grip me at all in fact it gave me brain freeze","360":"i miss moscowlast line from snowdrops whoever decided snowdrops should be on the booker prize shortlist must have nakhuiachit'sia to liven it up because this was utterly dull the boring characters and tedious plot made just didn't engage me whatsoever here am i thinking it was only the booker winners that could be bad","361":" this is my first book about russia post ussr meltdown a d miller is a british expat being the economist magazine correspondent assigned to work for 3 years in russia in the early 2000's his storytelling is straightforward his sentences are short but full of sense and this story is believable his use of russia as a backdrop with its snow is just bewildering that reminded me of those white everywhere scenes in boris pasternak's doctor zhivago i have read a good chunk of booker winning and shortlisted works but this is my first time to encounter a suspense thriller novel similar to the works of john le carre guy lit with a heart without being melodramatic and john le burke for the use of the setting to heighten the mood of the novel the story revolves around nick who is writing a letter to his new fiancee about his stay in russia as company lawyer russia is a corrupt country and their white snow seems to be in full contrast with the rotten government officials and shrewd businessmen the poor russians are the ones who are suffering as they lose their property resort to prostitution or commit crimes a snowdrop in russia is either the flower indigenous to that country or the victim of crime whose dead body is buried in snow only to surface out when the snow thaws i'd like to write more but i despite having finished only the first two paragraphs above i had already gotten 12 votes so i guess my gr friends prefer reading short reviews so i better end this now you see i wrote a long 6 paragraph review this morning but when i clicked the save button gr said the review does not exist so i had to reconstruct my review but it was already 8 00 a m and i needed to start working","362":" pretty sad depressing book on several levels it's kind of an old fashioned dare i say trite film noir type story wherein a slightly stupid dweeby british man blindly but willingly falls for a not so nice lady in this case two ladies who are using him setting it in russia gives it a certain freshness and interest though i have to say that i felt like i had read and seen this same story a thousand times before with the exception of the russian themes there was nothing about the story or the author's telling of the story that was particularly inventive or interesting indeed he pretty much telegraphs what is going to happen right from the start so much of the novel is spent watching it all unfold i'm not an expert on russia so for all i know the author is painting a very accurate picture of modern life there and there will perhaps be profound overtones for some i will say that he certainly doesn't paint a very appealing or attractive russian picture where most of the women are prostitutes most people are corrupt and folks are killing each other to get a better apartment i suppose i can understand why the book has gotten praise it certainly isn't sentimental right down to it's morally bleak ending it has definitely made me feel differently towards russia it's ultimately more of a tone poem on the bleakness and corruption in moscow and of certain passive middle class british men than it is a suspense thriller","363":"a guy's book well written contemporary depiction of moscow with dark tale in the background very bleak the narrator portrays himself as a kind of victim of sorts which is simply ludicrous please he's a 38 year old british lawyer from a middle class background dating a 20 year old russian girl whose background is unknowable but probably involves a lack of options when he isn't enabling dubious business deals he's in pole dancing bars and then well you'll see","364":"i liked this in spite of itself and myself initial exposure to the words 'psychological drama moscow and corruption' left me feeling cold and indifferent it only took the first 7 words though to warm my interest mc nick is a rather pale patsy professional ex pat who's inability to get very fired up about anything occasionally frustrates but then as this narration constitutes an explanatory letter to his future wife i guess less is more i felt the slightest let down at at the end granted true life endings often fizzle out in unimaginative dribbles but i was expected a little more after all the lessless still a read that kept me page turning well into the wee hours","365":"loved the snowdrop idea but sorry book didn't pull me in in what's described as a corrupt society kolya seemed way too naive for a lawyer","366":" i grabbed this book principally because it was a recent man booker list finalist but i figured the author's time as the economist's moscow correspondent would give him some great insights into modern russia he did not disappoint he effectively captures the phenomenon of the middle aged pudgy westerner hooking up with a too good to be true russian beauty in a way that doesn't seem stereotypical and there is plenty of this going on in the real world and effectively speaks of the day to day existence in a society where things only work for oligarchs and thieves the protagonist knows in a noirish way that none of it's going to end well but in a noirish way he keeps signing the papers and meeting the girl even though all the evidence is there that he's in trouble i felt like i sometimes did when it dawned on me that a moscow taxi driver was drunk or mad and i sat fingering the door handle in the back of his car and contemplating when to leap out all the time knowing that in fact i wouldn't i never did milller effectively uses foil characters to warn the protagonist away from what everyone knows is coming the visit from his british mother is almost painful as she experiences russia for the first time and her silent responses to it reveal so much more than the furtive mother grown son dialog i also liked the wino british reporter one of those lost foreign correspondents you read about in graham greene a citizen of the republic of cynicism another character used to anchor the protagonist in the reality of his fast eroding situation over a series of sumptuous boozy lunches he delivers lines like in russia there are no business stories and there are no politics stories there are no love stories there are only crime stories one wonders if this character is based on miller himself i enjoyed the nuances of things one only experiences in russia the banya like a sauna with ceremonies the moscow metro the common areas of its apartment buildings the nightclubs where nothing good or genuine ever happens and the ever present reminders of its violent and complex history snow drops is again the travelogue of a man falling in love with the wrong woman and i'd argue in a dr zhivago way with russia as he watches seasons change and mourns the loss of his own youth at the end of chapter 16 he sums up the book nicely that's what i learned when my russian winter thawed the lesson wasn't about russia it never is i don't think when a relationship ends it isn't your lover that you learn about you learn about yourself reccommend","367":"brillantly written superbly paced and i assume highly accurate evocation of modern moscow the story has an ongoing feeling of inevitability but not in a way that makes a conclusion obvious or pointless written in a 'new to me' style of being a written confession to the main protagonist's wife to be the story details his interaction with two russian girls an elderly babushka and his next door neighbour the characters are wonderfully developed and feel realistic and it's easy to imagine yourself in nick's shoes throughout even in the more morally dubious moments highly recommended","368":"this was a wonderful contrast to mo yan's 'big breasts u0026amp wide hips' that i had just finished reading incidentally just hear he's won the nobel prize for literature today good for him snowdrops was a great debut novel it was slow but suspenseful compelling and horrifying having never been to russia it was a fascinating picture of history and culture with some moving poignant observations slipped into the thriller like plot but really there was never any doubt the narrator was flawed immature morally weak and that a terrible revelation was due why do some reviewers want to like protagnists sometimes it is enough to elucidate and understand human flaws vanity self deceit arrogance u0026amp prejudice i enjoyed reading the spare and unadorned prose and very occasionally i came across a description or observation that was unexpectedly very moving u0026amp lyrical","369":"some of the descriptions of russia moscow brought back memories plot wasn't that interesting to me contemporary russia fiction","370":"interseting story and paints an atmospheric picture of moscow but you know what's going to happen from page one deliberately i suppose but i would have preferred a little bit of mystery","371":"http audioboo fm boos 426481 snowdr","372":"i'd call this a well constructed tale of personal destruction my rating reflects my personal feelings about the book the story it told not the quality of the product","373":"very enjoyable i liked how vividly moscow was described i'm looking forward to reading more by a d miller","374":"the corruption described existing in moscow was depressing to say the least a d miller is a good storyteller it just got a bit predictable towards the end made the 2011 booker shortlist","375":"best book i've read in the last 2 years can't recommend it highly enough","376":"'long listed for the booker prize' is printed on the front cover which makes the book seem almost damned by faint praise from the outset how are we not to know that the long listing for the booker doesn't run to three and a half sides of a4 and besides 'literature' shortlisted and winners are normally bloody shocking anyway its an enjoyable read can't see the moscow tourist board seeing it that way as the city is presented as a cold bleak heartless place the outcome is predictable and some of the plot devises like that the story is being re told after the fact to a girlfriend back in england seem unnecessary","377":"excellent story of seductio ad betrayal set in a lawless russia","378":"lots to like about this even if you are not particularly interested in contemporary moscow and ogligarchs and people who misbehave","379":"i loved this book i'm glad a sense of an ending won the 2011 booker but i can see why this was a contender it contains a lot about what it's like for an expat to live in moscow and it tells a good story but most of all it's a psychological story the slow unveiling of just what an inadequate unlovable man the protagonist is there were times when the pain of what was so obviously going to happen made me put the book down for a moment to catch my breath the form of the book is an account by him to his fiancee explaining what happened to him in russia and i have to say i hope she gave him back the ring when she read it days after i finished reading it the story and the characters are still with me this may be the reader's equivalent of the portrait's eyes following you round the room but for me it's one of the tests of a really good read","380":"such a dark book that it was actually hard to finish the author is very intelligent would be a great book club book","381":"fantastic book paints a really good picture of moscow in the early 2000's this was one of those books that i kept thinking about days after i finished reading it","382":" this isn't the book that i thought it was going to be big play is made on the blurb of the snowdrops of the title the bodies that come to light in the russian spring thaw but as a metaphor for the plot it is a bit strained it's a phrase i've come across before in kurkov's death and the penguin which likewise looks at the corrupt society created in the post soviet cash free for all but with a wittier manner so this book isn't the crime thriller it is dressed up to look like the atmosphere of moscow is authentically created and i recognised the city and the hotel i've stayed in very well when i visited it at about the time that the book is set though i maybe saw it through less cynical eyes than the main character however it is hard to feel for the english lawyer at the centre of it all as he is eternally telling you how the story will end he just comes across as a fool and the symmetery of the two storylines i found a bit too clunky i was a bit disappointed by it","383":"i nearly gave up as it took so long to get going it was ok although the main character was a fool which i know is the point but why be knowingly deceived i just felt irritated by him","384":"a good read for expats you'll see a lot of people you know in the charcters","385":"raced through it great storystelling","386":"a fascinating little suspense novella told in an eerily intimate way i love his turns of phrase well most of them his pacing his description of russian life in the early 00s and i think that the clever way in which he framed his story is a nice touch looking forward to more from this author","387":"definitely a griping story and much more satisfying than sense of an ending it gave an good impression of life in moscow and is relatable for anyone who has been a long term expat anywhere in the world particularly the comments at the very end about what he missed","388":"narrated in the first person as a confession to a fiance this was an enjoyable read but it fell apart for me at the end a bit","389":"think this would have made a better movie it was fun reading about moscow after having visited but i wasn't blown away by this mystery","390":"interesting book contemporary russia","391":"after enjoying a very interesting evening out in october listening to a andrew miller reading some great excerpts from and being interviewed about snowdrops i expected to be completely smitten with his novel unfortunately it didn't speak much to me at all and i put it down many times to read other books in between whilst being very atmospheric i can confidently say that i will never want to visit moscow in the winter and probably authentic regarding the corruption culture and lifestyle of well heeled russians and expats alike the actual plot was rather lame and predictable and the po faced yet seductive russian girl friend too clicheed for my liking i'm struggling to comprehend that snowdrops was considered let alone short listed for the man booker prize 2011 i can only concur with other disappointed readers that the jury must have gotten mixed up with the other andrew miller whose book pure i haven't read yet but some of my friends have written rave reviews about","392":"great read unexpected ending","393":"found this at the library and was attracted by the fact that the book was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 and the quote reads like graham greene on steroids daily mail i started reading and loved the atmosphere and the colourful description of modern moscow however the story itself about a lawyer that meets russian girl and gets introduced to her family and the subplot about the oil exploration isn't up to graham greene class it's an easy read and you want to know what happens next but after finishing the book you are left with the feeling that nothing much really happened instead of 250 pages this should have been a short story","394":" i can't decide between three and four stars so hopefully when i have finished writing about it i will have my answer see there are parts i really liked a lot and parts i couldn't quite get behind the same with miller's writing some of the description of moscow of the cold of money was wonderful other parts were less so i read part of a book called moscow casino by a journalist who lived in moscow from 1996 99 and described those days of capitalism run amok when a lot of westerns were taken for a ride and the russian mob was born one of miller's characters states in moscow at that particular time there were no business stories no political stories no love stories only crime stories that view is certainly in keeping from what i learned in moscow casino and if the main character of snowdrops had paid attention to what his friend said he would have saved himself a world of hurt but then we would not have been any snowdrop i like that it is short those epic multi generational big picture books aren't for me i like books that have chosen a brief time period a few days a season maybe a year and gives me the detail and atmosphere i need to feel i was there for the most part miller does this i liked the idea that it is today's nick looking back and telling this story but i didn't really buy the idea that it a fiancee he is writing too the nick we get to know during his moscow days is not a 'fiancee' kind of guy and while what happened in moscow should have changed him the nick telling us the story doesn't seem all that changed if he was changed there would be some feeling of redemption and there just isn't without redemption how could nick commit himself to someone or why that might be the better question why would he want to get married if he was not a very different person that the moscow nick i liked the cat and mouse story telling style miller uses i mean the reader knows right from the start before nick even introduces us to moscow in the 90's that something went awry and miller slips in the occasional reminder like how nick 'liked tatiana immediately and liked her right til the end' it's just a little reminder to the reader that nick is free and clear and if he's getting married presumably he is even happy but there is no sense that nick is happy now urrrrrgh this is a first novel and despite it's flaws or the things i don't like about it it shows a lot of promise so maye it deserves a four but it is flawed and when i think of the excellent books that have a four rating from me how can i give it more than a three","395":"snowdrops are bodies found under the snow when it melts in the spring in russia a british man becomes embroiled in an unsavory plot to bilk an elderly woman out of her apartment thanks to two sisters who turn out not to be sisters very atmospheric booker nominee","396":"although a book about russia and moscow it reads like a story familiar to expats everywhere it's also one of few books i've read in a single sitting recommended","397":" i wavered between 4 and 5 stars for this one but as lots of people only use 1 and 5 for extremes books end up being rated only out of 3 scores which leads to boring results so not quite a 5 but nevertheless i really enjoyed this one it was so pacy and tightly written that i read it in virtually one sitting the reader absorbs the menace on every page and guesses early on that the story is not going to end well it didn't but the ending was not an anti climax the descriptions of moscow with the cold the corruption the obsession with young girls and money have turned me off ever visiting the place the author spoke from experience as he had lived and worked there for many years but despite all that there was a real love of the city and an acceptance of all its shortcomings interesting read","398":" snowdrops is the debut novel and man booker prize nominee from ad miller the story follows a british lawyer called nick platte who has been living and working in moscow for several years he's basically one of those expats who isn't happy with his life but would be even unhappier if he went home one summer afternoon he saves a girl named masha and her sister katya from a mugging in the underground and soon becomes masha's lover however there is a mysteriousness behind the two girls which slowly draws nick into a dark and dangerous tale of duplicity corruption and murder i really enjoyed this book you know right from the start that something bad is going to happen but you're not sure what the evocation of the moscow scene and the criminal underground bribery and corruption is convincing miller is very good on weather and relating this to mood too the picture he paints of putin's russia seems authentic as are the echoes of the soviet past if you like a psychological crime thriller then give this a look","399":"read this book in one evening loved the descriptions of russia and the story was really suspenseful","400":"hateful and unrealistic narrator depressing story our book group's first ever book but not generally a popular choice","401":"i got this book as an advance readers copy at first i found the book compelling and the descriptions of moscow and its inhabitants in the early days of capitalism fascinating as i read further i was put off by the greed decadence and lack of caring by and for its main character nick platt even the landscapes as well as the writing became dismal and cold the cover is beautiful with a woman hiding behind the cutout of a snowdrop but what i found deceiving was this book being categorized as a psychological drama i think this will leave more readers disappointed than not i was hoping for some dramatic ending but felt it fell flat and like nick platt longing for something i just wasn't going to get","402":"not far in a slow start","403":"another dud in my recent quest to read outside my usual lit fic ghetto another reason not to it seems very sluggish and strangely naive despite back cover blurbs comparing miller with graham greene and describing the prose as confident a bit astonishing it was shortlisted for the 2011 man booker prize though that was the one whose jury was chaired by stella rimington who championed readability yeah readable on a ninth grade seventh level in this case blah i read on only for the atmosphere which managed to be semi interesting despite the cheesy lugubrious tone","404":" 2 5 starssnowdrops is just as much about nick's rather skewed love affair with moscow as it is his strange relationship with masha a mysterious russian girl if only it wasn't so stereotypical and one dimensional it could have been a pretty interesting book well it would also need to lose the unsympathetic main character flowery prose ridiculous word choices and the rather odd structure nick is apparently telling the tale to some future partner and that serves to eliminate a lot of the tension i was interested enough to see how the story ended but i didn't care much for the book the author's writing style was clearly laborious and contrived the observations on russian culture seemed authentic enough but lacked a sense of insight or sympathy that would have made it more engaging i spent most of the time wondering how a 38 year old character with such a taxing job could actually be that stupid and naive and irresponsible","405":"the details and descriptions of russia's dark side were interesting the overall story predictable","406":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the cover and the description on the back was what sold me to read this book i love books set in russia and in the snow anway and when the back descibed snowdrops as being the bodies that float up into the light in the thaw i thought i was set for a murder mystery set in russia maybe on a gorgy park vein god was i ever wrong what a disappointment that has got to be the most misleading back cover ever for once i was actually annoyed i got one body mentioned at the begining and the end the the cover and the description on the back was what sold me to read this book i love books set in russia and in the snow anway and when the back descibed snowdrops as being the bodies that float up into the light in the thaw i thought i was set for a murder mystery set in russia maybe on a gorgy park vein god was i ever wrong what a disappointment that has got to be the most misleading back cover ever for once i was actually annoyed i got one body mentioned at the begining and the end the same body by the way all i got was the english lawyer working in moscow who starting chasing after this russian girl who was actually using him for what spoiler turned out be some sort of property fraud scam what got me was he was supposedly writing a confession to his now fiance spoiler in which he pretty much told her that she was second best and if this russian girl who conned him walked through the door he would go back in a second there was no mention of what happened to the relationship but if he was actually stupid enough to give the confession he was writing to her then this guy deserved to get seriously dumped more","407":"an antithesis of 'eat pray love' this book seeks to shock disgust and titillate by revealing a slice of russian life every character in the book including the protagonist should be buried under the deep snow","408":"my friend gave me a copy after visiting russia having never been to moscow i found the backdrops to be rendered nicely and the snide tone while unoriginal was easy to ride for 250 breezy pages the characters were weak and perfunctory basically a familiarly cynical narrator and a host of russian stereotypes and you could smell the ending from a mile away everyone in the book is basically a prop for nick platt the disaffected british expat who has a love hate relationship with new moscow and its decadence to work out his own issues unfortunately nick and his issues are not compelling enough to be short listed for a booker prize still it's well written and a very quick read though perfect for the summer","409":" my friend katie was on a kick to read the man booker shortlist this year and she recommended this book to me really katie i love you but really this book is i think intended to be a noir thriller set in modern ish day moscow nick platt is an ex pat british lawyer who rescues two russian women from a purse snatcher and takes the opportunity to boink masha the older sister nick is then pulled into some sort of scheme but i honestly gave up before i got to a point where i could understand what this scheme was so this book is just really not for me in any way there are moments when the writing is quite nice particularly when miller is setting the scene describing the city itself it's a very atmospheric novel and i definitely liked that when miller was describing the action of the story itself though i found his writing to often be clumsy and even redundant for instance nick would say that was when she told me about her family and then proceed to give the blow by blow dialogue if you're going to give us the entire conversation we don't need to be told ahead of time what it's going to be about i also disliked the fact that the novel was structured as a letter to a lover fiancee that we don't ever meet that took all of the suspense out of it for me it was almost as if by relating things to her world i wore that aftershave that you think smells like horse piss it was sapping the tension out of the narrative why am i worried about what's happening with masha if you're focusing on things like that not that it was something that miller did to excess - there were really only a few instances - but i didn't see why it was necessary in the first place i might have been able to overlook some of the clumsy writing if i felt like nick was a character worth my attention but he's not it's not so much that he's flat he's just so juvenile and unlikable i think that he is meant to represent something about living in a moral vacuum but i couldn't quite put my finger on what miller was trying to do he's a juvenile emotionally detached man both exploiting others and being taken for a ride why do i care about what happens to him if he doesn't seem to care all that much i've read reviews that describe nick as an unreliable narrator which is certainly true the thing that got me though is that i couldn't tell if this was because miller was constructing him that way or if it was because of bad writing i feel like maybe i'm being too harsh here but something about this books was going over my head and there wasn't enough promise of a pay off to make me want to keep going","410":"weird hints of darkness gripping story set in moscow the characters are brilliantly brought to life and the imagery is great written in the form of a letter to his new gf about his old life in moscow the protagonist is an interesting character whose actions you may question my friend and i discussed at length how weak we felt he was but realistic the writer did well to provoke such discussion interesting backdrop of russia because russia has such a dark history i liked the ending","411":"this marked the beginning of my booker longlist slog this isn't a terribly complex novel but it certainly is a first in terms of documenting the empty torment of the yeltsin and putin state","412":"to the extent this novel gives some insight into moscow in the midst of the rise of capitalism it is interesting i did not however love the story i liked it less than i tend to like booker nominees it is short though","413":"i wanted to like this book i'm interested in getting to know about russia the author writes for the economist a magazine i rate and it was short listed booker or costa but i found the characters shallow the plot cumbersome not for me","414":"this book was ok i kept thinking at the what was the author really trying to say","415":"a good story but laced with an undercurrent of bitterness i have lived in odessa and kyiv and i can relate to the environment in which the author set the story but i remember it with a certain fondness anyone reading this book from that part of world is likely to take offence at some of the sweeping statements which are made about life and culture and attitudes","416":"i didn't like this it is a shame the beginning describing the found snowdrop got me into the book and then the author took us back in time for a life history of the character that unfortunately i found long winded pointless and boring as it was a book club book i was reading i persevered but skim read three quarters of this book and still found it not worth the hassle and wish i had just given up when it started getting boring about page 5 and use my time better reading a more enjoyable book","417":"hhmmmm quite dark and if i'm honest miserable sorry mr miller not overly enthralled i'm afraid despite you being a shortlister","418":"meh is the best description i have the descriptions of russia were wonderful but the characters seemed forced u0026amp i kept having to tell myself something interesting would happen eventually it didn't","419":"just about reaches 'mildly interesting' i can't believe the recommendations plastered all over this book comparisons with graham greene are tremendously hyped and misleading","420":"great page turner fast paced good characterisation and plot bleak perspective on moscow and many of its inhabitants","421":"i found the descriptions of russia as it emerged from communism interesting but the book was a bit of a disappointment","422":"read this one in a couple of days fast moving though predictable felt sorry for nick although he was portrayed as a weak character some good metaphors for life here","423":"interesting tho primarily because of setting still don't quite understand why it's written as if for a fiance seems to be an artificial construct","424":"amazing book with a lot of things to be aware of about people whether they are from russia or not","425":" this book has an easy harmonious flow thanks to miller's exceptional eloquence no wonder his career was that of a journalist with the economist regardless of whether one agrees or not with the ideological angle articles in the economist are extremely well written the book follows a gradual and inevitable downfall of a british lawyer desperately bogged down in two morally questionable deals one involving his law firm entering into a dubious business transaction with a moscow businessman and another transpiring from his infatuation with a pretty young russian girl a deal that turns out to be equally shady the novel outlines a gloomy picture of modern day russia where greed and poverty feed each other in an absolute moral vacuum and where disregard for human life and dignity is a norm nonetheless miller seems to suggest that no one is immune to this disease as the moral decline of the outsiders goes deeper and is inexcusable because not driven by necessity extremely topical in the current climate of austerity and disenchantment with the global economic system snowdrops will most probably remain what it is now a child of its time","426":"the author is too ignorant and incompetent to be objective the book itself is very shallow in content being false and deceitful to the very core at the same time when reading this whopping lie i felt like i'm being beaten robbed and finally raped the author knows a little less than nothing about modern russia and its population nevertheless pretending to comprehend the subject throughout i wonder how could this kind of book ever been nominated for booker prize i very much hope people who live in the west won't believe a single word of it reading this book was a waste of time and money","427":"read this for my terrestrial book club unfortunately it didn't live up to it's opening line well written descriptions of moscow but i found it impossible to like any of the characters and it was so obvious what was going to happen from very early on in the book also a very strange premise writing to your fiancee about a previous girlfriend","428":"i am led to believe that this is based on the author's personal experiences because the only reason someone could possibly believe that this story needed to be told would be if 1 the storyteller were as dull and self absorbed as the main character of this book and 2 if that self absorption led the storyteller to believe this story was worth telling simply by virtue of the fact that it happened to the only person worth paying attention to himself a classic example of the gather round as i tell you the story of the very interesting yet dangerous person i met and how they changed my life done badly the main character and narrator is a dull self absorbed milquetoast who heads to post communist russia in the hopes that a change of scenery will make his life more interesting he manages to get himself a girlfriend whose distinguishing characteristics are 1 she's young leggy and beautiful and 2 she's willing to have sex with the main character that's really it throughout their interminable meandering through bad russian cooking and dully hedonistic nightclubs seriously this narrator is so dull that he manages to make a strip show pantomine sound boring simply by virtue of making the reader experience it through the narrator's eyes and the occasional outing to a beach or some other pointlessly common picnic destination this girlfriend never has any true personality or character other than hot young woman who has sex with the narrator as the story progresses it becomes obvious that the main character is getting set up for a scam both in his personal life and his professional life but the main character is so dull that he bovinely goes along with both schemes because he just can't muster up the impetus to do or think anything the reader doesn't even get the intrigue of trying to figure out what the scams are or whether or not they're cons because not only are they ridiculously obvious but the narrator keeps foreshadowing them with ominous if only i'd known then what i know now exclamations then the full whammy of these cons decend upon him and nothing other than his narcissistic whining about how horribly deceived he feels he suffers no true hardship over his bad choices and the whole end is an anti climatic turd","429":"a spot on description of life in moscow on the 90s captures the hedonistic and wild east mentality of the time a bit obvious as a story very predictable anyone familiar with life in moscow during this time period will enjoy this quick read","430":"it is a pretty vivid and accurate description of modern moscow except that clearly miller hated it and makes it look horrible the main character is so pathetic the story is not very credible the naive lawyer that gets fooled by the russian chick and by the russian businessmen if he was that silly he would not have survived 4 years in moscow","431":"one intersting piece of trivia what we call indian summer they call grandma's summer in russia","432":"this was a quick read for me i found it to be suspenseful and gripping so much of the novel is about the weather and culture in moscow in the 1990's the oligarchs the oil boom the women the snow the fallout from communism the main character a british attorney falls in love with a russian girl but this is not a love story really enjoyed it didn't give it five stars mainly because i don't think it's a book i'd read over and over which is my criteria","433":"enjoyable the author has a superb command of analogy peeling open the story in technicolor layers","434":"for some bizarre reason the british lawyer protagonist of this dull and dreary effort spills the beans about a former love affair with a designing russian bimbo during a stay in moscow in a kind of reverse 'dear john' letter to his soon to be wife back in england heaven only knows what reason the author had for employing this absurd narrative device but along the way we're thrown crumbs of 'insider knowledge' about the new not very nice capitalist russia using the appropriate lingua franca in a way that suggests this is adequate compensation for the absence of a truly engrossing story it could have been entitled 'confessions of a dreary naive not very nice self absorbed ex p r at 'it doesn't surprize me one bit that this was shortlisted for the booker prize to be avoided at all costs","435":"i'm a sucker for indulgent expat novels throw in a moscow winter and i'm sold","436":"when i went to write this review i actually had to read a quick plot summary to remind me what it was about never a good sign it's not a bad book it seems to have insights into modern day russian society and lawlessness ... though i couldn't help but feel it was all stereotypes and cardboard characters the writing style was good but overall it had no real depth","437":"this book is described as a psychological thriller and while it conjures up vivid images of snowy corrupt russia i spent the first 3 4 of the book wondering when something was going to happen a bit too slow paced and lacking in tension for me but an easy enough read","438":" i liked the prose the language used didn't throw you too far into russian but the accents came across the characters felt real and absent in their thoughts there was that lack of feeling throughout and at sometimes that did make it difficult to relate to the main character whom i couldn't form an opinion of either way the idea of recounting the most romantic sexual experience of your life and writing it for your prospective wife to read was a bold move but i'm not convinced it worked and i'm even less convinced the character will be getting married at the conclusion of the story","439":"a good read on post communism russia interesting to see parallels with adiga's india a booker nomination though is a bit unwarranted","440":"a very atmospheric book i loved the insight in the hard dark life in modern moscow a british lawyer who lives in moscow lets himself get entangled in the rip off culture that seems to have become the norm both in his business and his private life it is the sort of book you want to read slowly so it does not finish too quickly beautiful writing and a gripping subject","441":"excellently captures the bleakness of the setting but because of that is ultimately too depressing to really enjoy","442":"a kind of lame male fantasy i'd choose columbo any day over this trash","443":"love this book great story inside a rendering of moscow in the mid 2000's gripping poignant tale of an expat knows moscow as well as any russian","444":"moscow at the turn of this century could be a dangerous place almost anything could be bought or extracted for a price and many people were for one reason or another in on some deal or scheme to get ahead in the business of money comfort or influence life was also fragile people disappeared without a trace only to turn up as snowdrops during the spring thaw with his debut novel snowdrops ad miller delves into the unfettered yet also manipulated period of early capitalism in russia that followed the collapse of the soviet regime part crime part love story miller's fast paced fluidly written and engaging novel combines these elements within a chilling psychological portrait of an expatriate corporate lawyer who has been living comfortably in wild moscow miller's book is on the shortlist for this year's man booker prize these are the russian gold rush days and nick nicolai ivanovich to the locals a british lawyer is caught up in financial and other dealings in more ways than one despite slowly realizing that all may not be as it appears with his new girlfriend masha her sister katya and tatiana vladimirovna their aunt and warnings from his cynical journalist friend steven walsh he cannot extricate himself from their influence rather nick prefers to adopt the popular advice of the day the less you know the longer you live in his business dealings nick is as gullible going with the flow money in moscow had its own particular habits he muses by way of explanation and justification for his actions money knew that someone in the kremlin might decide to take it back at any moment nick writes his story with hindsight confessing all as honestly as i can to his soon to be wife he hopes he admits to her that he was terribly naive and totally in love with the mysterious masha he was blinded by his urge to find the one who would take him out of his pathetic early midlife crisis mood he is still drawn to his life in moscow despite everything moscow can have that effect on those who have spent time there ad miller evidently knows those effects his intimate knowledge as correspondent for the economist of moscow and russia its diversity of peoples and its sociopolitical reality of the time adds to the story's authenticity and makes the locales more than a backdrop but rather a lively participant in the unfolding human dramas while we readers are fully absorbed in the novel's events sometimes understanding earlier than the protagonist the associations between different people's actions i could not help also thinking of developments beyond the confines of russia and the early twentieth century many of the issues that miller touches on are with us even if in different more subtle or hidden forms","445":"for a debut novel i think miller was pretty good it is a psychological thriller and the plot is placed in moscow at the beginning of the 21st century it's about the story of an elglish lawyer with evident influences of middle age crisis who decides to move and work to moscow in order to change his life however over there he will find out soon how easily you can become victim of fraud being used and that being naive can be really dangerous through the pages of this book miller presents a new moscow after communism days modern now with upstart trends and many excesses where money and corruption are dominating in all levels presence of women is certainly not missing from the book which gives the book and moscow in general a hedonistic character there are several interesting elements about the life in moscow the way people living and thinking the plot is quite catchy language is simple and it's a very fast and enjoyable reading i don't know if it's so good to win this year's booker but definitely you wont get tired and you are going to have a pleasant feeling after reading it however i think that obviously it's not a masterpiece","446":"this book tells the story of nick a uk lawyer who spent some years working in his firm's russian office and gets mixed up with a group of people who are not what they first seem nick tells the story to his current girlfriend in the hope that she will understand and maybe even forgive him for the way he behaved during that particular cold winter in moscow it ticks all the boxes as it builds up to its inevitable conclusion eventhough you can sort of guess where the final pages will take you a couple of chapters before it actually does end it does not stop being a page turner it is high paced and describes perfectly the image of russia as a harsh and in some ways cruel place where morals take a back seat and money rides up front it is also honest and acts a bit like a mirror for the reader in that it faces nick with a dilemma where the right decision is obvious but it makes you wonder if you unlike nick would be brave enough to make it","447":"a build up to an eventual climax a drama that slowly unfolds itself read it as a window to the underbelly of contemporary post communism russia through the eyes of a corporate high finance foreign lawyer in moscow","448":"i enjoyed the russian setting and thought the unfolding plot was well done not exactly an optimistic book but it does fit the mood of our times","449":"a thriller with russia mostly moscow as one of the major characters the setting of this novel is key with its transition from summer to autumn then winter then spring summer the main male character is definitely going through a type of midlife crisis but naively allows himself to be embroiled with two young russian women who are out to exploit him there is a body in this novel but that isn't the main focus of the story but it seems that no one in the novel truly adheres to the law","450":"slow burning but gripping at the same time i loved the way the different strands of the story slowly built towards their increasingly inevitable conclusions the imagery and descriptions of the people and scenery of modern day russia were vivid and striking i also really liked the narration style of the writer addressing the story towards his fiancee","451":"this book was ok i agree with some saying that it is a slow burner because you feel as though something dramatic is going to happen but it doesn't the problem with this was the blurb it sells the book as something verging on a thriller the way that it describes what a snowdrop is as russian slang but when you read it you discover it to be a tale about deception with not one scene that i would call overly 'dramatic' also the author likes to use full names regularly which stretches out the reading process","452":"an easy read part mystery thriller although nothing especially thrilling ends up happening and part travel commentary on the new russia fascinating i am surprised that this made the man booker longlist this year because although it is reasonably well written it is not outstandingly amazing or unique a good absorbing book for a long flight","453":"a fine book but i had my usual trouble with russian novels remembering all the names apart from that i liked it a lot","454":"this is another booker long lister about an englishman who is drawn into trouble by a couple of russian women one of whom he falls for heavily and who finds out that he is not perhaps who he thought he was but that these woman pegged him from the start i found it hard to be engaged by any of the characters","455":"how we deceive ourselves","456":"this is a short book interesting my two most recent books were short almost novellas written as a letter to his fiancee the protagonist recounts six months working as a lawyer in russia beautifully written very descriptive yet written economically so nothing gets in the way not sure if that makes sense but i really liked it the only challenge is that i m not 100% sure what happened at the end but interestingly doesn't quite matter","457":"a cynical brit and his life and times in post soviet moscow shortlisted for the man booker it ambles from scene to scene some of which spark others are more damp squib nothing much happens that you couldn't predict from early on in the books and it all wraps up in a neat ending again no surprise","458":"it would be impossible not to appreciate this book if you've lived in moscow as i have for any period of time over the last two decades the writing is not amazing although it was nominated for booker this year but the descriptions of what life people weather are like there was spot on","459":"like plucking my eyebrows stifling inertia the book sums it up nicely itself towards the end what had happened a woman sold an apartment some girls had moved away nothing had happened","460":" this was barely 3 stars the idea and setting were interesting but i couldn't help thinking that the author could have done so much more with the main character and story it was full of foreshadowing with what turned out to be a fairly predictable denouement also it painted such a bleak picture of post communist russia suggesting a world of opportunistic and scheming people without much subtlety i assume that from a russian point of view it may seem stereotypical i would be curious to read to contemporary russian literature","461":" taking place in russia this book intrigued me especially the moscow slang of a snowdrop the book starts at the end and the main character goes back to the beginning as he pieces together the pieces of the events that took place over the last year nick the main character is working in moscow he is from london he is a lawyer who happens across two young russian women who befriend him and show him another side of russian the adventure takes him on a legal journey through the russian government and the bribes that must take place in order to transactions to take place he meets masha and katya's older aunt and they employ his services to help them switch apartments as life is happening nick becomes suspicious if these ladies are who they say they are as well as starting to question the motives of the women it was interesting reading this author's perspective of russia and specifically moscow","462":"moscow sits at the centre of this easy read a little tongue in cheek thriller i had an enjoyable time reading it recommend it to thriller lovers","463":" this year's booker shortlist has somehow passed me by but longlisted snowdrops interested me because it's set in russia and i've embarked on a bit of a russian readathon in preparation for my trip next year however i'm hoping that the author has taken a good deal of fictional licence with his setting because it paints an alarming picture of post communist moscow ubiquitous drunken taxi drivers for a start it's a psychological thriller quick and easy to read though not quite unputdownable i found the central character is a rather dreary young english expat lawyer seduced by more than just the pretty russian girls who chat him up one day on the metro in post stalinist moscow nicholas prat platt sorts out contracts for major construction companies and it's no spoiler to alert you to the fact that the project he's working on is corrupt because any mildly competent reader will work that out in five minutes flat we all know about corrupt russian oligarchs anyway right but the big giveaway is that nicholas is confessing this unedifying tale to his new fiancee and he very soon tells us more than enough to know that he's done things he's ashamed of so the interest is only partly to do with what he's done with whom and how but more importantly the 'why' the author is interested in how easily people can lapse into moral turpitude if to start with they have no strong ethical background - or what we used to call a 'conscience' it's probably no coincidence that the central character is a lawyer though in the light of recent scandals in britain it could just as easily have been a politician or a news executive... to read the rest of my review please visit http anzlitlovers com 2011 10 07 sn","464":"very overrated novel can't believe it got a booker nomination","465":"this is beautifully written but nick is irritating and unsympathetic and there is not enough of a story to make it work for me","466":"i don't know why the publisher or reviewers insist on calling this story a thriller it's a thoughtful dreamy tale that takes place in post soviet moscow the details of the city and the culture are impressive but if you're looking for a thrilling read this book isn't it the mystery in the story is hardly a mystery as even the protagonist knows what's really going on early on which makes it a bit frustrating when he just willingly goes along with it because the girls duping him are hot it's not a bad book in fact the descriptions are lovely and interesting especially for anyone looking to visit russia but just a warning no part of this story is a thriller there is no urgency to the plot no twists or turns that aren't broadcasted from the beginning","467":"a well written novel but have been left wondering about the reason for this book a sense of purpose it is written as an explanation why it has been written is not clear a mystery the characters are strong and the writing keeps the reader engaged","468":"almost a thriller based on a british solicitor nick working in oil rush moscow the book is written as a letter or address to the narrator's future partner girlfriend or wife nick is not a nice man but is a recognisable character it is very amusing in the way it describes the fatalistic way that the russian characters deal with situations if you have spent any time in moscow you should read this as you will recognise many of the russian ways essential reading for expats why almost as a thriller there are no surprises this must be deliberate due to mr miller's foreshadowing it provides a sickening sense of inevitablity in land grabbing post soviet russia","469":"welcome to moscow the city of duplicitous speculators thieving chancers corrupt villains well endowed women and hapless nick from england who is doing a few years as a lawyer in the russian capital descriptions of the city its people and the trials of life engendered by the often inclement weather give the storyline a superb background peppered with little snippets of information that will never fail to inform and entertain it is the story of nick a russophile who encounters masha and katya on the subway which is beautifully described by the author his descriptions will resonate with anyone who is familiar with it the old part of the moscow metro in the city centre is the sort of subway system you get if you give a tyrannical maniac all the marble onyx and disposable human beings he can dream of but i digress he falls for masha and his commitment to her grows as they wade through the mokri sneg damp snow ski in the city head out to a dacha and help 'aunt' tatiana vladimirovna to relocate from the centre of the city to butovo on the outskirts there are several storylines that are interwoven in this delightful novel that reads as quickly and intensely as if it were a novella the body that turns up when the snow melts the snowdrop of the title the kossak who keeps nick and paolo his boss at work well occupied the conspiracy of girls and of course the city itself a pleasure to read and even more so for those who are familiar with the city","470":"i loved this book it's the sort of novel that stays with you for a long time afterwards i've ever been to mscow where it's situated by now feel i'm intimately acqainted with the place read it it really is a modern times graham greene","471":"i found this story gripping enough to keep me page turning but it fizzled out for me too predictable an ending i kept waiting for something wow to happen a d millers description of a moscow winter and the big thaw in spring was brilliant i felt i was there","472":"i enjoyed this enormously the author really manages to give a feel for russia u0026amp the corruption that still went on there post iron curtain you really sympathise with the 'hero' highly recommended best book i've read for a long time","473":" disappointed in the description of psychological thriller i expected so much more that being said i thought the thriller or mystery was average i had it pretty much figured out from the beginning the character development was poor i really couldn't feel the relationship between masha and nicolai in turn i really didn't care what happened the best part of the book was reading about moscow unfortunately it portrayed russians as untrustworthy conniving lying people this would have made a good book club pick would have loved to hear what lana and nora would say","474":"i loved the tension and suspense created in this story of how a basically good person could let themselves slide down the slippery slope to participation in a scam","475":"i enjoyed this very much although i agree that the characters feel a little like 2d stereotypes that said there is little question that moscow is the real character here if i were the russian tourist board i'd be pretty unhappy the descriptions of the people and places are fascinating but have put me off visiting entirely four stars for the easy read and credible descent of the willing protagonist","476":"beautifully written though it is quite unsettling","477":" snowdrops is a slow burning thriller that gradually unfolds on the page it is a very voice driven story and i found nick the protagonist to be an open and accessible narrator who builds suspense with very little drama most of the story recounts nick's day to day life dates with masha and katya visits with their aunt tatiana vladimirovna business deals with his law colleagues and lunches with nick's journalist friend steve walsh but it is quickly apparent that something deeper and more ominous than nights at bars and lunches with vodka shots happened to nick that last year in moscow you just need to read until the end to find out what happened...","478":" a good read the author gives his characters authenticity i was reminded of how easy it is to be controlled by our environment and take the easy route for expedience and love i was reminded also of a book i read some years ago on a similar subject jack womack's 'let's put the future behind us' a satirical raunchy romp with the russian oligarchs and their girlfriends which i enjoyed in snowdrops the characters are much more believable the main characterstruggles with his self delusion and this is dealt with in a subtle way not knowing moscow i felt as though i now have some understanding of themuscovites in the novel coping with intense cold shiver and the aftermath of rapid change in the political climate after the fall of soviet russia being elderly i really felt for the victims and the death of trust and yet i could not despise the girls","479":"i'm puzzled as to why this was on the booker shortlist it's clever but not that clever and it's not that well written either but it passed an evening","480":"$1 at the library sale shelf i'm donating it back so not a horr eh i enjoyed the author's details of moscow life and weather but the narrative construct a sort of confession to his fiance if i recall correctly is silly unrealistic and intrusive the novel didn't really grip me until about 60 pages from the end by then i was just going through the motions while i didn't dislike the protagonist he was rather colorless the most interesting character was masha i purchased this book for $1 at the library sale shelf i'm donating it back so not a horrible book by any means but not one worth keeping","481":"loved it very dark atmospheric and the slowly mounting menace are superbly written and beautiful to read","482":"fast engrossing read about a british lawyer adrift in contemporary moscow in the early 2000s the author who spent time in russia as a correspondent for the economist paints the city as a latter day sodom and or gomorrah an amoral decadent sink hole awash with scams and scammers where everyone is either predator or prey and where nothing can be taken at face value that said though miller can definitely write about place his characters are fairly one dimensional and lack the beauty even artistry of his geographical descriptions and his hero is rather dull and lifeless perhaps that's deliberate but i doubt the overall plot is meant to be so completely transparent as well though there's lots that's hinted at during the early part of the book there are never any plot twists that actually surprise the big surprise is that this book was on the long list of 2011 booker nominees it's good but simply not that good still the location is colorful and gripping and the story of how the 'hero' is duped sustains the reader even if it's rather like road kill you can smell it before you see it but you just don't want to look away","483":"yuck dark dreary depressing however on the positive side the way that russia the way of life and its people are greatly detailed it is enjoyable and really does paint a clear picture for the reader as if they were there on its icy streets also i found the main characters naievity and shortcomings somewhat relatable or endearing as he was at least open about these to the negative aspects it left my mood very melancholy for that is the tone of the book with its seedy characters throughout i was not keen on the plot and it was a short read it lacked any clear genre its clearest aim was to be political perhaps","484":" i wavered between four and five stars but came down on five because of the sheer sang froid of the prose in the hands of another it might easily become garish or over the top my last visit to moscow was 22 years ago as communism was crumbling i was there for almost a month march april trying to nail down a joint venture with a publishing company that was plainly a kgb front but instead i watched it unravel like a bad sweater in slow motion i was in my mid 40s and i was assigned an interpreter the same age a third generation member of the communist party and married to a junior member of the politburo apparently part of her assignment was to seduce me at which she failed sorry i am happily married and never went in for such things i was saddened to learn she was demoted for having failed to do so and a breath taking beauty was then assigned to me she too failed why do i go off on such a tangent because i was wined and dined by nomenklatura communist elite while people around me went without and since the fall of communism things are only marginally better for the little guy i am certain that there are wonderful kind and moral people in moscow perhaps outnumbering the creeps but of all the world capitals i have visited moscow was the most tawdry a d miller's book set around 2005 brought back all my negative feeling toward the glittering side of moscow recounted in the first person the narrator addressing his fiancee the narrative maintains a constant tautness","485":" i found an english language book club at the library here in brno snowdrops is the book for april so i read it just in time for the meeting this week it was nominated in 2011 for the man booker prize and the crime writers' association gold dagger award the story focuses on a late thirties english lawyer nick who is living in moscow and going through an existential crisis it is written as a first person narrative him portraying the worst thing he did in his life to his fiance before they officially marry read more on my blog here http conflictedcauldron weebly com","486":"i enjoyed the insights into russian culture the most the storyline was okay but drawn out too much the twist was so obvious the whole way through that it just seemed painful","487":"this does not read like a man booker prize shortlisted novel which is why i bought it it's no wonder it didn't win but still it's an entertaining read it shows a little of the angsty qualities of graham greene as some blurbers suggested it does but on his best day miller is just barely imitating the master","488":"pacing and narrative weren't to my tastes but still a wonderfully engaging novel mysterious characters and a hapless protagonist mental note avoid moscow","489":"not written particularly well in my view but liked to read about the culture and way of the world in russia a place i have never been to and still doesn't appeal to me after reading the book","490":"i really enjoyed the descriptions of russia in this book i really felt like i was standing in the snow in moscow the writing style was also interesting the main character however seemed surprisingly unfazed by his various adventures i would definitely recommend this book","491":" the device of a long confessional letter to a forever girl friend is tiresome in its unremitting irony yet there is much to be ironic about in the russia of today miller's protagonist nick platt is a thirty something british lawyer muddling through a pipeline deal in moscow when he meets two beautiful girls masha and katya in the metro with his able guides masha katya and a sinister insider unrelated to the girls and called the cossack nick becomes embroiled in love politics and a criminality can we forgive him finally nick thinks not if you hate russia you'll love this book","492":"this book will stir something in you and soon the reader becomes the protagonist simply amazing","493":"brilliant simply stunning just like the russia snowdrops depicts miller's tale is sparsely written and draws you in slowly hooking you before you realise and only letting you go when it is done with you","494":"a quick read a hustler type story i enjoyed this","495":"this fast moving confessional style story was engaging and a quick read but wasn't really my cup of tea i didn't really believe the narrator would reveal this story of his previous love lust and complicity in a crime and perhaps even murder to his fiancee unless he hoped to be rid of her by the end ultimately this book convinced me that moscow must have been swarming in debauched ex pats at the turn of this century indulging in pleasures of the flesh while trying to keep that flesh from freezing pass the vodka i'm onto a new novel","496":"made it to the man booker longlist for 2011 i loved this book phenomenal in every respect","497":" imagine a full length book about a foreign man finding his host country and its native inhabitants to be repellant and backwards no it is no heart of darkness now imagine a wobbly sort of second person modified superstructure addressing a future fiancee in a series of notes on prior life experiences that demanded disclosure and forgiveness i got the strong sensation reading this that i'd love to sit down the author say interesting draft and advise just a wee bit more substantial scaffolding you be the judge ye humans","498":" 3 stars is generous really more like 2 1 2 a disappointing beginning to my annual bookerthon i disliked the protagonist and although the plot was interesting enough i thought a lot of the foreshadowing was too heavyhanded but the biggest problem i had was with the cliche ridden portrait of russia and the stereotypical treatment of the characters of masha and katya i will say that the protagonist proved to be somewhat more layered in the closing chapters of the book than he had seemed earlier so there was some depth there not sure why this made the booker longlist it's well written but nothing about it struck me as particularly special","499":"really enjoyed this book despite being a bleak description of modern day russia only criticism is the end was a bit predictable for much of last half of the book still would like to read more of his work","500":" i found the booker furore fascinating this year though i only felt a little involved in it as i had only to date read one of the books and it was this snowdrops in terms of 'literary merit' vs 'readability' well i felt that this book had both sparsely and evocatively written this book is a psychological thriller yes but also touches on the lies we tell ourselves and other people about guilt culpability and responsibility all elements i think of a book with 'literary merit' the one element that didn't work so much for me was the cossack i think that the author was going for some deliberate obfuscation here but there was a little too much secrecy and shadow i think perhaps i didn't get it because i was too caught up in the 'love' story perhaps a second read will show up different things to me","501":"after the fall of the ussr moscow became the new sodom and gomorrah excessive nightclubs exclusive restaurants and a continuous nightlife made the city a playground for the new russian rich especially former kgb officers foreign businesses bankers and lawyers were the willing advisers for legal not so legal or definitely vicious contracts and deals nick platt a british lawyer tells the story of how he met two beautiful russian girls how he enjoyed with them the moscow nights how he falls in love with one of them and how he gets involved to help their aunt by selling and purchasing a condo but we are in russia where moral values are falling down and where everything might not be what it looks like including the snowbanks snowdrops is a moscow expression for the bodies that are found when the snow starts melting captivating story warm in the beginning but ending in a film noir like freeze a story that will stick with you","502":"ah another one finished my man booker 2011 pile is getting lower this one without a doubt is my favourite yet the writing is succinct and full of great descriptions with a boy band fringe a ten thousand dollar suit and a murderer's smile he was equal parts twinkle and menace i would've given it five stars but the end it needed didn't appear it was clear where the book was going very early on the characters did their part and stumbled towards their finales and as i put it down i felt more of a pfft that an aah that said i haven't enjoyed an authors voice so much since anne michaels's fugitive pieces a very impressive debut novel and in my opinion worthy of the praise which is why i'm somewhat curious about the number of one and two star reviews on this site different things for different people i guess","503":"very dull plodding plot","504":"the author of this book kind of reminded me of jonathan tropper this is where i leave you if he had written an expat thriller ish book i liked some of the lines about russia and he set good scenes and stock characters but the plot was pretty simple","505":" not my cup of tea at all i was hopeful when i started reading this book as it was a nominee for the man booker prize poetic and emotional read i read in one review the synopsis does not fit with the book i'd like to know the marketing editor who wrote it as it is like selling a vaxhaul cavalier as a porsh i can't say i liked the characters very much and was bored by the main characters moral dilemma's i didn't even learn anything much that i did not already know about russia and the putin regime i'm afraid of the hundreds of books ive read this is the bottom of the pile","506":"attention grabbing from the start this book was picked up and put down in a day and a bit if this is a true picture of moscow and vignette of st petersburg my desire to visit has melted away with the spring thaw","507":" first off miller did himself no favors by bestowing upon this book--and it's a beautiful design wintry fresh with that inveigling top photo blend of a miniscule bundled up couple traipsing across a walled corner of a desolate and frigid red square that is slowly fading to gray--the saccharinely absurd title of snowdrops it's the rubric one would give to a tale of candied bunny rabbits and cavity filled teeth--with perhaps a little meth tossed in to give it some scratch--in a laminated child's romp through santa's workshop at the north pole what miller has actually constructed here an expat's confession of sleaze snow deception and reach arounds in the modern neon crush and bone chilling materiality of a moscow where almost anything goes and what you can't protect is there for the taking would have worked better with a handle that tasted bitter and aroused images of shadows slipping away like curdled morals from an arctic sun snowdrops all prancy and poncy sets the reader back tips him off balance before the spine has even been creased so perhaps it's a minor miracle that it actually reached enough people who count to have been short listed for the man booker prize there seems to be a not inconsiderable number of people who having read this book expressed their surprise--in tones of bewilderment indignation disbelief and or bemusement--that it made it that far that it is a sign of what the man booker has stooped to in this electronic era that such a meagre offering was even considered for the award in the first place there are also those who don't care for the large font size of the work--and peoples i hear you--what with the simpleton aura it brings to the whole who find the epistolary conceit of the narrative a confessionary letter from a rather loquacious groom to be to his one dimensional and ill formed fiancee to be a gimmicky tack on that does little but offer a thin hook upon which to hang the weaselly bastard who deem the grifts that are at work within unfolding in multiple directions upon multiple personages to have been so obvious and telegraphed that absent a suspension of disbelief that the author neither requests nor warrants the entirety simply cannot stand as conceived and the preeminent complaint in the reviews that i've both read and glossed over that the narrator nick platt an expatriate english lawyer living in moscow during the early to mid years of the first decade of our new millennium--a time when moscow was transitioning itself from being the living embodiment of cowboy capitalism to something dressed in finer clothes carrying itself in a more worldly manner demanding for itself a higher level of respect while remaining just as willing almost eager to cut your throat at the slightest sign of weakness--is such a gutless morally malleable wishbone pricklet of a man that unable to garner a shred of sympathy for himself from the reader his presence leaves the entire affair with an unpleasant odor a befouling feel that lingers unsatisfactorily after this grim little workout has been put to rest is all of this a bit harsh i think so in one of the review blurbs on the back the author is pumped up as being graham greene on steroids and while i don't hold him to be at the level of that great and prolific catholic englishman miller writes with a simplified elegance and a direct lyrical touch that while occasionally threatening to descend to the rank of the merely serviceable never actually does indeed it proves to possess itself of a power all of its own for i motored my way through snowdrops in two settings and was absorbed the entire time it produced no starbursts no flushes of joy but i was never less than intrigued and at all points entertained the story aside the real star of snowdrops is miller's pitch perfect in the telling depiction of modern russia its wild antics and chaotic violence in the clutch and grab days of the nineties anarchy after everything had fallen to pieces and the more upscale more outwardly charming more rakishly debonair but equally ruthless state of affairs in the twenty first century as a country aware of its riches in natural resources and determined to drown in western capital if that's what is required the wealthy in moscow revel in obscene prodigality in hopping via armored suv from one luxuriously decadent music pulsing and thoroughly energized nightclub to another each one prized for its unique manner of posing nude young women while the eminently corruptible police politicians and judiciary make it a place of endless possibilities for the rich one of endless misery and withdrawn chariness for those--the vast majority--who are not similar to greene miller excels at painting the life of an expat in convincing colors in getting to the heart of both what appalls and attracts in a country where so many things are similar but never quite right where the allure of the barbaric cannot be separated from that of the forbidden and in any case proving almost impossible to resist begins to abrade whatever served to separate the foreigner from the native--if it was ever more than illusion to begin with the story itself is relatively simple platt's a lawyer for a corporation that negotiates stipulatory contracts between european banks eager to lend money and the resource exploiting russian corporations that are desperate to borrow whilst in the midst of arranging a $500 million loan to a ruthlessly charismatic cossack--a man with criminal airs who heads up a consortium wishing to convert an old supertanker into a floating transfer port for an arctic oil pipeline--nick also finds himself falling for the older of a pair of sisters whom he rescued from a purse snatcher in the russian metro seeing in masha a steely sensuality that is irresistibly attractive nick finds himself pursuing this tawny slavic gazelle--whose beautiful and charmingly naive younger sister katya accompanies her everywhere--even while the two girls retain about them a beguiling distance a sense of mystery after masha's throaty growls and bedroom acrobatics have convinced the approaching middle aged professional that he has fallen in love he is introduced to the girl's aunt an elderly lady named tatiana vladimirovna a plucky survivor of the siege of leningrad and communist misrule who requires nick's services to assist her in a move to a moscow suburb however with the brutal cold and crunching ice of the seemingly endless russian winter serving as temporal marker nick's relationship with these lopsidedly smiling russian kinswomen and that of the twinkle eyed cossack impatiently awaiting his money come to reveal themselves in a troublingly sinister light the game as they say is afoot i suppose it could have been done better--the evolving attraction between nick and masha shown at work upon the page rather than appearing formed in statements a better device than the abrasively cynical stripper ogling reporter long exiled to moscow crafted to deliver expositions upon the state of modern russia but these complaints are fairly tepid because miller takes this material--and it's shopworn folks been done more or less in countless books previously pumped from the press--and makes it work maximizes his limitations and reveals some pretty impressive strengths what's more the final two complaints i etched above--that nick's gullibility in select areas is unbelievable and that his character is a grade a prick--present themselves as no problem at all for such as myself i've been a spineless worm failing to do the right thing if an easy relatively painless way out was made available i've been blind to what was obvious in a desperate attempt to make something that was false that had too many pieces that simply didn't fit out to be something that just might--if the eyes were squeezed shut tightly enough and the fingers kept crossed with a bruising fervor--prove itself true in the end i've suppressed suspicions itchy doubts that threatened to shatter an edifice i'd painstakingly erected to let in some needed light i've been nearing forty and alone in a crowded city and looking around wild eyed for a taste of those young days when the tank was always full and the air was wet with the promise of what might be in other words hell yeah i've been nick stood in his shoes made his bad choices that's why at the end i felt more sympathy for the man than dislike and that's a testament to what miller was able to access and bring to the page in this pleasantly surprising read","508":" i very much enjoyed this book even though it turns out to be rather a sad story the feeling that nothing was quite as it seems is carefully and cleverly woven throughout the story written as if to a friend and you have rather a lot of empathy with the main character i also love the detail about moscow in this book a place i want to visit and a place which certainly judging from the detail in the story where you need to keep your wits about you it's a very atmospheric book very dark and utterly believable it's a well crafted story not dissimilar to the short history of tractors style and i'd happily read another like it","509":"this book slightly held me at arm's length but i think it was intended to moscow is stunningly evoked a bleak eye opener on the corruption that drives post soviet russia and how corruption corrupts the narrator is making full confession to his english fiancee would you marry him","510":" this quickly paced highly readable novel almost more like novella paints an intriguing mysterious landscape of moscow in the 2000s i honestly had no idea the amount of money that western countries carelessly poured into russia during this time and miller's account is fairly credible as he contributed to the economist while living in russia during this time however with all the sex money and manipulation present the novel's ending is an anti climactic buzz kill the narrator not so innocently carried away in his own russian fantasy feels the impending doom so much so that the amount of foreshadowing in the novel becomes nauseating but with all that pent up suspense the ultimate payoff is not nearly juicy scandalous or shocking as it needed to be","511":"this book was shortlisted for the booker last year which along with the similarly overhyped 'child 44' i would present as evidence that booker judges are as fallible as everybody else this book is by no means a failure it's an examination of the new russia a world which most people seldom get to see so for that reason alone it's worth a read as a crime novel though it's a failure too little happens and that which does is telescoped way before the end the book is also lacking in other areas it's handicapped with a plot framing device -- a confessional letter to an absent fiancee -- which is hackneyed laboured and unnecessary and the protagonist has the dubious honour of being both intensely dislikeable and more than usually stupid consequently the reader cares nothing for his fortunes be they financial or romantic both of which are imperiled in this slight tale of snow bound petty larceny","512":"a d miller's first novel snowdrops has been shortlisted for the 2011 man booker prize one of the british commonwealth's most prestigious writing awards it's a fine novel telling a story that hasn't been told elsewhere what moscow looked like felt like how it did business and how it was criminal in the days just after the fall of the soviet union","513":"this is really a book about moscow great sense of place","514":"a stunning book sort of frustrated me with how the protagonist seems simple minded or just does not care enough th last few chapters grip you and you start feeling the cruelty of russia's past in your bones the ending largely made me wonder whether someone would still accept you when you have poured out every bit of your soul out in written form how much is too much seeping with apathy in its pages i would not recommend anyone to read too much of this genre it is too disheartening","515":"didn't live up to my high hopes i felt the author was making the same point over and over again annoying central character nice setting though for further thoughts http thekingfisherscrapbook blogspo","516":"thoroughly enjoyed this nick is finally telling his fiance about the four years he spent living in moscow probably because he has an admission to make which doesn't happen until the last line and is a great ending he became someone quite different to who i think he thought he was but at least he realised this and was able to be honest about this time selfish possessed reckless and thoughtless even unkind but quite unable to stop himself the things we do for love eh recommended it is quite different can't think who miller reminds me of but i am looking forward to whatever follows pretty impressive for a first novel","517":" this was not anything like i expected it was wonderfully well written and a very engrossing read the main character was someone i could not feel any sympathy for but this does not detract from the story actually i think it somehow improved the book for me the book was written as if nick the main character is telling his story to the woman he is going to marry i must say i would be surprised if the wedding took place after she read this not because of his role in what happened but because he so obviously is still in love with someone else i would highly recommend this book but i don't think it will be for everyone the depiction of russia in this book made it for me anyway almost a character itself and i do think that added such a lot to the story i would like to read more about the country as it's made me realise that i don't know as much as i thought i did","518":"surprisingly dull and tedious with little feel for decent characters or even a tangible sense of place the plot feels sketchy and utterly under developed it actually feels like the author lost interest and was struggling with threads two stars is being generous","519":"if you are thinking of adding russia to the list of places yu absolutely must visit this chilling story of deception naivety and murder will very likely change your mind","520":"good writing but i couldn't connect with the characters the author's description of russia is what westerners view it being like and based on what i've read and visits to st petersburg and estonia it sounds accurate","521":"quite obvious in so many ways and i thought the characters quite 2d but because i've just moved to moscow and enjoyed his descriptions i'll give it four","522":"why did i waste my time a little fun recognizing places but definitely not a thriller and the narrator is a total bore","523":"very atmospheric and well written","524":"riveting gripping despite what the reviews say about this book it has been one of the most boring reads of the year for me you can see where the plot is going after the first few pages but it takes ages to get there and by the time you do get there you couldn't care less the characters are flat stereotypical and not likeable at all which doesn't help i still can't believe this book was shortlisted for the booker prize it is definitely one of the worst reads of the year for me","525":"very descriptive and evocative of modern moscow corruption but not really a crime thriller well written but more of a novel than a mystery","526":"good noirish expat story in post soviet russia","527":"average the twist can be seen a mile off","528":" view spoiler this is the confession of a mark a mark moreover who has been used as a shill in part of a wider con nicholas platt the mark shill is now getting married and in an effort to wipe the slate clean and begin a new life he has written his account of his final year of living in moscow as honestly and succinctly as he can unable to speak his mind openly the book then plays on our confidence it's written in a way that invites us to trust the narrator's account but also to doubt him platt is a weak man who likes to think he is strong and the fall out of that after being conned is that he identifies himself as the shill not the mark he chooses to believe that his relationships with the con artists were real and that they conned the mark successfully together that's the trauma that continues to haunt him at once placating and irritating him platt's a lawyer though he isn't stupid he knows he's deluding himself the conceit at the heart of the novel is that he is an intelligent man who knows he's been used but would rather present to the outside world and more importantly to himself a story in which he figures as much as an accomplice as the injured party he knows he can't legitimately claim to have been an equal partner but he sets great store in hindsight i guess i knew then and i could have stopped but i carried on that's the stick he uses to beat himself with the effect he uses to blur the story and present himself as a stronger man than he really is he even tells us that the story begins with him rescuing a girl from a mugging an event we are led to believe at the then end of the book that was in all likelihood staged for his benefit a suitably macho beginning to his ego massaging exercise hide spoiler when it was announced this book was dismissed by some as a thriller somehow indicative of the dumbed down booker of 2011 i'd suggest that many of the people saying that hadn't actually read it true the book does open with a body but it's the only one and with one exception nobody in the book could care any less about solving that crime instead this is the story of a man in exile friendless even after living in moscow for three years whose unacknowledged yearning for human contact and social relationships away from work sees him drawn into a series of events that he can't quite square with his own self image a d miller's prose is masterful it's not flashy or overly verbose but utterly convincing in it's first person confessional nature inhabiting utterly the voice of the insecure remorseful middle aged bourgeois i'll be keeping an eye out for his next book","529":" not so long ago i asked a friend from moscow if he preferred living in hong kong our home at the time or if he missed moscow he laughed and said that if i had ever visited moscow i would not even have to ask that question this novel snowdrops gives me a good idea of what he meant the city itself is a character in this dark narrative about a british expat attorney whose desire for a beautiful russian woman propels him into particularly shady territory it is hard to believe that the protagonist would be quite that stupid but i guess this particular story of willful blindness is one of the oldest in the world overall i would say that the real reason to read this book is because the author knows moscow so well that his writing comes fully alive when describing the place the quirks of language and the people who live there my guess is that this visceral sense of place must have been the reason that the novel was on the booker prize shortlist in 2011","530":"i loved this book it was one of those books you read where a windoew on a whole new world a whole world of corruption of greed of an amoral struggle to get hold of the ruins from a previous era it is well written witty sharp and written in the style of an economist with unromantic perceptive insights into what a grab for wealth looks like brilliant","531":"told in the first person as a letter to his wife to be nicholas comes clean about his time as a lawyer in moscow and his involvement with not one but two pieces of corruption the first is bearable it's about his firm acting for their banking client in a new oil terminal in siberia the other is not nick becomes entangled with two girls cousins particularly the seductive masha who are persuading their ancient aunt tatiana to move from her apartment in moscow to a brand new one on the edge of the countryside he should have known better the second half of the book i found almost too painful to read i actually wanted to rush through it to get it over i guess from that aspect it was well written it did reach the man booker shortlist miller had spent some considerable time in russia as a journalist and it shows his descriptions of the city are detailed but enjoyable it was just when nick's mother comes to visit that it becomes too much of an obvious device to show off his knowledge of st petersburg in the end i found the plot a little too fanciful the banks relying on a single surveyor's report and nick not taking the many opportunities to untangle himself from masha but the promise of the week in odessa was always too much","532":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well written and a quick read but the main character was quite frustrating figured out where it was all going about half way through which made the second half fairly depressing really well written book and a good picture of russia during the wild east days but very bleak","533":"oops i didn't read this one","534":"this book was very enigmatic in more ways than one the descriptions were mouth watering making you feel as though you were really there with kolya in moscow butovo etc the characters alluring but also tantalisingly dangerous the best part of the book was the end 100 pages or so where the pace really picked up and you found yourself in a situation similar to watching the titanic wishing for the captain to miss the iceberg knowing they won't i devoured the end of this book and it has left me feeling hurt aching and exhilarated so much so i needed to review it now at 2 50am","535":" snow plays a big part in this psychological thriller seeming to hide all sorts of evils at one point the main character nick refers to it as \"annual oblivion...like temporary amnesia for a bad conscience \" just about all the characters in the novel deserve to have a bad conscience except for tatiana and oleg as much as i know of them anyway the snow covers up a lot literally and figuratively it also provides a backdrop for the setting of the novel in moscow and a framing device for the novel and its title snowdrops a snowdrop is actually a dead body that is buried in snow and only discovered when the snow and ice thaws out in warmer weather the book opens with the discovery of a snowdrop and the reader becomes drawn in to the story of who it might be and how it got there i was drawn in until the end for sure it was really an exciting read even though pretty dark and depressing in its tone the main character nick platt is a british ex pat lawyer in moscow by the end it's hard to decide about the nature of his character he has a lot to bury or try to forget in the snow too even though he is sort of buried in it slowly it is interesting to consider whether he is a good person or not i might have forgiven him and left with the feeling that he'd just gotten caught up in a terrible plot he definitely showed us the total corruption of people and the government in russia some of the things he gets caught up in or learns about aren't his fault but others well he definitely starts down a slippery slope and doesn't stop himself it's hard to forgive him though when you look at what he says in the end about his experiences he doesn't even seem sorry it's easier for me to decide about the immorality of his 2 young friends masha and katya they definitely knew what they were doing all the way along of course they do have the excuse that they grew up this way one assumes and that they were shaped by the society in which they lived nick had only been there 4 years i think i might just have quit the firm and clung on in moscow possibly tried to get a job with some up and coming steel magnate or aluminium baron if i'd still had masha i knew she didn't really love me--she didn't have to love me i would have carried on i think seeing her twice a week taking her home twice a week knowing there was no other or better me i could be somewhere else anchored to moscow by the heavy inertia of approaching middle age i don't think i'd have worried too much about how much of what she'd told me had been true or even about what she'd done i could have lived without tatiana vladimirovna i might have managed to forget about her so i think that masha was better than me in the end she had seriozha so she had a better excuse and she at least acted like she'd done something wrong i don't know who was in charge but i hope she got a decent cut location 2650 98% this is a really damning statement that nick makes it's harder to forgive him after that i wonder if his fiance will other sub plots also add to the theme of cover up and total corruption underneath the surface there is the cossack and the floating oil terminal that in the end doesn't even exist then the other sub plot concerns nick's neighbor oleg nikolaevich and his missing friend oleg utters many homilies throughout the book and it seems like he is like a greek chorus warning the reader about the truth that lies underneath the surface the white snow may look beautiful but it hides a multitude of sins check out this reading group guide http www readinggroupguides com gui and this interesting review from the telegraph with a very different opinion of the book http tinyurl com ajy7ofh","536":"all the way through this book i felt like i was waiting waiting for a crescendo that never arrived slow almost enigmatically so but not enough to make me stop reading unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations and i felt like i'd wasted valuable time on this book","537":"stop putting i remember every other paragraph i get it you're telling a story about your past","538":"a compelling read with an inevitable and depressing end","539":" i was a little disappointed by this book because i have such high expectations of man booker short listers the voice of the narrator was interesting when he was certain but when he faltered it came off as very pathetic i was intrigued by the glimpse into russian culture that this novel offered the tone was a little cynical and off putting at times the snowdrops are only mentioned at the beginning of the book and again at the end through most of the novel they are not mentioned the writer obviously realized that with that much time between the definition of a snowdrop and the discovery of one that the definition would need to be repeated which he graciously did","540":"this was a well written concise book with a great story line set in modern russia i loved the detail and sleaziness that the author portrayed in the surroundings and characters the main character was really interesting in that he portrayed a stereotypical commercial lawyer with delayed regard to the dodgy exploits going on all around him but also that in the end it wasn't really his conscious but his broken heart that affected him most original storyline and interesting read recommended","541":"great book a must read for all that have visited pre and post soviet moscow","542":"very impressive the kind of quiet thriller with a flawed protagonist at the center that graham greene used to do so well the evocation of post soviet moscow is amazing and gives the book the sort of you are there authenticity that gorky park and the charm school had view spoiler as i think about this book i keep trying to figure out whether i buy the main character and leaning toward not because ultimately he would have to be completely amoral to do what he did to go along with the scheme even after he figured out what was happening why would you let yourself be lied to stolen from and ultimately be part of a con that costs an inoffensive old woman everything it's like he was willing to give up everything decent about himself to be stay belong in moscow rather than return to the uk and what he clearly saw as a kind of living death basically the situation he's in when he's writing the letter but then why would he return to the uk at then end why not quit his job and stay on in moscow it's like paying the fare for travel but then not using the ticket his soul and decency are already forfeit so ultimately no not as good as a graham green novel because of internal contradictions in the character but it does a great job of evoking moscow hide spoiler","543":"loved this book and look forward to more from this author suspenseful great sense of something sinister in the background very good writing","544":"people like this book seriously i can't believe it i hate giving up on books but this book sucks described as noir type suspense mystery fiction please this book is so freaking boring and painful to read and filled with stereotypes of people from russia never been there but work with russians and even this was too much for me gave up 50 % through book why waste my limited free time reading this nonsense","545":"tight stylish thriller amid the ruthless russian underworld","546":" the most overrated novel i have ever read if the critics inserted in the inside of the books covers were in fact written by someone who actually knows what to search for in a book then i must say that the cultural honesty of those very institutions is now shunned by me what starts out as a focused and gripping novel soon develops into nothing not delivering the suspense killer facts the reader is waiting for since page one the ending is predictable and very shallow i must also make a reference to the marketing behind the novel from the cover to the title to the synopsis on the back snowdrops appears as a perfect reading for those who want a crime based novel set on moscow it is nothing like that snowdrops fails to deliver what it promises in its marketing surroudings it develops as nothing more than a cruddy romance between a main character that does nothing to engage the readers into liking him and a russian version of a burocratic femme fatale of which we know very little about a bad read overall and a terrible one if it was not a d miller's writing technique the one true thing that saved the novel","547":"an interesting look at russia","548":"set in moscow in the 1990s an english lawyer gets fleeced at every turn interesting plot and well written","549":" nick platt is a 40 something british lawyer specializing in corporate affairs who finally finds himself on the precipice of marriage there's just one problem nick feels the need to explain to his bride to be about his \"lost\" years a period of time spanning roughly four years in which he lived in russia and worked primarily in moscow bad idea nick bad bad bad credit the guy for wanting to be honest and wanting a fresh start free from lies and secrets with his new partner for life but seriously would a person really sit down and write a two hundred and eighty eighty page explanation in the form of a well constructed could possibly be nominated for a man booker award novel to anyone for anything it doesn't seem likely read more http www opinionless com book revie","550":"i was in the mood for a good mystery novel set in russia sochi 2014's fault and i couldn't have been more disappointed while i did get the russian flavour i was looking for everything else fell flat","551":" i read this because it had been longlisted for the booker prize for 2011 it is the story of nick an american lawyer and his four years working in moscow written in the form of a letter to someone he is in love with i think we're supposed to assume a fiancee it is the moscow of the 2000s when capitalism has taken hold the past has taught people not to ask questions and stay out of trouble and the culture has morphed into one where if you have enough cash you can buy anything you need nick sees the manifestations of this every day in his work where they assist in business deals that are clearly at least ethically borderline the book starts and ends with a dead body and in between involves a bunch of scam artists and frigid surroundings nick why are you so stupid why don't you do anything i'm not much on the story but i like the way it was told little memorable bits it somehow manages to be claustrophobic and lonely at the same time russia is like lariam you know that malaria medicine that can make you have wild dreams and jump out of the window you shouldn't do it if you're the kind of person who gets anxious or guilty because you'll crack when the end of the world comes it will come from russia when a relationship ends it isn't your lover that you learn about you learn about yourself","552":"picked this up randomly at the library and really enjoyed the whole setting in russia the look into the world there as told by the author a little bit of history and the mystery that was involved good read","553":"really enjoyed this good read although it reminded me why i have no particular desire to go back to russia","554":"if you'd like to read a russian novel written by an englishman you'd do better with gerhardie's futility","555":"slightly weak ending but the rest of the book was so good that it was forgivable","556":"having read half of the book i knew exactly how the story would end this is such a typical story but the book itself is brilliant this is probably the first book about russia written by a foreigner that accurately describes my country and its people","557":" snowdrops is the story of nick platt is a british lawyer who when traveling home one night on the train fights off a mugger the mugger's intended target masha and her younger sister katya became a central part of nick's life as masha and nick begin to become involved he is introduced to their aunt tatiana vladimirovna and finds himself obliged to help out in the sale of her apartment in general snowdrops is a substandard book there is a continual guarantee of action but then it never conveys it 2 stars","558":" a d miller spent three years in moscow as a foreign correspondent for the magazine the economist he puts his experience of the city to very good use in this novel set in the post soviet union society of the late 1990s snowdrops is a gripping and absorbing story of immorality naivete and corruption the story features 38 year old british lawyer nick platt and is narrated by him in the form of a confessional letter or note to his unnamed fiancee nick is an innocent abroad he works in corporate financial law he meets two attractive young russian women on the moscow metro system and as a result becomes embroiled in a low key property scam at work he is an unwitting party to a major commercial banking fraud in both instances he is unaware that he is being exploited until it is too late to do anything about it snowdrops is a beautifully written informative and intelligent novel about the moral vacuum that has seemingly been allowed to establish or reassert itself in the transition from communism to capitalism in modern day russia in the new market economy it appears that literally everything has some sort of price tag attached to it although private provision has largely replaced state subsidy it is still possible to arrange a contract killing to fast track one's way into a fashionable nightclub despite the long queue of people waiting patiently to obtain access to it and to circumvent official bureaucratic procedures but only if one has sufficient money to pay the asking price or knows someone who is in a position to bend the rules in one's favour capitalist moscow is portrayed as a breeding ground for con artists gangsters and prostitutes and anyone else on the make and it is seemingly all too easy to become accidentally involved in this culture of duplicity and greed the characterisation is excellent and the story itself is a rattling good yarn with that ever important quality of page turning readability i imagine that if they have not already done so hollywood film studios will soon be clamouring at the door of the author's agents to begin negotiations to buy the film rights to the book snowdrops is a compelling account of innocence and moral demise wrapped up in brilliantly descriptive and readable prose it is a novel that is well worth reading i loved it 9 10","559":"i've just been looking at the quotes on the back of the book the daily mail says that snowdrops 'reads like graham greene on steroids' i presume that this person hasn't read the book or doesn't know the effects of steroids snowdrops is a decent enough novel but it took me quite a while to read it i always seemed to be finding other things to do the portrayal of moscow as some sort of living entity which tries to gain possession of its narrator's mind and soul is the best thing about the book the russian characters are largely stereotypes reminding me of alan partridge's girlfriend all of the young women or poor quality actors playing kgb agents in terrible programmes like the professionals all the middle aged men or they are scary babooshkas talking in enigmatic aphorisms and pining for pre glasnost days miller frames the book in the form of a letter to a never seen fiancee _ i've no idea why we never get to 'meet' her or find out the purpose of the framing device the story for what it's worth involves a british lawyer falling for an out of his league russian girl and an elaborate plan to assist the young woman's grandmother in a property deal the reader gets the sense that there's something very dodgy going on very early in the book and in terms of being carried along with the story let's just say that it would make a rather glamorous edition of 'watchdog' miller creates a nice sense of melancholy and i was driven to persevere to the end by narrator nick's growing sense of inevitable doom the book acts as a useful moscow city guide miller was the economist's moscow correspondent and i enjoyed the author's insight into the way the city functioned in a very different manner to most western capital cities miller also proposes that russia is indeed a 'gangster state' and a very dangerous place for the innocent or unwary i'm not sure how the book made the 2011 booker shortlist miller's writing has an elegiac quality and i did enjoy reading it but as for the independent's assertion that snowdrops is electrifying it leaves you stunned and addicted well i'd beg to differ","560":" really enjoyed this book it's not a crime novel a thriller or a murder mystery it's a tale of slow gentle moral decline of the narrator beautifully written wonderfully set in modern russia full of corruption greed murder dirt and prostitutes it is written as a letter confession to his fiance reflective descriptive that author and the narrator are my age my stage of life i could relate to a lot of how the narrator felt about approaching middle age th story unfolds slowly and gently drawing you along so much so that i read it in about 2 days of commuting time and the ending was fantastic really nailed it such a hard thing for so many writers i'd love to see what this author writes next again a lot of errors that could have been caught by a half decent proofreader","561":" nearly always downbeat and sad but well written and in many places very funny interesting as a travelogue of early putin era moscow biggest issue that i have with this is that our narrator never once seems to question bad things that he knows are going on around him despite having all kinds of misgivings about peoples motives and histories framed as a story being told to a fiance it makes the future groom appear kind of stupid and amoral which the narrator admits is understandable we are supposed to believe that his love for a russian girl somehow convinced him to ignore all the warning signs but nowhere in the book does it provide more than a glancing foundation for this setup still i was entertained","562":"'snowdrops' is the debut novel from british writer a d miller nick platt is a british lawyer living and working in moscow russia the city is a hedonistic dream - nightclubs women and with enough money you can get anything you desire moscow is a playground for wealthy businessmen ex kgb and one lonely pommie ex pat one night nick meets and beds two beautiful russian women and falls in love with one of them 'masha' to her friends to help masha's aunt nick gets involved in the russian real estate business but nothing in this city is at it seems and everything comes with a price 'snowdrops' is the perfectly inconspicuous title for this psychological chiller 'snowdrops' refers to moscow slang a corpse that lies buried or hidden in the winter snows emerging only in the thaw it's a perfect title for this unassuming little book that has quite a bite to it miller has written in one of the most sophisticated but difficult literary traps - an unreliable narrator readers wade through nick's first person narrative with seeming trust - but pretty soon he slips up little details are missing or disturbingly swept under the rug and reader's slowly come to realize that nick's perspective is somewhat skewed when i got home that evening i found a smear of blood along the inside walls of my building running up the stairs at about waist heights outside one of the doors on the second floor the blood plummeted downwards as if the person leaning against the wall and leaking it had collapsed there underneath there was a little blood puddle and next to the puddle a pair of old black shoes standing neatly parallel to one another with their laces done up when i went downstairs in the morning the blood had been washed off the walls but the shoes were still there it was one of the alcoholics on the top floor someone told me later he fell it was nothing to worry about they told me it took a little while for me to realize that nick wasn't the most reliable of narrators and quite frankly in a novel of many twists and turns nick's unreliability was one of the biggest and best miller is right up there with f scott fitzgerald and alfred hitchcock for his perfectly pitched unreliable narration brilliant 'snowdrops' is a psychological thriller you have to go through the novel separating the wheat from the chaff - truth from fiction and cover up and it's ever harder to do when the backdrop is moscow i have never been to russia myself but miller evokes a time and place that seems outlandishly real russia as a city torn down by history and the decline of the ussr a place of double dealings and shady corners at once eerily beautiful and unremorsefully seedy it's all encapsulated in that one metaphor for snow and 'snowdrops' - something of purity that blankets a place and makes it look pristine for a little while until the thaw comes to reveal the bodies underneath chilling and apt where russia is concerned a d miller's debut novel won't be for everyone - he's writing is stark and unremorsefully tangled - he's writing unreliably and beautifully","563":"had high expectations for this book it didn't reach them an enjoyable enough read but doubt i'll remember much about it in a month","564":"not bad but no plot development in the end not much has changed good picture of leningrad in the 90s","565":"there were parts of this book that i liked others i wasn't convinced of it wasn't helped by the fact i did not like the main character nick even my love of books based in russia did not help improve my opinion it was well written it had a lot to commend it i guess i just didn't enjoy the storyline that much possibly because it's broken my fantasy of russia from historical russian literature","566":" i enjoyed this book to a certain extent i loved the prose style some of the lines are just beautiful miller creates a fantastically foreboding atmosphere as we watch nick's morals slowly ebb away as he loses himself in russia and in the woman he falls for there the climax when it comes is rather underwhelming but perhaps this was the point however i just felt there maybe could have been a tiny bit more of a payoff for the reader in general however i enjoyed this rather short book recommend","567":"the setting for this novel is russia gloomy dark and covered in snow the tone is menacing with a heady mix of corruption which begins with our protagonist nicholas an english lawyer and a chance meeting with two 'predatory' women this encounter sets in motion shady dealings with nicholas slowly losing his grip on morality told as a confession to his future bride to be and as a means of gaining some insight into his amoral behaviour this is a fine debut and i was gripped from beginning to end very wry witty and written in an engaging style recently longlisted for the man booker and deservedly so","568":"found by chance in a hotel bookshelf and read in one afternoon enjoyed the background colour of life in moscow the story is well developed although towards the end i found it less convincing","569":" snowdrops is a beautifully executed book the point of view is a man telling his soon to be wife about his time in moscow from the beginning we know a dead body shows up by the end of the book the title itself is slang for those bodies that lie frozen all winter until the snow and ice thaws a d miller does not rest on that fact however throughout the book there is a steadily built sense of doom despair and denial that i am happy to say paid off in the end not in a dramatic way rather in a way that made the pit of my stomach ache a melancholy way having not read the other nominees on the man booker shortlist i cannot say for certain if this should win but i can definitely see why it is on the list","570":"i'm absolutely floored beyond words i love love love this book to death the lyrical prose and its surreptitiously devastating aura are simultaneously noxious and edifying the book to beat for 2011 hope it gets more accolades than the booker because it deserves so much more","571":"gripping with an interesting setting a little predictable though and this is from someone who never works out the ending to anything","572":"i chose this book because i dont know much about russia well except for this http punditkitchen files wordpress so i chose this book to explore a part of the world i havent read much about it didnt really teach me anything about it either a d miller is a good enough writer with an extensive knowledge of russia read his bio but i didnt understand the point of the book i couldnt connect with the story","573":"a quick read enjoyed the descriptions of moscow in winter couldn't stand the protagonist too weak willed","574":"what a depressing book now i am going to read crime and punishment to try and regain my bearings snowdrops documents the moral decay of russian society no fun","575":" this book takes you into the experience of living in moskov and other parts of russia the author portrays very well the country the cold of the russian winter the people who lived through through the war the citizens living there today andof the foreigners living there threaded through these discriptions the author tells the story of a london lawyer involved with a russian girl and the mystery behind their relationship i found myself at times wanting the author to get on with it and to shorten the story i finished the book with having gotten some insight of modern day russia but also with a feeling of relief for finally finishing the book in would have been a better read if it was pared down quite a bit","576":"i think this novel has put me off visiting moscow any time soon a very bang up to the minute story of corruption in russia horribly readable","577":"sad suspenseful tale of an unethical western dolt in moscow","578":"i simply could not get along with this book the plot was simplistic and the denouement painfully obvious for a very early stage while the representation of russia and of moscow in particular was almost offensively stereotypical the characters were also very one dimensional i couldn't summon up an ounce of sympathy for any of them not even those who were sinned against cannot fathom why this was short listed for the man booker","579":"the title refers to frozen corpses unearthed at the spring thaw nicholas is working as a corporate lawyer for an english company in moscow and is drawn by two beautiful and mysterious young women into situation he knows to be horribly morally wrong and criminal yet cannot walk away from it even though he knows the girl he is sleeping with and her friend are mercenary don't expect a lot of thrills and action in this book it's a slow simmer to the end but very atmospheric and evocative of what sounds like a truely unpleasant corruption riven money grabbing capitalist gangster state","580":"this really doesn't paint modern russia in a very good light it is chilling how materialistic cold and ruthless the people portrayed in this story are","581":"not a bad read just one to read on holiday light fiction","582":"the author evokes a contemporary russia that rings true for anyone who follows the news that emerges from that country it is a place where the corruption is both corporate and individual and human lives get crushed with little regard this novel has been long listed for the man booker prize and is deserving of that distinction","583":"it kept me entertained but in the end it turned out to be a little dull gorky park or child 44 are better if you like this sort of thing","584":"elegantly structured multi tiered tale of love and betrayal haunting","585":"'i smelled it before i saw it' this is the opening line and apart from his odd use of the word 'smelled' instead of the more usual 'smelt' which grated on me a little it is a great way to begin this novel which is all about not only the smell that rises off this newly uncovered and at the beginning of the novel unknown corpse but also the gradual rise of the stench of corruption not just from the government officialdom and thugs of 21st century moscow but also the way our narrator nick an english lawyer finds himself steeped in its filth and stink but unable unwilling to detach himself from it the story is told not exactly in flashback but as a sort of confession to his unnamed fiancee he is preparing to marry at some point and presumably though it is never made clear his conscience or what remains of it has driven him to need to speak of what happened in the last eight months of his time in moscow three storylines weave in and out of each other his professional 'lawyer ing' including that carried out for a dubious cossack oil magnate his half hearted attempts to help his elderly neighbour who is worried about the disappearance of one of his old friends from the flat opposite and the third the main story nick's love infatuation addiction for a young russian woman masha and how she cajoles bribes seduces him into helping her move her elderly aunt from a prized property in central moscow to a new build on the outskirts this sounds perhaps drab and boring when set down cold on the page but it is a work of extraordinary power you feel the dirt and depravity begin to drag you down as you read nick is a coward a failure and not to make too fine a point of it a slimeball to be fair he does not really try to justify himself his attempts to be honest to his fiancee and us his readers his continual facing up to his failures and his recognition that deep down he knew for a long time what he was involving himself in is a slightly redeeming feature right from the start of his account masha and her sister appear in the first few pages he always punctuates everything with a down at heel commentary like a whipped dog cowering in a corner in disgrace the story is one of betrayal cruelty and unbelievable callousness we know this almost from the start like that damoclean sword it hangs you know it must fall but you don't know why or how or to whom that is part of the power of this book as a reader you are inside his infatuation but miller brilliantly in my opinion keeps you detached enough to look on in horror as you begin to realize what has been done so the story is a sobering one the plot not intricate but gripping all the same the characters are not well drawn but that is the point we see everything through the eyes sometimes justifying sometimes guilt ridden of nick miller has a great turn of phrase and there is real humour in some of his analogies but it is interesting and presumably purposeful that these humourous images are always bleak and even they disappear and move out of sight totally as the story goes deeper speaking of a georgian taxi driver who had two religious icons in his cab ' made me feel safer and more vulnerable at the same time less likely to have my throat cut but also that my life might be in the hands of someone who thought looking in the mirror or braking were god's worries rather than his ' 'it was the kind of moscow weather that makes you want the sky to just get on with it like a condemned prisoner looking up at the blade of the guillotine' 'he hd one of those senses of humour that are really a kind of warfare laughing at his jokes made you feel guilty not laughing at them makes you feel endangered ' 'the city authorities had pulled the flowers out of their beds as they do every year when the game is up carting them away in the night like condemned prisoners so they don't die in public' 'the confused november sky reminded me of a black and white television set that hadn't been tuned in ' every now and again nick's adoration of masha moves you to see his preparedness to behave as he did was almost unavoidable because of this adoration'the fine blond hairs on the knots of her spine glowed in the moonlight from the window like a love letter written on her body in invisible ink' i can almost forgive him being a bastard when you see that almost innocent gaze but then miller's underlying theme never really goes very far away'the snow let you forget the scars and blemishes like temporary amnesia for a bad conscience' there is one coincidence from my reading future i have just put camus' 'l'etranger' to read again on my bedside and one incident i remember clearly from my reading of it before was meursault's watching the old woman sitting and painstakingly mark off in pen the programmes she plans to watch on tv that coming week nick whilst visiting his parents back in england comes across'the television guide in which she'd his mother put tragic asterisks next to the programmes she wanted to watch'it struck me as interesting that meursault i seem to remember had no response other than a noticing of the woman's meticulousness nick in his own growing sense of being caught up in an exciting situation back in russia sees tragedy loss and hopelessness in his mother's action her sad predictability is the thing he will at all costs seek to escape it is this fear of mediocrity which drove him from london in the first place and pushes him on to do anything to keep his 'trophy girl' towards the end we get a paragraph of some wisdomnick is in love with the idea and excitement and possibilities of russian escape as much as he is with masha when things fall what lessons are learned 'it isn't your lover that you learn about you learn about yourself' the snowdrop is the lovely flower heralding the end of winter or it is the decaying corpse coming into view as the disguising snow disappears and reveals what was hidden for the reader there are many corpses decaying there is much lying hidden and miller makes you think that horribly unthinkable thought'if i was infatuated and swept up in love how far would i let myself be swept ' powerful well worth the read","586":"i loved the slow realization that dawns on the english lawyer that he has allowed himself to go along with something for the sake of a tainted love snowdrops is skillfully written drawing the reader in with the same dawning understanding that comes to nicholas highly recommended","587":"not a thriller but an elegant and personal story with nick the lawyer allowing himself be played reminds a bit of isherwood greene and someone else i cannot quite recall","588":"this was a well written contemporary tale set in moscow the aruthors sense of humor is sharp and his observations of russian society and character astute","589":"3 5 stars i loved the details on russia the insight into their morals attitudes and beliefs but the weakness of the main character irritated me","590":"there are not many books out there that i give 5 stars to but this book is worth every star and more i bought this novel after hearing a d miller talking at the edinburgh international book festival the passage he read out during his reading hooked me and i knew i needed to get my hands on a copy of the novel in no way is this a fast paced thriller but it had me hooked from the very start and i was surprised that i found myself reading this book in one sitting i found the pace of the novel slow but it was the writing of the novel that hooked me and that was the biggest surprise to me a d miller brings to life a modern day moscow that i could see vividly in my mind i felt like i was standing beside the characters seeing the story unfold in front of my eyes i thought this was an excellent debut novel and i look forward to reading what this author comes up with next i agree with many bloggers out there that are saying that snowdrops does not read as a man booker prize winner however i think that the writing is so beautiful that this could be the wildcard and surprise everyone by taking the prize this review was first published on http everybookhasasoul wordpress com","591":"loved reading and getting a feel for moscow however didn't like the main character thought he was weak why go into all that detail about his relationship when telling the story to his intended marriage partner","592":"in the end it seemed a little bit cursory or seen from the outside as if the author's experiences hadn't quite been properly turned into fiction i can see why it ended up on the booker longlist because although it reads like a thriller it's really not one also you honestly can't believe that the protagonist could be quite such a doufus no matter how much in love he thought he was so in the end ultimately a bit disappointing he should write about something that isn't all surface flare and journalistic look at this to him from the bits of the book that were about the narrator's actual feelings and relationships i think that could be good","593":"this was the most sexist book i have ever read i wouldn't have finished it except that i was mad at myself for wasting $8 on buying it the main character is an ass and gets taken it was a bore yawn","594":"some seriously intriguing stuff it left me rather bitter about russian culture as a whole but it's certainly a well written book worthy of it's booker nomination","595":"modern russia amoral place where theives abound disturbing book which ties together at the very end set in moscow if this is capitalism they should have remained communist","596":"cliched and disappointing this novel is populated by caricatures drawn straight from every dodgy spy story ever written add to that a poorly placed plot in which little happens and even less that isn't entirely predictable and an ending that is deeply underwhelming mix all this in with some comedy russian 'voices' and you've got snowdrops this was the final book i read from 2011's booker list and sums up the quality of the majority never again","597":"very very enjoyable and a quick read","598":"very readable serviceable crime novel with a convincingly bleak depiction of modern moscow probably means more to the reader who knows the setting and russian a few of the translations jarred ie slushaiu literally means 'i'm listening' but not in the context of a cafe owner asking for a customer's order am not sure it deserved its place on the booker shortlist","599":"this book was disappointing to me the novel offered nothing new regarding russian culture or people and only perpetuated the same old image of a corrupt russia i raced through the end of the novel just to have it done with an interesting aspect to the novel was that the protagonist was looking back on his experiences in russia and identified key moments where he could have changed how things turned out in two key situations he was wittingly blind to what was going on around him the present day protagonist was still working to process the sense of responsibility he felt as a result of these decisions here is a link to my blog and full review on the novel","600":"of sentimental significance because it was the last recommendation from my father and i read it after he died a bloke's tale perhaps a little obvious","601":"i can't believe it was shortlisted for a booker to me there was nothing noteworthy about the writing at all for anyone who's ever known modern young russian women you'll know he did a bang up job describing them and what things have become but that's about it the story was predictable and the writing was mediocre","602":"not the type of book i usually read but really enjoyed it","603":"i thought it was a good view into the mess that russia is quick and easy read that gives a feeling for both time and place","604":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i suppose i am a russophile to some extent fascinated in how russia is moving from communism to its present form of government the book is about a lawyer in moscow making deals that turn out to be scams as well as getting involved in a scam on a personal level","605":"on hold cannot get into this nit sure where it's going will try again at some point","606":" when i first picked up snowdrops i was a bit disappointed in it the writing seemed amateurish in its overuse of adjectives and qualifiers and i wasn't sure the plot would be gripping enough to carry me through but i stuck with it and soon found several levels of miller's writing to appreciate first off miller slowly reveals the novel as a story in a story our protagonist nick is narrating the whole thing to his fiancee which means there's plenty to read between the lines and a whole new plotline subtly hinted at throughout the text secondly miller does a beautiful job describing russia excessive adjective use quickly fades and the descriptions of nick's surroundings and life in moscow become vivid and strangely haunting finally the story is fast paced and offers plenty of double dealing and psychological disintegration so the pages fly by it's a bit of a dark depressing read but snowdrops will definitely keep you thinking of an afternoon","607":" surprisingly a quick read this is a book i had to read for my bookclub and was not sure i would like it but i did the one person narrative leaves you wondering what the other characters think and feel but i guess that is the point of this book i am going to st petersburg this summer and the main character's visit to that town was particularly interesting to me the book also painted a very good picture of the illegal activities in russia and the collective struggle of a nation in the process to be reborn","608":"rubbish got to page 65 and gave up boring badly written with an arrogant author and unlikeable protagonist even the framing was terrible the idea that someone would sit down to write their wife to be a confessional letter about a time many years ago that she's been mildly curious about is unbelievable and then to fill said letter with details about his steamy sexual relationship with a woman he thought he loved is mad why the hell would you do that to someone you intend to marry i can predict the inevitable plot line which is said slapper he meets in moscow fucks him in order to exhort money the end how this managed to get shortlisted for the man booker prize i will never know","609":"a scarcely credible plot and poor grammar","610":" on the first page snowdrop is defined as moscow slang for a corpse that lies buried or hidden in the winter snows emerging only in the thaw thus begins the journey of nicholas platt a mild mannered englishmen pushing on middle age thrust into the deep seeded corruption of post soviet moscow lonely and more then a tinge desperate for female attention nicholas finds himself a willing pawn in murky plot the book is completely engrossing and the description of moscow seems to thoroughly capture the pervasive seediness of the place a d miller worked for the economist as the moscow correspondent so you get the feeling that he knows what he's talking about a total page turner","611":" i was thoroughly fascinated by this book i still can't figure out why i liked it so much since the pace of the story was slow for me but the writing is so perfectly beautiful that it will mesmerize you the story it written as a letter from an english lawyer named nicholas to his fiance revealing an indiscretion that even he can't truly explain except to say that he was used by a woman that had bewitched him masha sails into nicholas' life and convinces him to help complete the sale of some property for an older woman the tale twists and turns between russian mafia unethical business men and the women who will steal more than just your credit card after a sexual romp nick seems to be so intelligent and so fact conscious that it at first seems improbable that he could be used in a scam where masha and katya possibly cousins respond to his loneliness with taking him under their wing in order to help them illegally sell property that is owned by their aunt he explains to his girlfriend that he should have seen the scam coming but couldn't believe that someone might actually take advantage of him i found it very interesting to read the descriptions of corruption in russia and how business is actually conducted i don't know who to compare this story to since i don't think i have ever read anything like it before","612":"interesting travelogue of moscow unreliable narrator not really a thriller more like a memoir recommended","613":"couldn't put it down loved it","614":"written in the past tense as a letter to his current fiancee nick tells the story of a period of his time spent in russia beginning with how he met masha i thought the plot was a bit weak not a lot seemed to happen except revelations at the end i did enjoy a the descriptions of russia and miller's dry understated sense of humour","615":"a toss up between 3 stars and 4 a quick read","616":"thriller mystery crime um noabsolutely nothing happens in this bookit's not badly written but boring so maybe that's even worse if you're looking for some suspense pick a different book","617":"a dull book undeserving of its hype between the casual racism dull narrator and a promise of a crime story that singularly fails to start let alone deliver there is much to be dissatisfied with this book at best this is a tale of russo centric orientalism an attempt to show the otherness of russia compared to the civilised face of london and the west it's man booker nomination is undeserved","618":"a beautifully written tour of the sinister modern russia i love to imagine the last fifty pages' creeping dread are hard to take but necessarily so really good","619":" snowdrops by a d miller i was reading this book in stages between traveling back from south australia i arrived home and still had half to go i decided to start reading it again as i just could not get a feel for it other than yuk horrible characters and nasty russia actually the first one third of the book i have read three times now the more i reread the words the more the writing made sense and i fell into the greyness that the style evokes i think one word describes this from my point of view noir nwahr } the french word for black mostly used in film but this really depicts this book for me it is tough different dialogue and in the style of contemporary pulp fiction the characters of film noir speak their minds in a blunt way nick telling his russian story to his bland faceless fiancee and all of his conversations with masha were like this i really believe miller could have found a better vehicle to channel the story than a ridiculous letter to his faceless fiance but he didn't was this possibly another black and hilarious angle to deliver his words to us i must admit i did wonder if the writing style was deliberate or not was this a really bad writer that landed onto a style that appears clever enough to become an entrant for the booker price the language that miller uses seemed jumbled and the sentences too long on my first reading the characters nick the 38 year old turning 20 that has no appreciation for his parents and way too much love for the masha the hard as nails long legged deep throated love siren of 23 going on 40 on my first reading i had little interest in any of the character except the unlucky aunt and nicks elderly next door neighbour i found nick so repulsive in his sickly nothing personality that i just wanted to scribble him out of the story with a big think black pen what i did like from the very beginning was the way miller walked and talked you through his russia so much information so simply told as i read millers words a second time they started to flow for me the third reading of the first third of the book saw me getting a much greater appreciation of all millers choice of characters even nick i believe there are a lot of expat nicks out there off to another country to improve their chances of looking normal or even exotic i started to see nick just as he was basic no personality and even less energy miller obviously had seen and known men like this and he had seen all the other characters and found a way to retell the well worn theme of russia and the bad guys the cold and the drink in a different way to give it a new feel and style for his reader nick was ripe for the picking and the young woman recognised this you just knew as you read the part where the sisters pick nick up that something is a foot on the first read i had no idea how this book could be considered for a major literary prize but i remember reading some booker prize contenders and winners that have raised my eye brows as well second appraisal saw me appreciating the simple style that miller wrote snowdrops in giving the old russian spy and dagger death and beauty theme a different slant and maybe truer read i didn't love the book but i got to appreciate and actually enjoy the rereading of it i appreciated the characters so much more they fitted into the scenery and the greyness and dirtiness also the old beauty of russia and allowing the reader to feel the whole book to be able to ease yourself into the russia and the characters and the story miller was weaving for us at times my feet were frozen and i could smell the decay and glimpsed the trash and filth peaking through the thin layers of white clean snow","620":"a convincing tale of lust and deception in modern russia","621":"this book was slow a book about mistakes that i did t really understand at first but very deep in the end it wasn t a long book and still i had a hard time getting to the part where i couldn t leave it out of my hand in this book the story teller talks about his life in russia of the '90s it s a hallucinating life where the weak are pray for the strong and where the people are as cold as the almost never ending winter","622":"i mostly enjoyed this book it was an interesting dip into post soviet russia with all its corruption and a good portrayal of what such a corrupt society does to people winners and losers sometimes it was unsatisfactory but not sure why","623":"wonderful depiction of modern moscow but in light of all the great reviews i expected a lot and was ultimately disappointed","624":" this review was originally posted on my blog i picked up this book because i wondered what exactly had warranted its nomination for the man booker prize the novel is written from a first person perspective from the start the reader knows that someone has been discovered dead having just surfaced as a snowdrop thus the suspense kicks in immediately and you wonder who this dead person is and why nick is so reluctant yet persistent in his efforts to confess something from his past to his future wife it is evident that something bad has happened in the time that he was working as a lawyer in moscow but the scale of it is only revealed much later in fact the first half of the book i found a bit slow going and depressing nick admits to leaving london behind in order to escape the fact that his twenties were now over he describes the following years as being all about marriages breaking apart losing elderly parents and adopting cats not the most cheerful view on life as a thirty something is it it is a pity that moscow is not really an improvement in lifestyle or outlook nick's social network consists of his co workers and cynical journalist steve the value of these acquaintances is made perfectly clear by the following comment steve exploits nick for leads and in turn nick exploits him for conversation in english that wasn't about bonuses besides they all tend to meet up at tacky overpriced restaurants and stripclubs not places i'd imagine myself hanging out in my spare time nick does make an effort to go and sightsee moscow and leningrad when his estranged mother comes to visit unfortunately everything from the hermitage to the red square gives off a dilapidated and desolate impression as for his complicated love life masha is a shady character who fits the stereotype of a young long legged scantily dressed and business like russian woman i apologise for indadvertedly insulting anyone but that is the image i have of her and partner in crime katya against better judgment and small pangs of unease nick keeps on dating her in case she is the one cracks start to appear in his carefully maintained illusion when things start to not add up in both his corporate and his private life how to define love when a meeting with a parent is silently acknowledged as a favour that needs to be returned and can the cossack really be trusted the implicating web of deception that ties nick tighter by the minute is shrewdly spun aftwards he realises how ruthless the perpetrators had to be how utterly without scruples in order to bring their scam s to a fruitful conclusion this is a sobering tale about a country and city unfamiliar to me i was surprised by the all pervading corruption and how easily the moscovians shrug this off as being a natural order of things miller realistically portrays a city jaded by crookedness and it is not a place i would like to visit any time soon","625":"pretty good a story set in modern day russia about trust love and real estate it's very involving but extremely laid back with a conclusion that kinda fizzles instead of pops it all works though recommended","626":" in this booker short list nominee a not so young british lawyer stationed in moscow learns the hard way about the russian way of doing business as he is taken advantage of both on the professional and personal levels the inefficiencies and corruption that seem to permeate contemporary russian society don't seem to damper nicholas's infatuation with moscow and the young girl he meets in a metro station and he finds himself getting deeply involved in several shady deals that we know will not turn out well recommended","627":"if i hadn't been to moscow recently i probably would have rated this lower would not be inclined to recommend this to others","628":"readable two dimensional prose good evocations of russia from a grimy sleazy viewpoint plot engaging but never really involving passes the time but doesn't settle in the heart nevertheless i read it to the end","629":"wasn't a 'wow ' book but i enjoyed it like a previous reviewer i wanted to shake nick but he made a conscious decision in the end is more fool him","630":"this would have been my man booker winner and it certainly cancels out the argument of whether you can be 'readable' and 'literary' at the same time it's a psychological thriller which has depth and intrigue narrated by the dupe of a crime and the spurned lover of a relationship the 'snowdrops' of the title refer to stalin's murder victims whose bodies were revealed as the snows started to melt in the spring but it's also a metaphor for what is revealed about us when love begins to thaw and when we see others and ourselves as we really are effortless beautiful funny and unputdownable","631":"this book has been sitting in my pile of must reads for a while now it was on my list because i wanted to read a thriller where weather is used to create the tension and atmosphere in the novel like lee child's echo burning which i absolutely loved i expected great things from snowdrops because of the hype it was shortlisted for the man booker prize and the cwa gold dagger in 2011 after finishing it i definitely feel that the things that were left unsaid are actually what make the story so completely gripping and disturbing it's a real eye opener into russia and the corruption and the geographical references and description enhance the plot as it unfolds i found the worldly confidence of the main character carried an unnerving wave of hopelessness i wouldn't want to live the life he was living every day his conscience eroding away the less you know the better to quote the book but that's what gave the story its unhinged edge it was a bit of a shock after reading chick lit and i still can't decide whether it's a keeper i will have to ponder that for a little while in terms of learning from the writer's style the lesson i picked up here was don't try to include everything leave some mystery and reading between the lines for your audience","632":"this was my choice for the book club and it really was not good","633":"bought it as it came well reviewed a page turner which gave areal feel to modern russia","634":" this was a strangely compelling book despite being rather bleak and despairing set in moscow the story takes us through about a year in the life of a british lawyer trying to live the ex pat lifestyle nick is a frustrating character for his apparent gullibility and apathy for the resulting predicaments in which he finds himself his russian girlfriend masha and her sister katya are both shady characters who he meets by chance on the metro but despite masha's sullen coldness he confesses to missing her once back in england at the end of the book cleverly but simply written no idea what the three reviewers on the cover were reading when they called it 'complex' the ice of the russian winter got into my bones even if the characters were sometimes rather thinly portrayed","635":"brilliantly written by an an author obviously well versed in the life of an expat in moscow at times it felt like it was a true account of something that had happened to him full of drama and suspense and alarmingly believable at how easy it seemed to fall into the local criminal ways without checking yourself","636":"impossible to put down moves at the speed of a runaway train moscow the girls winter nights the clubs and an improbable plot whose resolution you never see coming totally gripping electrifying and believable","637":"the book gals for may 2012","638":" wow good thing i paid less than a dollar for this book i would have kicked myself in the nuts if i paid anything over two bucks for this piece of boring fiction this was a big load of donkey crap with a side of even more crap this is not much of story book but more of a tourist guide of moscow the author apparently lived there while doing some journalistic work so he is very familiar with a lot of places and customs that are popular throughout russia you'll get a lot of talk of various places and multiple cultural norms that the character had to adopt to after moving there from london since the book is written as one long letter telling another person nick's fiancee how life in russia is the author constantly compares life in russia to life in london to help out the person who is reading this letter the character are as bland as they come nick is not very likable and comes off as more of a person in his late 20s due to his personality than a guy who is actually 38 masha is pretty much the same she is 24 and apparently in love with nick russia's age difference issue is not as big as it would be here in the us she comes off as very boring yet good looking which makes me think nick obsessed over her than was \"in love\" with her she takes him around to various places with her sister who is not even that as we find later on and introduces him to few people including her aunt who guess what needs nick's help since he is some sort of a lawyer or some shit since nick is gullible apparently he is the only one that does not see this \"relationship\" he has with masha as anything but real despite the girlfriends he had in the past that only wanted his money and despite the warnings from his friends that russian girls want a guy for money on a lot of occasions in the end she even manages to take a lot more from him still nick claims he is in love i mean come on she dresses like a prostitute for most of the time and all she has is beauty and nothing else she is basically an empty shell with a nice paint job the setting is good the author has a vast knowledge of moscow there was a lot of description on how people are drunk rough looking poor etc as well as many places that were for the most part buried under layers of snow giving it a false appearance of a wonderland the character also dwells a lot into corruption that plagues russia and the constant asking for bribes by the government officialsin conclusion narrative was ok a lot of ____ he said in english or ____he said in russian transitions characters are very one dimensional and i did not care much about them especially nick and his \"love\" masha the setting is good and for the most part well written and the story is so booooorring i was waiting for something to happen besides nick talking about some boring deals political crap at work and masha taking nick to see her aunt but nothing did i don't recommend this again i am glad i did not pay full price for this crap it was a small impulse buy based n cover art and i also don't know how this crap was shortlisted for 2011 booker award from this day on i am not trusting any book that says \"winner of _____year award \" the ending is so predictable i saw it coming about a third way into the book if not before p s the snowdrops are a type of white flower or in a moscow fashion people who are frozen in snow and thawed out as sun makes its appearance usually prostitutes and homeless people but also crooks in many occasions as russia is full of them","639":"found it a fascinating read although you could always see where the story was going it was interesting to read a novel with russia as the backdrop","640":"if i could give 2 5 stars then i would two stars seems a tad harsh but 3 seems overly generous it took a while before it really got going but even when it did i didn't feel captured by it","641":"nick was silly to do the things he did yet it was a novel that made me think masha are you crazy and sometimes i would hate on katya it was a weird novel but a good chilly twist that i liked","642":"honestly i'm wondering what all the fuss was about it gave me quite a miserable view of modern russia is it really that bad why are all the women in it badly dressed hookers or babushka don't believe the hype","643":" i have worked in moscow for a number of years and have to say was astonished at how well observed the 'just pre lehman moscow' was in some ways this is not surprising as the author lived there for some time as well but his telling commentary on the details of everyday life bring the time and place into sharp focus i agree with others that this portrayal of moscow darkened to suit the story is perhaps the starring part of the novel the young lawyer at the centre of the story working at a thinly disguised linklaters is slowly drawn into deception in his professional life and in his personal one this extends into self deception as he cannot confront the new beautiful russian girl in his life and risk loosing her a sense of impending but compelling doom never leaves the narrative the only part of the novel that did not work for me was the larger transaction our hero works on at his law firm even in moscow i cannot see this panning out in quiet this way the book is written in a compelling way and is certainly not overly long so i completed it quickly that is not to say it is too short it tells its tale and we have enough time to come to understand the duality that our narrator has for moscow repelled by the corruption but drawn to its primal energy a powerful compelling debut with a stunning sense of its setting","644":"eye opening look into post communist russia feels about hollow and empty like the main character clearly the other as drawn on his experiences in russia as a journalist letting us see a world we may not otherwise be privy too the protagonist is an innocent and dupe which seems a bit unrealistic but nevertheless it is worth reading","645":" a d miller used to work in russia i know this because his character nicholas can't stop telling me about being an englishman in russia but not in an interesting way in a really dull and patronising way it grated almost immediately as for the book itself it's less than ok slightly below average the set up that brings the characters together is stupid and it just carries on from there how did they pick him out how did they know he was such a drip and therefore an easy target nick is the kind of boorish person you'd have to listen to at the table behind if you made the terrible error of heading into a gastropub in north london all his friends would be gathered round ignoring their medicated children destroying the place while he holds court on the russian soul and their air of melancholy now that he's back from his year long working jolly meanwhile his wallet and phone would be gone because he's just so oblivious to everything other than himself the rest of the characters are one dimensional caricatures the cossack anyone and we really don't learn anything new about the dark side of russia it's been pretty well documented in recent years and while i'm not arguing that snowdrops needs to be unique it's too bland to stand out from the non fictional accounts which are far more interesting the only plus point for me was the story's resolution i did actually find that fairly chilling and quite well done it's just a shame about the rest of it","646":" knowing that this first time author was a journalist by trade did not help matters when i started reading this book the story was easy to get into but i had recurring visions of show vs tell written in red ink across this author's drafts nothing was left to the imagination as facts and observations were handed to me quite easily granted i just came from a book with a completely different and non traditional style and prose so perhaps i was a being a bit harsh as i went on however i realized that this simple style works although you won't get deep into the characters or a portrait of russian society if you're looking for this read city of thieves this matter of fact storytelling coincides with the story's reliance on the protagonist's naivety towards belonging loving living of wanting something more when deep down you know you know better but you refuse to be honest with yourself you're served notice throughout that the story will turn upside down and it's an essential element not just a forshadowing technique instead of a dramatic twist or turn of events being the sole hook and surprise there's the anticipation of how it will happen not if it will happen this is worth a read and probably better than 3 stars but there's so much potential here i was left longing for a darker narrative and experience and less the easy read the emotions that this character has to go through and experience are in real life so much more dramatic at least they are for me when i live through them","647":"the atmosphere in this book was phenomenally depressing but was very gripping","648":" a light and easy read for a booker short listed book but very enjoyable while the setting is intriguing and unsettling to say the least as the narrator contends with living and doing business in 80's 90's moscow for me the most enjoyable part was the unfolding of a series of events which the narrator may or may not be purposefully blind to for the sake of his hedonistic life in moscow being sucked into the unconstrained pleasures of the latter and not particularly trying to remove yourself from it even though things are not quite as they seem it the real key to the enjoyment of this novel","649":" snowdrop 1 an early flowering bulbous plant having a white pendent flower 2 moscow slang a corpse that lies buried in the winter snows emerging only in the thaw i had to put the quote - definition - at the start of this review as i've finally come across a shocker on the 2011 booker prize long list that quote above is before the novel starts and is probably the only redeeming snippet of this whole dog's breakfast story goes something like this a poor self absorbed narcissist lawyer decides to write a story for his soon to be bride about the time he spent in russia where he met a girl and her sister a dodgy oil merchant or some such called \"the cossack\" and he gets conned that's about it for a full review visit my blog at www messybooker blogspot com","650":"this is well written tense droll and probably everything you want from a book of the genre its well paced and the characters develop nicely its attitude to ethics in post soviet russia and the backdrop for the book is quite well thought out it is however let down by a slightly underwhelming ending essentially the purpose of the book and in some ways predictable tone a good not great book","651":"enjoyable although predictable quick read i find the seediness of russian life as the author describes it very creepy","652":"it's alright it did feel a little stereotypical in its descriptions but i've never been to russia quite a depressing tale","653":"a bravura whack of bright wicked prose painting a picture of moscow as a city of sharks and the poor wretches who are their food and how your desire for love makes you lose your sensibility and your soul beautiful descriptions of flashy nightclubs full of gangsters each one with his sheen of violence a sense of all order gone save the rule of having enough roof to protect you and to ensure your well being poor russia what a place to be born into","654":"i liked it although it was a little predictable at the end the descriptions of moscow russia were very evocative though probably the best bit of the book","655":"the way it starts and stops it would echo in your mind several days","656":"snow drops is set in moscow and is the chilling tale of the corruption that has evolved in modern russia and that is accepted as a way of life i have been to moscow and our guide alluded to the scams perpetrated against those fortunate enough to have earned the rights to a property with the end of communism snow drops tells the tale of nicholas a british ex pat lawyer working in moscow he meets masha a russian beauty who has moved to moscow with her sister to try to build a life nothing is what is seems and nicholas gets caught up in the web of intrigue and deception that masha is spinning around an elderly woman tatiana whom she has befriended nicholas believes the girls and tatiana are close relatives snow drops is a page turner as the reader gets sucked into masha's web of lies","657":"didn't like this book got it for christmas as i've seen it everywhere and thought that bcasue its everywhere then maybe it is a good book to read but it really isnt i don't appreciate the style its written in and it didnt really go anywhere and the end was soo predictable not really my cup of tea but gave good information about russia","658":"fine insight into modern russian life and lawlessness i like books that make me feel like i've been there would recognize a street or a weather pattern when i finally visit","659":" this book is written as a confession of a man to his fiancee which as a literary device doesn't work at all the protagonist is a middle aged man who spent four years in moscow where he fell in love with a young woman and became embroiled in all kinds of sordid goings on the love affair itself is not very convincing as the woman is not well described apart from tedious attention paid to the perkiness of her tits and the brilliance of her white patent leather boots moscow however is described in more satisfyingly gory and glorious detail the books zips and races along and the plot despite its weaknesses is engaging but it builds and builds and builds to nothing this was a disappointing book","660":"highly atmospheric but possibly slightly pointless possibly like moscow in the 1990s","661":"dear mr millermay i congratulate you on your debut novel which i have just read and thoroughly enjoyed it is indeed gripping and fairly addictive precisely as the reviews promise the plotting is beautifully crafted those hints of the disaster to come are dropped to devastating effect thriller yes but a literary one too you have a wonderfully expressive lick of language that tickles and delights and the pleasure that your writing affords is more than the hedonistic joy of a rollicking ride to the chase there are also the deeper themes of morality and self deception and the mystery of erotic attraction and although i've never been east of berlin myself i'm sure that your portrayal of the wild east is absolutely authentic a colleague of yours at the economist edward lucas writes on the browser's feature five books i think the country is really run by what amounts to a gangster syndicate which is ruthless in its pursuit of wealth and power and distorts the machinery of the state in order to achieve that and to perpetrate crimes against the russian people so i think russia is worse than the slightly sanitised picture we get in the media not least because of libel laws that mean it's quite hard to write clearly and bluntly about some of the people involved in that piece he recommends it was a long time ago and it never happened anyway russia and the communist past saying that its author david satter feels that the soviet union hollowed out both public and private morality and left people without a moral compass when it collapsed he highlights some of the extraordinary instances of casual amoral treatment of people by the system and by other people in the book it's quite a pessimistic book he feels russia has been poisoned by the soviet past and until that poison is out of the system it is going to be sickened by it i would imagine that this is a view that you entirely subscribe to as the snowdrop symbolism in your book might indicate however i'm afraid that this letter is not mere gushing fan mail i am intrigued by a question that you may be able to help me with was it some kind of quibbling doubt about the authenticity of your tale that made you embed it in a framework a framework that claims the whole book was written by nick platt as a confession to his fiancee before the big day i'm utterly at a loss to comprehend why you would find it necessary to make such a pretence i see from your biography that you studied literature i daresay you know of barbara herrnstein smith's theory that the fictiveness of novels resides not in the mimesis of the world but in the mimesis of speaking of telling the essential fictiveness of novels is not to be discovered in the unreality of the characters objects and events alluded to but in the unreality of the alludings themselves in other words in a novel or tale it is the act of reporting events the act of describing persons and referring to places that is fictive the novel represents the verbal action of a man reporting describing and referring now i would say that this is an accepted convention of novels not since the very early days of renaissance fiction have authors felt it necessary to authenticate their narrative by claiming that it is a manuscript that has been discovered and 'edited' rather than invented that may well have been due to a leftover medieval distrust of 'inventio' surely nowadays we appreciate a well imagined tale and can accept it as such my feeling was that in drawing attention to the motivation behind writing down this beautifully crafted story in fact in the end detracts from it whereas i can believe completely and implicitly in the moscow that you conjure up before my eyes so vividly i cannot swallow the idea of a man making such an incriminating confession to the woman he hopes to marry unless of course he actually wants to back out of the commitment ah is that what you mean is nick deliberately scuppering his chances because i don't believe that his wedding will go ahead now not i might add because of doubts based on his moral degeneracy but rather because he reveals his lack of passion for the future mrs platt but then the extra layer of intriguing puzzle is precisely what lifts this out of your ornery thriller category so maybe that was the effect you desired to get the reader thinking chapeau monsieur yours karen","662":"i enjoyed the book it reminded me in many ways of the story told by stephen leather in 'private dancer' where an expat in thailand is taken advantage of i haven't been to russia yet however this book painted a picture that matched my understanding a very cold place in winter that is still finding its way in the post communist period the story is told in an interesting fashion as a confession to his wife to be so you know from the start things are going 5to end badly in the story that is being told my main criticism was that i struggled to believe that the loans from the banks would have been dealt with in such a cavalier fashion given the money involved the way the middle aged lawyer was set up was very credible i smiled as i read how easy it is to get a man to allow his little head to guide his big head we really are a stupid gender even after the conclusion of the scam he still wanted to see masha again i would recommend this to anyone wanting a window into russia sad and lonely middle aged men and trust","663":"i think i was expecting something a little more spectactular but a good read not sure i want to go to moscow though","664":" this novel which was curiously shortlisted for the 2011 booker prize is set in moscow during the go go 1990s when the russian economy opened up to foreign investment and a select few became multi millionaires the narrator is a 38 year old british lawyer whose firm has sent him there to negotiate corporate deals and make money for the firm's clients he sees a robbery taking place on a moscow metro station and prevents a thief from robbing the purse of a young russian beauty naturally they strike up a conversation exchange phone numbers meet and quickly become lovers yawn she and her sister introduce him to their aunt and the three women encourage our naive and clueless narrator to provide legal assistance and financial support to the aunt's desire to buy property outside of the city can you see where this is going do you care where this is going if so or like me are driven to complete the booker prize shortlist or longlist go ahead and read this book which earns 1 1\/2  stars from me otherwise i would ask for a refund if you've already purchased it or strike it from your wish list","665":"i just finished this novel and really enjoyed it it is the best book i've read in a long time the author really knows how to engage the reader i may be a bit biased having been to russia and having a fascination for russia so take that on board before taking my recommendation but a most enjoyable read","666":"definitely keeps you interested a riveting story that is just missing that something to make it perfect i would recommend it to others though","667":"i enjoyed this book but found it really odd it's written in the most passive voice and manner nothing really happens and yet it was engaging it felt like a great comment on the ennui of life","668":"this book drips with authenticity a frightening thriller by a reporter who really knows russia and especially moscow","669":"snowdrops is one of those novels that has a quality than you'd expect while reading it a d miller in his debut depicts moscow as a place where deceit can take on a disguise a foreigner wouldn't expect where everybody gets tainted by the lawlessness of the place the novels main character a british lawyer called nick tells the story of his time in moscow when he was sucked in by two young girls masha and katya who use him for a scheme telling more about it would ruin the plot for a long time i felt i was just reading a run of the mill spionage thriller plot not wanting to spend too much time reading it i even wondered what made this book so extraordinary that it warranted a nomination for the booker prize granted the pace of the book is great the suspense works and you get the feeling that something ugly is around the corner or better underneath the snow because the title snowdrops refers to the bodies that reappear on the streets in moscow when the snow and the frost have gone would i recommend the book i don't now it wasn't great it was correct that it didn't win the booker prize but one way or another i did want to keep reading because i wanted to know how the story ended","670":"bought this book for 50p i'd tried to read it before but didn't get past the first few pages this time i stuck with it and really enjoyed it have to say that russia doesn't come across very well slightly bemused at the naivety of the main character would he really be that gullible possibly i do wonder how accurate it is about russian life if it is accurate sounds a grim place over all a very good read","671":"this was a surprisingly good read you can almost feel the chill of moscow through your bones beautifully written although a somewhat simple story with just enough foreshadowing it makes you want to keep turning the pages","672":"i was disappointed by the book as i thought when i bought it billed as shortlisted for the man booker prize and with great reviews i would love it i did feel drawn in by the atmospheric description of life in post ussr russia but i found the relationship between the narrating character and the woman he got involved with masha irritating and the complications of corruption overblown","673":"this is a very ordinary book i could not get into the style of writing and the story did not engage","674":"this is one of those books where the narrator is meant to be partly in the dark and unaware of what is going on it worked so well that i felt in the dark too and had to piece it all together after i'd finished it sadly i'm not sure it was worth the extra work i didn't see the attraction in the female romantic lead either and without it the main character's actions are pretty impenetrable","675":"this book what a bit of a disappointment i heard a little bit of it read by the author on the culture show and it sounded really good i thought i was going to choose it as my next book club book but on reading it i changed my mind it was too light weight to encourage much discussion and i thought the characters were a bit thin i am actually amazed that it made the booker prize list i wouldn't vote for it","676":"if you can get over the fact that the story which is creepingly inevitable is a vehicle for an ex pat's insider view on russia then this book really is a very interesting read and it is interesting thanks to the same things that make russia itself a fascinating place that is the sense that just about anything could be awaiting you around the corner things you had never seen or experienced before by this i don't just mean shocking events themselves of which there are many in this book as in the country but rather it's the observation of all facets of life the extreme weather the sordid ex pat lifestyles the corruption the sheer cynicism and apparent hardness of people to one another the seemingly moral less society all set within the gladiatorial city as he at one point very aptly describes moscow having spent three years as the moscow correspondent for the economist he does does an excellent job of conveying the realities of life in what is really still a rapidly evolving and in some aspects regressing country on the flip side many observations may not be as relevant to those readers who've not been through a moscow ex pat existence i also do wonder whether a russian or indeed a non brit ex pat would have drawn on the same impressions for his characterization of moscow life is through his oft steamed up but most certainly british glasses he comments at one point that he misses being apologized to when he steps on peoples' toes in the metro as he would in london overall though the book's only real down point is that much like the publication he used to write for he has very little positive to say about the country for example no characters in this book save maybe the babushka have much good going for them this despite the fact that he says he felt more alive in his 38 years of life in russia than anywhere else i suspect that despite his experiences it's the protagonist's love of and fascination for the people of russia that made him feel that way they can of course be cold and calculating manipulative and uncaring but he is drawn by their emotional openness and directness their depth and warmth so deeply that he lets himself be ridden by the wave reading this book the economist or indeed the bbc you'd wonder why on earth anyone would have anything to do with the country had they any choice in the matter and miller passed up a good opportunity to tell us","677":"i really enjoyed how realistic the descriptions of moscow and russian people were having been there myself and experienced a lot of what was described i found that part of the book very enjoyable nothing else about it was enjoyable though i detest the main character that doesn't seem to be fazed by the horrible things going on around him and doesn't mind participating either i hate that russia has a society i'm which these things can happen to people and i'm happy that my family left that country and i didn't have to be raised there","678":"terrible thank goodness i bought it second hand and never paid full price for it what an anticlimax","679":"russia is shit the end","680":"well i don't know that was shortlisted for the man booker prize 2011 load of nothing","681":"business as usual with women working the crowd there is korean bars in hawaii that willtake the money just as fast to the young and innocence","682":" i finished this book with a sense of confusion and with contrasting opinions of what i had just read the overriding feeling was one of frustration that this was an opportunity missed by the author using modern day russia to provide the backdrop to the book was a welcome change from the gulags and tsars which are often synonymous with russian literature the russia that miller penned was a dark dangerous hedonistic and exciting place and this carried the story for a long time there is something magical about a russian winter and this hid some of the cracks that appeared in the narrative in the second half of the book i felt a promising idea fell away into a story which i felt lacked a certain amount of depth","683":"loved this book read it in one night just needed to know what happened nice take on a modern noir","684":" very evocative of russia and the expat world there it's an easy read even if there's nothing too deep here and probably not much will stay with me other than an even more decreased desire to go to russia which doesn't come off at all well at points the language rather silly the air smelled of cheap petrol grilled meat and lust especially at the beginning but that was good for a laugh at the author's expense and he tones that down as the book goes on there are some other issues this won't be mistaken for great literature but i did enjoy it i read this via audiobook and the narrator was also rather annoying when reading dialogue of some of the russians especially the old lady where he did a grating awful impression but most of the book was in first person of the brit so it wasn't too annoying","685":"hard to know what to say i did enjoy it but didn't feel it was anything special it was easy to read and kept my interest well enough","686":"well written","687":"brillant read love the setting moscow the writer has a very feel for russia and convey's the atmosphere so well you can see things in your mark always the hallmark of a very good book","688":"living the good life as a lawyer in moscow nick enjoys the benefits that money brings in a city that is teeming with temptation it doesn't matter that the legal expertise that nick provides is ethically questionable but his morality or lack there of is tested when he meets the seductive sisters masha and katya initially intrigued by a moscow that is unfamiliar to me but the structure of nick writing a confessional story to his would be wife is irritating and unnecessary and eventually it is clear to this reader that nick is neither like able nor hate able he barely registers which makes it close to impossible to generate an emotional response the ending is quite the fizzle","689":" why this was long listed for the man booker prize we will never know in this case i may have to agree with angel's assessment of how she doesn't pay attention to booker prize nominees it's like he sat down with an expat lawyer banker accountant in a moscow bar club one of the many he describes and wrote the story of their perceptions of moscow and russians and their encounters it's the story of so many who lived in the city we arrived in but perhaps not the one we left 'that's what i learned when my last russian winter thawed the lesson wasn't about russia you learn about yourself 'moscow russia does do that to one you don't know what you are capable of till you live there this is not new","690":"interesting story written by a british expat living in moscow i liked his descriptions of russia especially his accurate betrayal of the cold","691":"this book is set in russia and is a fish out of water story with a slight murder mystery it says 278 pages but the spacing was rather generous and each page has 24 lines on it i don't quite know what to say about the book it's based on the author's experience a d miller travelled across russia for his job but i found the lead character nick rather all too willing to get mixed up with the wrong people and quite easily led and we're not talking about a mixed up teenager here but an adult i found the story obvious i found the writing very easy to read but lacking in any real style i would have like to have known more about 'the bad guys' however i'm sure there are people who will love this book it gives a view of russia albeit with a few stereotypes as i mentioned it's very easy to read and you'll finish it quickly maybe therefore it's a good compliment to some heavier stuff if all the year were playing holidays overall certainly no less than 3 stars but it could have been a lot better","692":"if you can read it without asking does this make sense then it's probably a good suspense book the characters do not behave in believable ways","693":"not a bad read covers a lot about russia after the breakup of the ussr through the eyes of a lawyer who is working there the deceit","694":" i liked this it's a relatively slight plot about a hapless ex pat uk lawyer in post soviet russia the wild east who gets sucked into a shabby scam and other irregularities it is written in the form of a confession to his new partner who he hopes will forgive him for whatever misdeeds he's committed the style crackles like a modern raymond chandler with a succession of witty mostly one liners while as other reviewers point out the story has strong echoes of graham greene the good man in russia gone bad the picture of corruption and how things work in modern russia is sharply drawn and frankly often entertaining which of course is the point like russia the story draws you in and repels you simultaneously","695":" snowdrops is a bleak heart rending book filled with unlike able characters and a peep at the worst side of russia the title and its explanation in the opening pages reveals that there is not going to be a happy ending to this story and yet it was totally gripping even though it is fairly clear where the plot will go nicholas platt the narrator is a kind of half man who has no understanding of himself or his place in the world and has therefore simply allowed himself to drift through life his self justification throughout the book is loathsome but even when i felt his actions stretched the bounds of credibility i believed his character would do as he did the same applied to masha katya and the cossack all were so totally without heart as to be almost caricatures but retained a believability i think this is because their characters are mirrored in the landscape architecture and environment of moscow which is so beautifully portrayed tatianna vladimirovna is the only likeable character in the book and her story is probably what carries the novel out of the mire that is the horribleness of the others her russia was one of suffering the seige of leningrad stalinism but also the russia of picking mushrooms and the love for her dead husband","696":"by no means a mind blower but scintillating enough in it's own way a russian read sans espionage that somehow retains that ol' bourne identity feel or maybe that's just a me heart matt damon jason bourne i don't know personal fantasies aside it also offers an interesting exploration of ethnocentrism greed and our willingness desire to be manipulated so long as sex lust u0026amp cold hard cash involved","697":"enjoyable would recommend it but was a little disappointed expected more being the 2011 booker prize winner enjoyed the description of life in moscow if rather depressing at times the main character l didn't get at all in fact l found him rather annoying having said that would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller","698":"beautifully atmospheric and thoroughly a twist that sneaks up silently gripping with","699":"great bookvery interesting reading about russia and some of its interesting people it's not a long book but a good length and long enough to tell it's story very enjoyable","700":"a chilling fable of a brit in modern russia magnificent","701":"decent read nicely written the author paints a interesting picture of current day russia it's actually kind of depressing all about money and destroying the lives of naive old ladies the moral of the story every russian chick is a con artist","702":"i wavered between 3 and 4 stars for this book i did enjoy reading it and certainly the first 3 4 of the book i wanted to keep reading some great description of winter in moscow which i could relate to having been there with work in january 97 but i wasn't very happy with the end it was too predictable almost petering out with no real high point to finish on then again a debut novel of pretty good standard so maybe i'll change it to a 4","703":"paints a frightening picture of russia but an enjoyable if strange journey through a part of the world i will probably never visit now","704":"i really enjoyed this book miller captures beautifully the discomfort of being an expat together with the hardship of living in moscow highly original","705":"atmospheric and gripping well paced i came away with a cold picture of the post soviet experience though not any changed view on storytelling r literature more a 3 5 than a 3 i think","706":"snowdrops is a beautiful title for a rather nasty story a d miller makes no excuses he sets things up right from the beginning he explains what a snowdrop means in russia he evokes a sense of impending doom and atmosphere marvellously constructed cleverly it is narrated in first person to the woman whom the narrator would be married to shortly as a confession snowdrops is about love addiction greed corruption and perhaps no redemption miller creates characters and slowly adds layers to them and with each layer our perspective changes snowdrops is a short novel it is not as introspective as 'a sense of an ending' and it does tell a good story tatianana vladimirnova is one character that will stay with me for some time at the end of the novel we are left with nothing but helpless rage towards the narrator perhaps that is miller's triumph i must add here that had snowdrops not been on the booker 2011 short longlist it would have gone under my radar thanks to the booker i got to read it","707":"i'm reading this novel merely because i have read 3 other shortlisted books pigeon english the sense of an ending and half blood blues and felt like i have to read this novel this novel has that intense feel when you read it it builds up from one page to another i read a review from guardian that stated reading this novel you know something bad is going to happen but you just don't know what it is that's what i felt when reading this novel this is psychological novel told by the main character as if we are part of his daily life in russia and i love how sarcasm nicholas could be dthis is definitely not for everybody since the theme is quite serious and among the other 3 books that i've read i still prefer half blood blues over the sense of an ending it's just my preference worth to read if you want to know more about russia in general it will either put you in a shock mode or cynicism","708":"ho hum what could really be worse than a confession letter from a rather dull narrator to his not even a character other than the you to which the novel is addressed fiancee the answer is very little indeed i knew what was going to happen early and then as it unfolded it was really pretty much torture why not a one star rating you ask well i managed to finish it and it did at times provide mild amusement also it was mercifully short some recommendation","709":"this extremely quick read is about a british guy who lives in russia he meets two russian women who are sisters katya and masha they ask him for business help in getting their aunt to sell her apartment the story wasn't particularly deep nor did it have as many twists as reviews promised the ending left me feeling kind of flat and disappointed and i wanted the story to resolve itself better it wasn't a great book by any means","710":"very readable from beginning to end it starts out with the narrator recounting the discovery of a body in the thawed snow at the end of a long moscow winter the narrator then goes back in the form of telling all to his soon to be wife to the beginning of the winter and tells a noirish story of getting entrapped deeper and deeper by two young attractive russian sisters because of the framing device the reader knows that nothing is on the level that the narrator is being trapped in some scheme but also that it will end ok for him because he's the one telling the story and it is hard to believe that the narrator himself in real time did not realize that nothing was on the level although it increasingly does dawn on him the story itself is simple with no major or unexpected revelations the interest is in the noirish narration the depicition of moscow in the 2000s the interesting characters of the two young russian women masha and katya and the narrator himself","711":" nick is a corporate lawyer an english ex pat living in moscow working for his parent banking company to faciliate the building of an oil supply tanker in murmansk one day on the metro he saves a girl masha from being robbed of her handbag and becomes friendly with her and her cousin katya friendship deepening into a sexual relationship masha introduces nick to her aunt who lives in a big old flat in central moscow and the narrative unfolds in which nick is surrounded by deceit and corruption and becomes gently implicit the descriptions of russian culture and lifestyle are beguiling and well written the causal corruption in which any transaction has a backhander price in which the dreams of altruistic communisim have given way to an animalistic survival of fittest the symbiotic relationship between the narrative the extremity of russian winter and the nature of the russian psyche are nicely put together there is an overall air of menace not just in central narrative but in the shadowy presence of gangsters oligarchs women as currency mistresess strippers prostitutes and the sense that all is defined by price and not human compassion however it feels like not much happens in the book as it is very clear where things are going from the outset and that it can't end well the framing of the book as a story that nick is telling his future wife and seeking absolution is interesting but a little irritating a final note the cover is brilliant one way up it reads 'snowdrops' a macabre play on words between a beautiful flower symbolising the triumph of spring over winter and russian slang for something far more sinister but the other way up it looks like cyrillic writing a nice touch","712":"beautifully written keeps you guessing","713":" a brief but compelling thriller set in moscow during its 'wild east' years after communism crumbled and all the country's wealth was snuffled up by its criminals and 'businessmen' whose only business was business heartbreaking as money disappeared and the future was buried in this book an english expat an attorney in moscow is part of not one but two such situations one in his business life as he and an italian partner negotate enormous bank loans for a wheeler dealer known as 'the cossack' who is building an oil terminal in the far north the other in his personal life where two attractive women take up with him and well he knows it's not going to end well but he'd like to believe at least for a moment but the plot is the least interesting thing about the book what makes it worth the read is the author's understanding of russia his descriptions of people his knowledge of their way of doing business his sense of 1990s moscow but also russia at any time and any place the man just has such a feeling for the country for the weather normally in the winter you can expect twenty or thirty seconds of leftover warmth after you step out of a car or leave a building before the heat of inside wears off and you suddenly feel the cold a temporary delusion of comfort like the extra time a decapitated chicken gets to run around before it realizes it's dead you don't get that period of grace at minus twenty seven it twas instant nostril freeze and eye water while i'd been away in england someone in the office had taken off a glove to answer his mobile in paveletskaya square and the phone had frozen to his palm the joys of this book are in the incidentals but so what sometimes the hors d'oevres are better than the meal","714":"absolutely loved this book and the insight into modern day russia assume it was realistic","715":"depressing dark and cold atmosphere people and story","716":" it's rare for me to feel this way but i absolutely hated this book on reading earlier reviews i was expecting a russian epic but the reality couldn't have been more different the characters were very 2 dimensional and completely unlikeable so much do that try as i might i couldn't find any redeeming features in them writing the main story in the form of a letter seemed unnecessary and didn't really work for me there was too much dialogue and it often felt that the author himself only made token references to the recipient of the letter why a letter why was the writer of the letter unable to discuss this period of his life was glad to finish this book the plot wasn't engaging and i found that i didn't really care what happened to the characters boring and random","717":"the dark humour resonated with me and i'd recommend it to certain friends on that alone i found it interesting as an exploration of how as people we determine our moral standards but the plot was too weak to find the story exciting there seemed to be so many opportunities for the author to take the story further or add a twist and i found myself thinking 'is that it 'good russian accents though","718":"read sky's review here","719":"keeps the attention but only mildly interesting","720":" this was definitely a five star read for the first half this is not the russia of old russian literature or even of john lecarre it is the russia of late night channel 4 documentaries post soviet gangsters greed and violence i rattled through the story until i began to realise the inevitable conclusion then i slowed down and began to feel the real tragedy of the situation that had been created perhaps that means it was a five star read but perhaps i'd have liked it better if the characters in the story felt as sad as i did","721":" i find this one a little difficult to review as there were some good aspects to this but i also had some issues with it trying to weigh up a score was tricky as i can't really say i liked it but defining what i didn't like about it took some thinking my conclusions are that it all conmes down to style ironically what is one of the main strengths of the writing is also the biggest weakness miller does an awesome job at creating the sense of russia moscow and that odd sort of disconnected displacement you feel from being a stranger in a strange land however he does such a good job at creating this sense of dislocation and distance that it ebbed through to my ability to connect with the story being told in much the same way as the lead character fails to really make any deep connections with those around him so too did i fail to quite frankly give two hoots about any of the people contained within these pages there was no sense of tension or concern for any of the people being written about to either drive me onwards in my reading or invest any time or energy in caring what happened to them they could have won the lottery they could have all been kidnapped and tortured at length by russian mafia it would have caused the exact same impression in me zero having said that though it's the atmosphere and location that really come alive to fill this void whether you find the chilly remoteness of moscow and its' inhabitants a sufficient trade off for character you actually care about probably comes down to the tastes of the reader","722":" a d miller writes for the economist and this first novel was shortlisted for the booker prize it is an accurate representation of the corruption in modern russia and an examination of a morally challenged english lawyer working there he chooses not to see beyond the surface of his relationship with masha katya and tatiana contributing to the decadence buried beneath that surface p 77 there are mp ex kgb men just like the president says p 211 they were both old enough to have believed in something even if the thing they'd believed in had turned out to be a sham the younger ones most of them had nothing to believe in even if they had wanted to no communism no god even the memory of god had been forgotten","723":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here well this book definitely has got a potential unfortunately in the end all the reader gets is a regular slow paced story with predictable ending i liked the descriptions of nature and the surroundings and you could learn few things about russia and moscow in particular but for me it just wasn't interesting enough","724":"a d miller's snowdrops paints a bleaker than bleak portrait of modern russia a frigid wasteland populated with criminals whores and victims criminals in this case is a word that encompasses a wide range of individuals from lowly pickpockets to corrupt building inspectors to powerful politicians the title by the way refers to the russian slang term given to anonymous bodies found in the snow mostly homeless people who succumb to the weather many of these snowdrops are also victims of murder most of which go unsolved the narrator of the story is a british lawyer living and working in moscow he begins to develop a love hate relationship with the city and the country as a whole when he meets and falls in love with masha and katya they claim to be sisters and college students but nothing they say ever really adds up to anything resembling truth while miller's almost journalistic reportage of the everyday corruption that abounds in russia is fascinating his noir ish tale of a long con never really develops into anything exciting maybe it's because the narrator of the story is so amazingly stupid it's never fully clear from the unreliability of the narrator whether he was just so naive that he couldn't see that he was being played or that he knew from the beginning that he was being played but didn't care because he was being played by two young russian hotties in either case the idiot deserved exactly what he got which sadly turns out to be nothing the loss of some money maybe a little pride whoop dee do at the very least he should have gotten a raging case of the clap don't read snowdrops expecting an exciting gorky park like or graham greene ish thriller in fact don't read snowdrops at all if you can help it","725":"this book was great at developing the atmosphere of moscow and making the city come alive as a character but unfortunately that was the only fully realized character in the book the younger russians are opaque almost caricatures tatiana vladimarovnna impossibly naive for someoone who is meant to have survived the siege of leningrad and years of stalinism and the narrator venal and dull the framing device with the english fiancee seems stuck on and is only remembered from time to time in the narrative and frankly seems completely improbable that miller is a journalist is obvious and to the book's credit the telling visual details of moscow's various milieus both homey and elitey are beautifully done but the plot takes forever to get going and when it does it's just another weary cynical anecdote better suited for an essay in the economist than as the driving force of a novel","726":"this was brilliant a narrative laden with chilling overtones yet full of humour in its sardonic descriptions of everyone and everything it's a look at modern russia from the point of view of an expat an education in its customs corruption weather the lot what a great piece of writing my best read of 2012 so far","727":" http www economist com blogs prospe this books has been getting very good reviews many of which note that it is addictive that is true but that is really not for me always indicative of a good book in this case although the writing style is simpler and more mainstream than i usually like it is still reasonably good writing although there are repetitions of several somewhat cliched terms i did not like the narrator but i think that was the point of the book he basically reminded me of every skeezy guy i met abroad and there were a lot of them i have some friends in london that are basically a version of this guy as well i am going to a book club that is reading this book so i am sure we will all discuss his psychological state and whether he didn't know or he wanted to ignore what he knew so that he could feel guilty later i kind of want some of my expat male friends to read this so we can discuss whether they have more sympathy for him i find him deeply annoying and would definitely not marry him if he wrote this to me the narrative trick being that the book is a confession to his fiancee i think that narrative trope is interesting in a russian literature sense as it has some parallels to the story of tolstoy making his wife read his diaries full of terrible stuff when they got married i assume that was intentional it would be weird if not it has some good phrases about being an expat though some of my favorite quotes were about a zhiguli car it was the sort of car that most of the men in moscow had once spent half their lives waiting to buy or so they were always telling you saving and coveting and putting their names on waiting lists to get one only to find after the wall came down they got america on tv and their better connected compatriots got late model imports that even their dreams had been shabby 16 i was a long way from things and people i didn't want to think about including myself my old self the so what lawyer with the so what life i'd left behind in london the me that you know now i was in a place where today every day almost anything might happen 101 underneath it all i suppose was the knowledge that i could have turned out the same way as my parents and the fear that maybe i still could that i might not manage to make my own life at all 113","728":" story is about an english lawyer living in moscow during the peak of the corruption and greed that created the criminal billionaires russians from every corner of the country and ex pats from europe engaged in murky dealings and signed dirty contracts abandoning morality and the law at every turn to pay off or kill whoever stood in their way to making loads of money many industrious enterprising schemes were launched as the banks happily gave out millions of course nothing was ever repaid to investors because the schemes were facades with meetings held in fake offices by fake employees of fake companies sounds familiar even the non descript luke warm lawyer nicholas comes alive and leaves his moral code at the door when he meets katya and the mysterious sexy masha kolya as nicholas is referred to by the girls becomes swept up in his relationship with masha which she expertly controls and so because all he wants is to please masha he helps the girls with some paperwork and financing which he knows is suspect as the girls connive and lead him down the garden path kolya allows himself to be led and eventually folds like a bad poker hand the seedy depraved side of moscow where girls from poland siberia and the ukraine come to hawk their sex and hook a rich man while they are still at their youthful peak comes alive drunken russians go to seedy nightclubs with ak47s in briefcases older russians who survived the war and stalin try to make their way through a society that doesn't provide any safety nets where no one appears to cares about anything or anyone from fear of the past and fear of the present people either see nothing and hear nothing or they bend over the body to grab the wallet the absurdities and complexities of russian life abound in this book and it is full of glorious images of moscow during the dreaded russian winter and the brief but sexy russian summer living in russia is not an easy life nor for the feint of heart","729":" snowdrops by a d miller is a suspenseful novel that takes place in moscow in the early 2000s at the time when financial markets became more open to foreign investment the main protagonist a british lawyer nick platt who represents a foreign financial company is in the middle of high financial transactions with a muscovite meanwhile platt falls in love with masha who seems not to be who she claims to be due to his love for masha platt is blinded to the inconsistencies she tells therefore he ignores vital evidence that would prevent the selling of an elderly women's moscow apartment which possibly leaves her homeless or dead platt's indifference to possible risks with the muscovite financier leads to highly financial risks in the billions for his company miller paints a picture of secret schemes in the shadows of corruptions at multiple levels no one seems to be who they claim to be including platt","730":"so evocative of the moscow i remember","731":"i'm about to comment on this book on my blog http www joanccurtis com i'll just say that i was profoundly disappointed in this book the reviews indicated that it was plot driven my question is what was the plot nothing about this book drove me i wonder why i finished it i suppose i kept hoping for more unless you want to take a snooze shelf this one","732":"i finished the book but found the protaganist so boring and blah not even a compelling mystery don't know what gendre this book is i am having a hard time wondering why this made it to the booker long list","733":"i had high hopes for this book it's made it to the booker shortlist which i think is a first for publisher atlantic books the blurb was promising a man's descent into the corruption and immorality of russia did it deliver not really i confess that i find an unlikeable protagonist puts me off a book that's not to say that i won't get on board with a proper bad guy who is interesting enough to hold my attention unfortunately nick the english lawyer was neither likeable or interesting he was an immature selfish and sexist man who looked down on pretty much everyone around him including his own parents the object of affection masha was supposed to be an enigmatic and irresistible creature who lures nick to his demise in fact she came across and cold and quite frankly i found it difficult to fathom what made her different from her partner in crime katya the book is written as a confessional letter from nick to his now fiance someone actually agreed to marry this creep and was a nice idea but didn't really ring true the redeeming feature of this book is that the writing is excellent and the sense of place you take from the prose is second to none i was in the russian winter just a shame that the company wasn't that great","734":" the tag line of my copy describes this novel as an intense psychological drama about the irresistible allure of sin that description bears no relationship to the intensely almost aggressively dull book i just managed to finish it's written in the first person and eventually felt like a cocktail party conversation with a slightly tipsy self absorbed jerk who is unshakably convinced that you will find his rambling description of trivial dramas and trials absolutely fascinating indeed the novel is styled as a written confession by the narrator to his fiancee i hope she dumps him instantly upon realizing how tedious her future husband is to add insult to injury from the title and the opening chapters i thought it would be an exciting thriller about murder and mafia corruption instead view spoiler it's merely a drawn out description of real estate fraud hide spoiler i am

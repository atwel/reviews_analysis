enjoyed this audiobook even though some of the descriptions made me wonder what i just heard some made me stop and think that was good the author certainly enjoys the use of metaphors from the onset the narrator informs the audience she is not reliable because her memory is faulty after sitting on death row for 10 years she does nothing to try to win approval she is simply writing her story she is not looking for a way to beat the death penalty i'm not sure i fully understand why she chose to remain silent about certain things but i liked that she well i don't want to write any spoilers i decided to go back and listen again to the beginning of the book and now i think i may give it another listen all the way through knowing how the book ends changes everything the second round may warrant increasing the rating from 3 stars to 4 actually knowing that if i liked the book enough to listen to it again from the beginning it does deserve four stars so i am giving it for stars the book kept me curious all the way to end kudos to the author","2":" i liked the format of this book for most of the book you don't know why noa is on death row and what her motivations were to end up there small pieces of the puzzle are slowly revealed and the ending is satisfying because of how unsatisfactory the whole situation was i was left questioning her true personality and motives so many ordinary events leading up to a tragic end and then not just the external factors but her own inner dialogue let you see who she really is and then some shocking revelations to make for a fun read","3":"the reader is introduced to noa singleton six months from \"x day\" - november 7 - the day the state of pennsylvania has scheduled to execute her for a murder she committed ten years previously throughout her arrest trial and sentencing she did not deny or admit the crime neither did she participate in her defense in the ten years she has been in prison she has not spoken of the events that brought her to this point in life on this day she has a visitor an occurrence that was so rare that she initially did not realize she was being taken to the prison visitor's area this visitor is the mother of the woman she murdered and the lawyer the mother hired to develop a clemency plea for noa the remainder of the book fills in the gaps of how noa arrived on death row tthrough the process of getting to know noa singleton from her birth to the close of the book is wrenching the product according her mother \"of a one night stand \" noa never knew her father her mother a sometime b list actress was more interested in having a male companion than being a parent noa was a good student graduating as salutatorian of her high school class and gained admittance to penn state where her tenure lasted less than a semester as the reader learns more of noa's story the more confusing her being incarcerated becomes there is nothing in what is learned that explains her actions that have led to her awaiting being put to death i had to read the moment of revelation that lies behind her abhorrent behavior twice as it was so unexpected and shocking tthe title appears to be too graphic revealing the end of the story before the book is read in the reading \"execution\" is revealed to be multilayered execution as \"sentence\" for capital murder is evident and understandable within the story execution as \"action\" is repeatedly given description and painted in vivid colors execution as \"precision in action\" is the point of tension that gives this book its punch execution as \"implementation\" is so shocking and comes from such unexpected directions that i was given to anger sadness and surprise on repeated occasions execution as \"accomplishment\" ends the book and the completeness of the ending left me feeling the existential angst of being \"undone\" the execution mentioned in the title is focused upon noa p singleton but its action has her only as its starting point this book is part rant against the death penalty part rave in support of \"the ultimate punishment \" part study of the power of guilt and loss a portion of revenge in hopes of redemption and eventually a story of that part of the human condition where one realizes too late the cost of actions and the value of what one once held so carelessly there is adult language but not in abundance no graphic sexual moments but plenty of painful moments regarding the lives of all those connected in this story in the end no one is left unscathed in this tale noa accepted her abandonment as her due her victim was caught in a moment of attempted restoration her victim's mother sought answers by asking the wrong questions and was left bereft of solace her lawyer was faced with the reality of his profession the reader arrived at the end having tasted of the possibility of how complete a life can be in the most astounding of ways","4":"i should have read the top amazon reviews of this book","5":"intriguing story but i don't think it was executed very well kind of clunky and where was the copy editor many sentences didn't make sense and should have been cut","6":"patron review suspenseful ending not what i expected","7":"overall i remained excited about the subject of this book through the end i was left with a dangling feeling at the end but life is like that and so i can accept some of that in my reading the entire way through the book i went back and forth on whether or not i could trust noa there were moments that seemed implausible to me but for the most part i thought this was a great read i enjoyed listening to the audio version nice reader great writer i'll look for more from silver","8":" the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth silver5 starsthis book grabbed me right from the beginning the story starts out by introducing us to noa p singleton a young woman in prison due to be executed in six months one day the mother of her victim philadelphia lawyer marlene dixon shows up at the prison to tell noa that she has formed an organization called mad mothers against death and no longer believes in the death penalty she wants to use the resources of her firm to appeal to the governor for clemency on noa's behalf what she wants in exchange is for noa to tell her why she killed her daughter apparently during the trial noa never gave her lawyers any explanation and refused to testify on her own behalf the story is told from noa's perspective and i love the way the author slowly extracts the story over the course of the book the story is dispassionately narrated by noa and she weaves her way through her life and how she ended up on death row that part of the story is interspersed with visits from oliver stanstet a young lawyer preparing the clemency paperwork the other part of the story are letters marlene has written to her daughter giving us a window into the mother's actions and feelings without changing the focus of the story noa's character is extremely well done while i was reading i could never be sure she was the victim of circumstance or an evil killer who deserved to be on death row the plot is interesting and well developed with both the murder and noa's approaching execution date running in parallel i'm still thinking about it days after i have finished it it was one of the best books i've read all year","9":"interesting study of criminal law and the death penalty with a slow series of reveals which don't always clarify or seem true to character but then do we really understand what motivates anyone","10":"unlikable characters but the premise u0026amp plot were ok the writing was problematic at times u0026amp i felt she didn't go to great lengths to flesh out the characters there was a distinct lack of emotion not just in the main character but also in her adversary who really should have been an interesting character but who ended up just sort of flat and weird our book club's discussion about the book was pretty good but it's hard to say whether the author should get any credit for that since we had to work pretty hard","11":"excellent i couldn't put this book down it was so interesting and full of surprises and i highly recommend reading it","12":"book kept my interest but writing so subtle i don't even know what happened re reading might help","13":" this is a powerful novel that is thought provoking and original albeit a walk on the dark side noa p singleton has been on death row for 10 years after shooting a young pregnant woman she is thirty five years old and is resigned to her death in six months time but then the mother of her victim comes to visit her in prison wanting to put forward a clemency petition and noa is given the alluring hope that she might not be killed by lethal injection but nothing about noa's story is as it first appears and as the month's countdown to noa's execution the reader learns about her life outside the prison walls and the events that cumulated in the death of a pregnant woman the narrative style is unflinching and noa is clearly a damaged soul despite her almost black and white pronouncements about herself - but despite her alleged crime is she really guilty i found myself wanting to know more about her and hoping against hope for a happy ending and there are other characters in the novel with their own agendas and their own guilt to deal with that add to the complexity of the story i can't say what happens but the ending seems the only credible and possible outcome when all the facts emerge this novel certainly raises a lot of questions about capital punishment and elizabeth l silver seems to have nailed it when it comes to a convincing character on death row in noa who is a highly intelligent but tortured and complicated person who hasn't had an easy life it is up to you to decide if she is a victim of circumstance of if her situation is entirely of her own making - or a blend of both gripping haunting challenging this is not an easy read but i'd definitely recommend","14":"this is a really unusual story saw it on a list of books that could be this year's gone girl i had the audio book really well read and i recommend it not sure if it would be as good reading it it moves slowly and at times i found myself wondering why a certain part was in there but it all ties together in the end it is one of those books one wants to talk about i won't ruin it by telling any of the story","15":" in many ways this book reminded me of the racketeer by john grisham it's mainly narrated by a person in prison with a tone of superiority people who feel completely in control of their fate for the racketeer it's because he has a plan to get out of jail and beat everyone at their own game for noa p singleton it's because even though she's on death row she has resigned herself to her fate even embraced it because it is the only way she can control the situation the book presents a mystery which noa won't help solve even though she is the only one who can just what happened that led to the death of the woman that landed noa on death row why did noa do it did noa even do it why didn't she take the stand in her defense why does noa still keep all these secrets 10 years later and six months from her execution date the mystery slowly unravels through discussions with lawyers and flashbacks to noa's life eventually we find out noa's reasons for everything that happened the reveals are good and shocking and make sense but ultimately i felt the whole thing was a bit convoluted i'm not sure noa would wind up making the decisions she makes because of all these reasons for that i dropped the book down one star as i enjoyed the writing style and mystery but didn't love the resolution it's quite a good debut novel though fans of grisham defending jacob david baldacci and other such law thrillers will enjoy it","16":"i could not finish this book it sounded like it would be a good story mist of the time i had no idea what the author was trying to say it was distracting","17":"4 5 stars wow wowee yes you can see the similarities to the dinner in some respects this was a story i ripped through in a mere number of days excellent read looking forward to the critical era book club chat with elizabeth l silver on this one for certain","18":" a page turner is an understatement for this book bits and pieces of explanations and new information is distributed throughout the novel at a suspenseful pace silver is gifted in suspense writing this story is narrated by a 20 something year old woman noa p singleton who is on death row in pennsylvania for the murder of a college peer sarah dixon the narration unfolds the events leading up to the death murder from noa's point of view we also learn of noa's history family and life interspersed through noa's narratives are letter's written to sarah posthumously from her mother marlene marlene is a high powered attorney and is somewhat surprisingly trying to get nora a stay of execution six months before \"x day\" execution day the narrative makes it clear that marlene and noa do not like each other not one iota so the reader is left wondering what's marlene's true motive in getting noa clemency through the letters and the narrative we find marlene isn't a pillar of ethics and mores we learn noa didn't provide any defense in her trial marlene wants to know what happened at the scene of her daughter's murder the only person who can provide her that information is noa it's a cat and mouse game but who is the cat and who is the mouse noa as a narrator is caustic yet likable through her we learn some interesting facts about the penal system especially those concerning death row i liked the use of the letters from marlene to provide marlene's perspective silver furnishes just enough information to keep the reader guessing right up to the end of the novel i loved the finish great story idea","19":"noa p singleton is on death row for murder when she is approached by her victims high power attorey mother to move forward on a clemency petition we find ourselves winding through the tragic circumstances of a woman facing death and that which led up to the crime fantastic read i really loved the dramatic connection that the author compelled me to have with noa","20":"well written and intriguing premise i think if i had read this book anytime other than at night when i was already dead tired i would have appreciated it more would make an awesome beach read","21":" i rarely wait to write a review and i don't believe i've ever changed my rating upon reflection there's a first time for everything it's been a week since i finished and now i'm ready at first this book had the feeling of gone girl to me kind of twisted in a good way upon my continued reading of noa there were several times when i thought i could have happily executed noa myself and i don't believe in capital punishment do it already i thought there weren't any redeemable characters in noa somehow this worked in gone girl everyone could be bought or bribed moral decrepitude i couldn't even get behind the mother of the victim how does that happen read it you'll find out her letters to her dead daughter were sick yet i kept reading waiting for the big reveal at the end meh the writing was superfluous take this seriously as it comes from someone who often likes superfluous for example thirteen individuals marinating in the enclosed jury box like a carton of dried out fruit doesn't make sense to me marinating is the opposite of dried out right or i noticed a shadow lurking on the corner a diffident amalgamation of restraint and might all in the same amorphous splotch wth the book was rife with similes that either didn't make sense or were just so cumbersome as to think whaaa i'm demoting it to two stars and if i don't stop writing i'll demote it to one star which i almost exclusively reserve for books i couldn't finish really i don't like being ruthless","22":"this book just lacked something what it is i can't quite put my finger on the whole persephone incident was just crazy as in really she got away with that nonsense where's the police work everybody in this book was crazy and the language don't get me started noa keeps going on and on about how she's slowly forgetting how to put things into words but every time you turn around there's a pretentious word thrown in where it doesn't necessarily have to be i also didn't like the events that lead up to the crime that momma is a trip though i wouldn't recommend or re read","23":"this fast moving novel is the story of a woman sentenced to death row for the murder of her father's girlfriend a young attorney is dispatched to file one more plea for clemency 6 months before she is sentenced to die initially hardened and sarcastic noa begins to reveal more of herself as she realizes the young attorney is truly interested in helping her but this not a simple tale and there are plenty of plot twists i liked it for fans of gone gril and as i was sleeping","24":"so annoyed i quit halfway through","25":"this one started strong for the first 100 pages sagged a bit in the middle but finished a bit above average the premise is great the main protagonist is waiting on death row to be executed with all of her appeals exhausted then we learn who she killed and the circumstances are revealed gradually with an assortment of twists and turns along the way a fine first effort by this author who is not afraid to tackle tough subjects","26":" this book immediately captured my interest and i finished it it in one day i would have given this 3 5 stars overall noa is on death row for committing murder the book through flashbacks tells how noa got here and what happened at times i felt very bad for noa and kept thinking just tell the truth just tell the truth there are other characters in the book i also felt very bad for but in the end not sure if i liked them at all this book shows there are always different paths we can take and we are accountable for our actions it also explores the complexity of relationships of parents and children this is a great summer read and i would recommend this book to others","27":"excellent writing complex hard to like characters and the insights of a death row inmate make this book a thought provoking read a contemplation of motive history and layers of guilt","28":"i would give this book a 3 1 2 the storyline really kept my interest and i enjoyed the change of perspectives","29":"really not sure what to think of this my brain hurts 308 p","30":"received this book as a good reads giveaway interesting read i had some problems with a lot of big words but the story kept moving noa p is on death row for killing a young lady who was pregnant the dead girl's mother a hot shot lawyer is now trying to save her the dynamics between noa p and her mother and deadbeat father move the story along so you get a better understanding of her as you read along interesting bombshell at the end i would recommend this for a good rainy day read","31":"i definitely think this was one of the better books that i have read lately maybe not a 5 star but a good solid 4 stars this is a first time author and i thought the writing was excellent i liked the way the story unraveled a bit at a time a different and interesting plot i actually liked noa and could definitely see how she got backed into a corner someone's review said that noa was a true psychopath i thought she was normal the true psychopath in my opinion was marlene","32":"this is a page turner with unexpected revelations doled out in the latter half but it left me dissatisfied none of the characters however interesting achieved clarity in their own minds nor did they understand each other there were no winners in this book not even the reader","33":" the premise of this book is fascinating it was compared to gone girl which i loved it remarked that the narrator was unreliable which i'm a fan of in most cases despite having those things going for it this book was a dud for me with gone girl you hate everyone but you want to know what they're going to do next with this book you just don't care i felt like it was predictable flat and just overall uninteresting it got more than one star for me because i do think that the writing is solid but the characters and plot fall short i know that sounds like an oxymoron but i'm sure you understand","34":"the supposed crime that noa p singleton executed isn't revealed until the last part of the book this is both good and bad i was impatient but it prevented me from formulating a concrete opinion about noa's guilt or innocence some of her actions don't make sense given her past and i don't fully understand why she was so nonchalant about not fighting her execution but interesting issues are raised especially where the death penalty is concerned","35":"this book would have been so much better if the author's penchant for overblown and often laughable metaphors and similes had been curtailed by someone anyone plagues of seconds squired the silence between us and his heart was too visible outside his garments where it resided like lint on a week old sweater the author writes about the power of language too bad hers destroyed it","36":"i can't stand books where i have to keep looking up words in the dictionary it's one thing if the words are needed to drive home a point or description but the writing was tedious and didn't fit the characters and i just couldn't get into these characters nor could i empathize with the main character on death row the story line was interesting but just couldn't get past the writing","37":"i liked this one a lot the characters were interesting and the story had some suspense and surprises i'm reluctant to say more because i don't want to spoil how the story unfolds","38":"this book sounded so good from the description on the dust jacket i did enjoy it it was an interesting book it just was not as good as i expected","39":"i never found noa's story compelling i gave the book 2 stars because silver does a good job showing how tangled our memories become the the results of both ptsd abandoment and family dysfunction","40":"i wish i knew a head of time that this is a drama not really a mystery or thriller i liked it ok but i expected more of a grisham legal thriller and i know those aren't that trilling so that says something when it was more of a family friend drama it was ok i listened to the audio book and enjoyed the two narrators i really like it when there's more than one actor to distinguish the characters","41":"i didn't like this book i only gave it 2 stars because there was an interesting premise i finished it because i was curious to see how it wrapped up it was critically reviewed well but i really disliked the mother and had no empathy for noa i was disappointed","42":"moments of brilliance punctuating long periods of pleasant banality and now and then a sentence that even after three reads still made absolutely no sense to me found that a bit annoying as i tend to think myself fairly smart but it kept my interest and was fairly thought provoking if i had found noa likable it may have been a four star","43":"well i was hoping this book would be really good it was a compelling read because you wanted to find out what happened but over all it was just depressing and i wasn't a fan of the ending lol really didn't like the main characters at all the only character i even remotely liked was oliver","44":" as far as unreliable narrators go noa is a perfect example anticipating her execution date she slowly reveals the circumstances that brought her to death row she is not a particularly likeable character closing herself off with a defensive wall and not seeming to care about her own fate it's obvious she's keeping secrets and perhaps even trying to make up for a past wrong she feels she deserves to be exactly where she is there are occasional chapters written as letters from noa's victim's mother to her deceased daughter but this conniving and unbearable woman is just as untrustworthy as noa she had her own hand in her daughter's death and her motives are entirely selfish i would have liked this book more if the last 30 pages didn't feel so rushed and contrived i was anticipating a huge twist but noa's actions were confounding and i was left wondering what on earth she was thinking overall it's well written as far as establishing a sense of expectation and creating doubt noa was wronged in so many ways but the choices she made ultimately led her to her incarceration i received a complimentary copy of this book via the amazon vine program","45":"this book has its share of problems but it's going to stick with me for awhile i can tell you that","46":"interesting read with a thought provoking final twist but overall there are a lot of other books i'd recommend before this one it took well over a hundred pages to get it and if i hadn't been reading it for book club i think i would have abandoned it","47":"i enjoyed this book i did it was fast paced and kept me intrigued but it left me wanting more it is thought provoking for sure and i can't quite put my finger on what left me dissatisfied i hated the ending hated it but i think that's because i became so invested in the characters and the story so i definitely recommend reading the book just be warned it may leave you feeling unfinished","48":"in this whole book i found no characters i liked downer","49":"what a interesting concept for a new literary voice part confession part listening ear in this debut work silver gives you a character to cheer for but lets you into her dark confused past","50":"this book was overly long did not enjoy any of the characters a waste of time","51":"beautifully written and intriguing yet i could not like or relate to any of the characters in the book as much as i wanted to","52":"it sure if it would improve when read on paper but this book was pretty dismal on audio slow moving bleak frustratingly unlikable characters i only made it to the end because i had know what the final plot twist would be and that turned not to be worth the time","53":"excellent book a must read","54":"if you liked gone girl you will like this one as well another story very well written with unlikeable characters and a story about the truth not being evident a good discussable book about capital punishment as well","55":"wow i loved this book even though it was such a tragic story i knew from the title how it was going to end but i kept hoping for a different ending i kept turning the pages to see how all the pieces of the puzzle would come together i still feel bad for noa highly recommended","56":"really enjoyed this plot kept me guessing til the end noa p was so wracked with guilt for reasons the reader will not expect marlene evil incarnate","57":"i received this book from netgalley comwhat a book i found myself rooting for noa the entire time and really despising the victim's mother even with the knowledge that noa is a murderer i still found myself really hoping that oliver could help her get out of jail i loved how the relationships developed and though i am usually one who roots for a happily ever after ending i think the author did a great job with the plot and character development i think the last time i hated a character as much as the victim's mother was when i read gone girl definitely some twists i wasn't expecting and then of course some others i figured out overall a great book and a quick read","58":" review first published on my blog http memoriesfrombooks blogspot com noa p singleton is a death row inmate convicted of capital murder as the reader meets her she has been on death row for many years and is now a short time away from her execution date enter into the picture two attorneys one who is young and idealistic and one who happens to be the mother of noa's victim through noa's recollections the book brings the reader through her life particularly the months prior to the crime the characters in this are not likable noa appears to have no interest in her own life or trying to save it marlene is a grieving mother but as the book slowly reveals her motives go beyond that grief noa's family includes her mother who has not reached out to her since her arrest and conviction and her father who was absent for most of her life the premise of the book is a strong one dealing with issues like capitol punishment and the impact childhood has on adult life unfortunately the execution of that premise is lacking for two primary reasons first the author's writing style particularly some of the descriptions distract from the story itself for example papers and evidence eviscerate peeling into orange curls and blackened petals in the crematorium of dead documents a beating heart is described as the beat of those four musicians making their own metronome of quarter notes eighth notes half notes rather than adding to the story these descriptions seem out of place second the first half of the book builds a storyline with noa her relationship with her father and the events surrounding her crime and her lack of interest in saving her own life unfortunately the resolution and the reveal of noa's motivations for her actions goes in a completely different direction without a spoiler let me just say it was a disappointment","59":"didn't live up to the premise","60":"a well crafted story exploring guilt made death row real with a story that plays out beautifully a brilliant debut","61":"the writing style kept you thinking there would be a twist but it took way too long to get there","62":" what started off as an interesting story gradually deteriorated into an irritating blend of disturbing events in the lives of a strange range of totally unlikeable characters to say that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities is an extreme understatement it wasn't until the final pages of the novel that silver provided insight into noa's actions and offered an explanation as to the chain of events that resulted in noa's death sentence many of noa and caleb's behaviors lacked credibility and maureen's long laborious letters to sarah were more annoying than enlightening the only good thing about this book is that it's a quick read","63":"didn't really see the point of the story or ending a little disappointed","64":" 2 5 stars some interesting plot twists and i liked how the two main characters kept me guessing but the writing really got in the way mainly for me it was the heavy salting of big words used in weird ways and not weird creative unfortunately more like weird confusing or unnecessarily distracting the gray middle ground that mucous thin terrain where most of life resides is really only a temporary annex like gestation or purgatory it shadows over everyone in its vacuous and insipid cape flying across the sky making smoke letters out of your fears and the not infrequent errors like this the law has created a protected class of individuals people who on the basis of their age or status are more valuable to society if we kill someone in that precocious class of individuals then we are sentenced to death that made me suspect the writer spoke english as a second language i was surprised to read in the about the author note at the end of the book that the writer had actually taught esl i also didn't find the very very end satisfying fix that and get an aggressive editor and this could have been a great twisty thought provoking pleasure read","65":"one of those books where i kept thinking it got rave reviews what am i missing the characters were unlikeable and it made it difficult to care at all what was going to happen to anyone major disappointment","66":"it was compared to gone girl and i can't figure out why the concept is good but the writing is not the author tried too hard to tell the story in a clever way and failed","67":"awesome book love the way it was written pulling together the past present and the letters to sarah marlene needs to do more than start mad to make right all of her wrongs","68":"this book was weird and not very satisfying but i would recommend it because i was entertained enough to keep reading the entire way through","69":"i liked the premise of this book but i can't say that i really liked the book itself like many other reviewers i felt that the constant metaphors were distracting and some of them made no sense whatsoever there were parts of the book that seemed thrown in and did not really contribute to the story itself like the author had researched these things and found them interesting so she just couldn't leave them out of the book prisoners last meals for instance this probably isn't a book that i will recommend that you just have to read if i were asked about it i would merely say it was ok and not much more","70":"very compelling book that's hard to put down but ultimately a little unsatisfying","71":" the execution of noa p singleton is a story about a woman on death row her crime and her conviction noa is awaiting her death date she is one of the few people in this world that knows exactly when she will die and by what means it will be lethal injection on november 7th it is ten years since she committed her crime noa is resigned to her death but yet another young lawyer believes he can win an appeal or at the very least get her clemency you see the deceased's mother has decided that the death penalty is wrong but the relationship between noa and the deceased's mother is not what it first appears i won't go into the plot anymore because this really is a novel with twists and turns and you need to read it without expectation to be drawn into noa's small cell and her mind but i will say i never felt all that much sympathy for her character for her predicament yes i do not believe in the death penalty we abolished that in the uk years ago now i reflect on this book i actually don't think any of the characters are very likeable but of course you see them all through noa's eyes overall the execution of noa p singleton is a good thrilling read it's full of ways that situations actions words can be manipulated i got a little bored in the middle after all this is an account in retrospect the action has already taken place it's really interested in the how and the why but i'm glad i read it a book which makes you think about life and death crime and punishment justice and injustice is always worth reading source borrowed from the public library","72":"noa p singleton never spoke in her own defense throughout a trial that ended a first degree murder guilty verdict ten years later as she sits on death row just six months away from her execution date she is visited by marlene dixon the mother of the woman noa killed marlene tells noa that she will do everything in her considerable power to convince the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison if she tells the story of her daughter's murder interesting and page turning novel","73":" after pushing through the story to the end i realized that i couldn't find anything to recommend aside from it being a book with some words that might challenge an already challenged vocabulary the story was compelling in that i'd already invested too much effort into the reading to not know how it ended one of the characters simply slips off to nothingness and the others are only interesting in their relation or lack thereof to the other characters slap a bunch of dysfunctional people into a story and something bizarre is certain to form this is that i would not recommend this to anyone that enjoys reading quality suspense mystery books","74":"interesting novel that made me think","75":"this book broke my god damn heart","76":"i wanted to read this book for a long time and when i finally did i was completely let down i couldn't connect with noa and so i didn't find her to be a compelling character and even after finishing and knowing the mystery of sarah's death i still didn't find her that compelling she was just an immature girl with some serious mommy issues i don't subscribe to the idea that you have like a character hello amy and nick dunne but they need to be at least a little interesting also if i wanted to read about how screwed up our justice system is i would read non fiction","77":"i thought this book was actually pretty bad i wanted to like it because the concept interested me but the writing was choppy and the characters were one dimensional and overall unlikable and unrelatable definitely would not recommend","78":"i liked the story and i would have given it 5 stars but i do not like unsettled endings that is not why i read i don't want to imagine what happens next you the author are supposed to tell me what happens exposition rising action climax falling action resolution don't leave me hanging me no likee","79":"oh my goodness this book was amazing and i recommend it to all of my friends whenever i can noa is such a wonderfully crafted character and to see her fate unfold makes the book a page turner and heart breaker as the title implies there is no happy ending for noa and this follows the reader throughout the entire novel leaving you constantly wondering what justice really is and how we perceive proper punishment","80":"this is really a 3 5 star review i enjoyed reading this i certainly plowed through it quickly especially at the end but it has some first novel problems the whole thing is tied up into too neat a bow and too many pieces of the plot rest on characters doing things that they only do to serve the plot the villains are barely human and too much is left to coincidence but it's a page turner and the characters are interesting","81":"i was really enjoying the suspense of the story unfolding but i found the choice of ending very disappointing i thought there were several other possibilities that would make this a stronger book","82":"meh interesting premise glad i got through it quickly that's all i've got to say about this one","83":" the first 90% of this book was fantastic there were twists and turns and mysteriousness that kept me turning pages because i had to know what happened then when i found out what happened i was annoyed because it was ridiculous a description i read claimed this book was a cross between before i go to sleep and defending jacob i definitely see the similarities to defending jacob so if you enjoyed that book you'll enjoy this one too but i don't get the comparison to before i go to sleep other than you don't know who you can trust in this story i'd still recommend it if you enjoy legal thrillers because this was definitely one and i did not see the ending coming at all absolutely worth the read","84":"wow wow that is all","85":"maybe 3 5 stars not sure what in the hell i'm not actually sure of my feelings about this book but i will say that this lady can tell a story i found it a bit slow at first by about 1 3 of the way in i was hooked if only so i could figure out what the hell was the deal with noa i can't really review too much without spoilers but i will say it was suspenseful interesting and for the most part i enjoyed reading it","86":"i can't say i liked this book i can say it was a compelling read and very thought provoking","87":" i absolutely loved loved loved this book i feel bad for the other readers who did not enjoy this novel as much as i did there's a underlying moral tone to this book that i think some people just didn't get the truth is not all books end up the way we want and there's not always the closure you want to feel when you turn the last page that's exactly what makes this book so real it's not vampires and zombies and make believe it's the real world it's the decisions we make and have to live with and just pure human nature the author didn't write this book so you would like the characters in fact i think she wrote it in a way that we see exactly the kind of people they are real humans just like the rest of us making good and bad decisions and paying the consequences i think it is an amazing first novel for this author and can only hope that she continues to write with this kind of passion i had a hard time putting it down excellent read highly recommend","88":"i think this book would make an excellent movie it is full of questions and twists and turns to get answers it is about guilt bad parenting and misguided self evaluation","89":"meh i realized about halfway through that i didn't care what happened and i still am not really sure what did happen","90":"sometimes tedious exploration of a woman's last chance at escaping death row realistically i'd give this two and a half stars silver's awkward technique of interspersing letters to the victim as written by her mom is balanced out by a thought provoking ending the suspense builds as noa reveals the story that led her to where she narrates from still i wasn't sold on the book as a whole","91":"a fast read interesting premise and slowly revealed twists and turns i enjoyed reading this but the author unfortunately suffers from metaphor itis as well as similes ad nauseum","92":"thought provoking and well plotted","93":"noa p singleton recounts her last months in prison and events leading up to her conviction noa is complex and vulnerable many are willing to befriend her and an evil adversary propel the narrative some startling twists made this book hard to put down","94":"2 5 stars it was ok disclaimer i don't think it's a bad book at all i really enjoyed the writing but the resolution was not my cup of tea perhaps other people won't share my feelings it's very hard to review this book without giving spoilers all i can say is that noa p singleton has been on death row for ten years and her execution date is six months away when marlene dixon the mother of the woman she was found guilty of murdering a lawyer herself and oliver stansted another lawyer visit her and propose to work on a clemency application the rest of book is noa recounting all the little events in her life from birth that got her to where she is you'll have to read the whole book to find out if she's executed or not although many things didn't really click with me the story did make me wonder if we can truly escape our circumstances it made me revisit my stance on the death penalty and perhaps also gave me some thoughts on gun control but perhaps that's just me veredict give it a chance","95":" solid performances by the audio readers so my review does not reflect their efforts as a lawyer this book is so fraught with ethical violations and impossible situations as to be really too much in terms of characters spare us lord from yet another book where there is not a single likeable character much less a main character who acts in exactly the opposite manner she should in every situation she's incomprehensible unbelievable and frustrating her less than picket fence upbringing notwithstanding and the similes oh the similes my favorite was plangent and percussive like the whelp of a police baton i'll leave it at that the story of a death row inmate in her last days deserved so much more","96":"this was an interesting novel noa is on death row for capital murder in her trial she said nothing and has said nothing since along come a woman to help her in an attempt to get clemency but oddly it is the victims mother who is willing to help if only noa will tell her what really happened i enjoyed the book i was curious as to how a person could remain quite for so long on death row the novel was well written the main character was witty and very easy to like","97":"excellent book could not put down","98":"a terrible book aspiring to be both literary novel and gripping mystery and failing at both a woman on death row is visited by the mother of the girl she murdered who now wants to fight for her clemency silver started with one interesting idea then abandons it nasty and one dimensional characters huge leaps of logic convoluted prose and the revelation of secrets that the reader is past caring about painfully bad","99":" the book held my attention from beginning to end the reader was pretty effective although at times she seemed to be in the wrong character's speaking voice her expression was excellent however the narrative was sharp and very descriptive presenting a clear picture of a young woman on death row it was presented almost like a lecture or a dissertation the main character showed little emotion and the dialogue perfectly represented her personality it was a presentation of facts but often the reader could not be sure if they were true or false i was constantly drawing different conclusions and making incorrect guesses to solve the mystery the audio begins with a brief introduction to noa a woman of a very checkered past who is engaged in a prison interview a death row interview where she has been for 10 years she has no remaining appeals and will be executed in six months noa is very bright but not a well adjusted human being she once wanted to be a doctor but left school after one year and abandoned her ambitions this new lawyer represents a newly formed group called mad mothers against death the founder is actually marlene dixon the mother of noa's murder victim sarah dixon she is a powerful woman who knows anyone who is anyone she uses her wiles to get her way and her power and information to intellectually blackmail those she needs to control she insists she no longer wants noa to be sentenced to death and will write an appeal for clemency although at noa's trial she petitioned the court for the death penalty she says that an appeal from the mother of the victim will usually be granted oliver is the young lawyer who comes to interview her and believes marlene's motives and objectives are genuine oliver and noa develop a warm relationship and he asks her to write her memoir to explain who she was he tells her to send it to marlene when she is finished noa was brought up by a single parent a rather no account wannabe actress who did a lot of sleeping around she has a ne'er do well brother whom she rarely sees growing up she did not know her father there are many devastating and traumatic secrets in noa's life that are slowly revealed as the book progresses when her father reappears she is drawn into the maelstrom that is his life when she discovers he is having an affair with sarah a girl her age trouble and tragedy follow marlene sarah's mother wants the relationship ended and asks for noa's help her father begs for her help when the relationship goes further than he wants it to go sarah is very much caught in the middle through a series of letters from marlene dixon to her deceased daughter and the information in noa's memoir the details of the crime and of noa's background are revealed i found the interrogation and trial testimony interesting especially with the way information was presented and manipulated emotion and innuendo can easily sentence a person to death and i kept wondering if noa was framed there seemed to be several miscarriages of justice occurring also the facts kept pointing in different directions there was no shortage of people willing to testify against the accused to have their fifteen minutes of fame i did not admire any of the characters they were far from stellar individuals none seemed to live in the real world but rather a world they created around themselves to satisfy their needs they were manipulative and dishonest willing to do just about anything to accomplish what was in their best interest regardless of the consequences for others if i had to try and pick one it would be oliver in the end was justice actually served was anyone framed who was the real killer were they all guilty in some way with only one paying the ultimate price what happens to noa's memoir at one point i wondered if the story was about the faults in our legal system rather than who committed the murder and why who was the real victim who was being victimized there are so many questions that will rattle your brain until all the pieces come together although you will probably never be able to guess all of the hidden secrets in this novel in the end it may feel a little flat you may find that the mystery was really obvious all along if only you had been looking for the ordinary instead of the extraordinary and more creative ending","100":"listened to this while on a road trip liked it for the most part but it dragged in places and the writing style was over the top with flashy vocabulary and metaphors you may find yourself reading just to find out what happened rather than reading because you're enjoying it","101":"an advanced reader's edition was provided by thereadingroom com and the crown publishing group to me at no cost and with no obligation wow i had low expectations for this book but it blew me away i had little interest in or sympathy for convicted murderer noa p singleton who is awaiting execution when introduced to her but hang on until her victim's mother marlene dixon an uber successful attorney is introduced it quickly becomes obvious that both women are hiding things and the gradual revelations of their secrets drive the plot as we learn more about noa marlene and the circumstances that bring them to confront each other months before noa's execution the reader is completely hooked and desperate to find out exactly what happened and why noa's father is an especially pathetic character and you cannot help wishing things would turn out differently for him spoiler alert the denouement is chilling and heartbreaking one woman takes on too much responsibility and the other not nearly enough gripping stuff from a debut author to watch this reader eager awaits her next novel","102":"intelligent and satisfying...'when i arrived there were fifty one women on death row in the united states all we needed was to drop one to have a proper national beauty pageant or add one if you wanted to include puerto rico and guam 'noa p singleton has been on death row for 10 years and has run out of appeals but then she's never really fought too hard against her sentence anyway - why should she she tells us straight away that she's guilty so when marlene the mother of the victim turns up to say that she's decided the death penalty is wrong and she intends to appeal for clemency noa feels it's pointless especially since what marlene wants most is to know what really happened on the day her daughter sarah died - and noa really isn't willing to go into that but since she doesn't get visitors and since ollie the lawyer marlene has asked to put the appeal together seems like a nice if rather naive young man noa agrees to let him visit the story is told in the form of a memoir noa intends to send to ollie after her death with short passages inset of marlene's letters to her dead daughter we gradually find out about noa's early life and the experiences that have shaped her or do we noa's the first to point out that what people say isn't necessarily the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth the story unfolds slowly leaving plenty of room for noa to digress about the legal system which she does with a biting sarcasm that at points particularly early in the book is wryly funny here's her description of one of the jurors at her trial 'melissa silva thirty six journalist hungry for blood she later wrote a self published memoir about her experience on this case that made it to the top ten thousand books on amazon 'the characterisation of noa is extremely well done leaving the reader never quite sure whether she is the victim of circumstance or an evil killer who deserves to be where she is the plot is interesting and well developed with both strands of the murder and of noa's approaching execution date running in parallel and tension slowly builds towards a satisfying denouement for me there were a couple of weaknesses both things i find often happen in debuts marlene's voice in her letters wasn't sufficiently different from noa's which tends to remind the reader too much that both voices in reality belong to the author also while i enjoyed the writing style and use of language very much occasionally silver falls into the trap of trying to be a bit too clever with her words using vocabulary and descriptions that are a bit too high flown to quite fit but these are minor quibbles over what is overall a very impressive first novel and a satisfying and intelligent mystery i look forward to seeing more from this talented author in the future nb this book was provided for review by the publisher www fictionfanblog wordpress com","103":" noa is a 20 something woman sitting on death row she's visited at the 11th hour by the mother of her victim who has decided to work toward commuting noa's death sentence into life in prison the condition is that noa tells her why she murdered her daughter how the last moments were for her daughter and that's just not something noa is prepared to do you get caught up in noa's story shake your head at her bad luck cling to the hope that there's a light at the end of the tunnel except noa is a bit of an unreliable narrator i didn't see it coming","104":"i was disappointed the story wasn't bad but the language was just precious it felt like an attempt to be a literary thriller but the writing was just forced instead of lovely","105":"interesting twist on how what people do to others and themselves can alter the course of lives perception guilt and a need to control all drive the main characters toward their ends i enjoyed this much more than i expected to","106":"i have come to love a slow burning psychological thriller with unpredictable characters shifting perspectives and a story that devolves miserably which means i should have loved this book told alternately through the diary entries of noa singleton 10 years into her death row sentence for killing the daughter of marlene dixon whose letters to her dead daughter make up the other half of the book both women are keeping secrets not just from each other but from the everyone else who is trying to understand what happened noa's father who was carrying on an affair with the marlene's daughter the young attorneys assigned to noa's defense even the reader is given the project of understanding what went wrong between two attractive young woman such that one ended up dead and the other on death row but in the end the secrets both women harbor are not particularly novel or interesting and the writing was not enough to capture me into the story i kept thinking that this read more like a screenplay than a novel and i might enjoy this as a movie depending on if it took more of a heartfelt prison memoir or a grisham inspired legal thriller approach","107":"one of the most ludicrously overwrought overwritten books of all time pointless bizarre metaphors that do nothing but confuse the reader ridiculous adjectives thrown together as if by some random sentence generator much of it just doesn't make sense her eyes pickpocketed the room what does that mean she describes a lawyer as a surfer but then he turns out to be welsh and effete silver is trying way too hard to be stylish and literary and it just falls so flat i understand this is the author's first novel and she is swinging for the fences pulling out every excess there is its too bad because the premise is actually sound this likely looked very good as a five page manuscript proposal i just hope silver reads some reviews and learns how to be edited","108":"elizabeth silver created an absorbing disturbing and suspenseful novel one that i tore through in just a few days if unreliable narrators make you crazy this is a book to skip otherwise check this out for a finely observed well crafted novel with a lot of interesting details related to life on death row and in philadelphia","109":"loved this book the reader knows quickly what happened discovering the why will keep you turning pages long into the night the execution of noa p singleton is a compulsive quick read silver tells her tale like peeling an onion one layer at a time what exactly happened the day sarah was killed was the shooting intentional was it planned how are the characters connected why won't noa speak in her own defense why won't she speak of the crime at all this is a great book to take to the beach this summer just don't plan on getting anything done once you begin i do wonder how authors u0026amp editors of such great skill make an error describing the university library subject classification scheme you know they have been in libraries before noa suffers a medical emergency in the n's of university library while researching her history paper the author should have used a lc # or at the very least a dewey # silver was a judicial clerk in tx for several years and writes authoritatively on the subject of capital punishment","110":"the execution of noa p singleton was a very slow start for me i enjoyed the character studies of both noa and her nemesis but i was quite content to read a chapter a night for a while then things picked up it became a must keep reading book and ultimately a great read i enjoyed the surprisingly twisty story of the hows and whys of noa p singleton's life and motivations","111":"i just couldn't get into this book i tried but couldn't get very far i'm at the stage of my life where if by page 50 i'm not into it i give up there are too many books it may be just the mood i'm in i don't know but this was not for me","112":"unlikable characters within a convoluted story not good","113":"wow i think i know what my next book club selection will be not a feel good book but wow well written and excellent character development the plot unfolds unpredictably and i definitely want to discuss it highly recommend","114":"a haunting and provocative narrative all of the main characters are complex and convoluted in their motivations and actions and in their complicity to the crime that lands noa on death row often thought provoking occasionally insightful about broader questions regarding our judicial system this novel left me feeling unsettled at its conclusion no tidy ending here","115":" the execution of noa p singleton is a gripping story that leaves the reader with a lot of to contemplate although the protagonist is often unsympathetic the story prods the reader to look not only at her but at the other characters who contribute to the final outcome especially the victim's mother and noa's father both of whom provide the means u0026amp motive for the crime without taking any responsibility for their actions as the details of the crime funfold there are more than a few ironies read this book in three days couldn't put it down that alone makes for a ringing endorsement","116":"this book was haunting in the way it twists the way you look at guilt not only in the criminal justice system but in the soul what appears at first to be story of forgiveness actually becomes a tale of revenge the forgiving victim is actually a remorseless perpetrator of the very crime she seeks justice for never realizing or at least never admitting to herself that she has caused her own pain the purported and convicted murderer a bright but untrusting young woman is complacent about her impending death sentence this first novel is remarkable in its deft storytelling mostly from the point of view of the condemned but also told from the viewpoint of the murdered girl's mother through letters she writes to her dead daughter a young idealistic attorney also figures into the story as the one person without an agenda seeking the truth and actual justice noa the condemned woman is unwilling to trust this man at first and it takes months before she reveals the entire story and even then he is missing critical pieces by the time she has decided to confide in him the mother has dissuaded him from seeing noa again and he never learns the information which may have spared her life","117":"excellent book very suspenseful will be surprised if it's not nominated for an edgar for best first novel read more http litlunchbox com 2013 08 02 gui","118":" this book should not be compared to 'defending jacob ' the only thing the two books have in common is that they describe people committing senseless acts of violence i kept reading this book not because it was that interesting but because it was kind of unique and you could tell that noa was definitely holding things back but i was so disappointed with the final reveal persephone really also the final moments with sarah were too ridiculous to even contemplate this is one of the few times that i disagreed wholly with a glowing ew review they are usually really on point","119":"descriptions of trial are spot on at other times i was just confused","120":" thirty five year old noa is on death row six months prior to her execution x day marlene dixon a high powered attorney and mother of the woman noa was convicted of murdering decides to petition for clemency and has hired a young lawyer oliver stansted to assist in having noa's sentence commuted through a series of flashbacks we learn about noa's childhood her single mother's serial monogamy her friendship with persephone riga her very public miscarriage her reconciliation with her absentee father caleb and the murder of sarah dixon these flashbacks alternate with marlene's letters to her dead daughter noa is not a likeable character she feels alienated and expresses that alienation in a cynical attitude her voice is brusque and unemotional the real problem however is that she doesn't behave as a supposedly intelligent person would she is the salutatorian of her graduating class and is accepted to princeton yet she makes terrible decisions that are illogical for instance her initial involvement with marlene makes little sense during her trial she also refuses to participate in her own defense her passivity may be the result of latent guilt over an incident involving a childhood friend but her motivation is never clarified the development of marlene's character is more interesting than the revelation of noa's background marlene is initially sympathetic she is a grieving mother and cancer survivor gradually however she emerges as a master manipulator who bullies people into doing her will one of the major questions throughout is why marlene is in favour of clemency for her daughter's killer when she spoke in favour of capital punishment at noa's sentencing hearing does she have a hidden agenda there are several possible explanations for her behaviour i e learning the truth of what happened when sarah was killed alleviating her guilt in her daughter's fate or in noa's death sentence but again there is no real clarification of motivation the book examines guilt noa mentions at the beginning that she is guilty of shooting sarah \"i was lucid attentive mentally sound and pumped with a single cup of decaffeinated lemon zinger tea when i pulled the trigger \" although she does not contest her guilt there is a suggestion that there are degrees of guilt in one conversation with oliver noa says \"'everyone's got something to feel guilty about '\" and there is certainly the suggestion that others may bear some responsibility in what happened to sarah and that she may not be the only victim certainly the reader is left to question the appropriateness of noa's punishment the author uses noa as a mouthpiece to express her opinion on capital punishment noa discusses the inequality of the law and judicial system \"the law has created a protected class of individuals people who on the basis of their age or status are more valuable to society if they are killed the party responsible must die a nation that prides itself on equality treats its victims ever so inequitably in ritual some states have gone so far as to codify capital murder applying the sentence of death somewhat less haphazardly aggravating factors they call it like murder can be any more inflamed than well what murder already is \"at one point noa accuses oliver of \"linguistic foreplay \" an apt phrase for that of which the author is occasionally guilty at times there are awkward metaphors which jar \"my hands were cuffed facing each other like confused children outside the principal's office\" and \"my eyes pickpocketed the room\" and \" perfecting the art of the guilt trip is isolating like a termite scuffling up your innards\" and \"even his voice was typecast to match his hairstyle and choice of wardrobe docile as a prostrated ocean\" and \"his moans lubricated the phone lines like a sexually transmitted disease whirls of tornadic subjugation seeped through the little holes of the telephone receiver\" and \" the sun's talons skewering the clouds beneath that elongated stretch through the clouds that beam downward pointing like a strict schoolteacher\" and\" the clumsy excuses of unwilling jurors are melodious sacraments to my dissonant entr'acte \" such affected prose does not work despite its occasional florid overwrought style the book is sufficiently entertaining and does provide food for thought as a companion piece i would recommend burial rites by hannah kent another debut novel which also features a woman awaiting her execution please check out my reader's blog http schatjesshelves blogspot ca and follow me on twitter @dcyakabuski","121":"i would probably give it a 3 5 stars i bought it because it was so highly reviewed in the book store so i had high expectations it's a quick rather suspenseful read about a bright young girl who is on death row and the story of how she got there","122":"about halfway through the book i stopped caring about who was guilty and who was innocent and just wanted to know what happened really well written alternated between present day and flashbacks well and managed to make the convicted murderer more sympathetic than the mother of the murder victim the ending was interesting but not vindicating","123":"the problem with this book is that it has a really really interesting premise but the writing plot and character development aren't strong enough people magazine compared it to gone girl i definitely would not","124":"this is an odd book it jumps around in time from her in jail to before her crime at times it's hard to figure what happens when i'm still not sure i liked it but i'm still thinking about it weeks later","125":"the book was certainly a page turner however something about the characters' motivations didn't quite ring true i don't know could not put my finger on it however there were times when i read something and was like wait why did that happen and how still despite those wonky parts frankly i couldn't put it down","126":"this book was not what i was hoping for it was deeply depressing i was rooting for the main character she had a hard life u0026amp it only got harder as she got older","127":"this is an intriguing story with plenty of twists that kept me turning the pages i enjoyed noa's sarcastic voice and found her to be a believable death row character the book does a good job exploring the psychological motives of all of the character's involved","128":"wish goodreads had half stars would have given this one 3 1 2 it was good slow to start and i almost gave it up but i stuck with it and was surprised by a pretty decent book","129":"it was a pretty decent read i like the fact in this story that i didn't actually like the characters i thought that they were interesting and flawed but not so disgusting that i hated each of them just enough so that they made me uncomfortable","130":"what a book it was so nice to get into a book that i just could not put down it will stay with me for a while the story itself was unique and different i highly recommend it","131":" noa p singleton is thirty five and she has spent the last ten years of her life on death row awaiting execution for the murder of sarah dixon although she has done little to help her own cause she herself says she is guilty and never contested that once there have been many failed appeals on her behalf virtually the only visitors she has ever had are lawyers hoping to get her to agree to get her hopes up yet again now six months before her execution date comes young lawyer oliver standsted who wants to help people and whose social conscience has prompted him to work for the newly formed organisation mothers against death he wants to file a clemency petition on noa's behalf but it soon appears that things are not as simple as they seem because mothers against death has been started by marlene dixon the mother of the victim noa is accused of killing many reviewers have pointed out that to them noa's voice sounds false she is it has to be admitted extremely able to tell her story in an intelligent and reasoned way yet the author makes sure she tells her readers how academically able noa was despite her background i suppose that you either have to feel that noa rings true as a character for you or you don't and if not i do understand that argument personally though i liked noa as a character and i found myself immersed in the story we read of noa's unfolding life largely through her journals which she intends to leave to oliver there are also letters from marlene dixon herself to her daughter sarah which reveal some of her motivations on the book cover this novel is compared to we need to talk about kevin and i think that does this book an injustice for me it did not have that extremely thought provoking what if quality that kevin had a book i loved but was nevertheless a real page turner in many ways it is an old fashioned whodunnit or rather you wonder what noa was really guilty of whether anyone else was involved what marlene dixon's real agenda is and would noa be executed that is not to say that this novel did not open up questions it would undoubtedly make a great book club read but it was less about issues than about the storyline and characters personally i enjoyed it hugely and finished it within a day finding it completely un putdownable a self assured and interesting debut which will stay with me i look forward to reading more by this talented author","132":"interesting book i am not sure that i totally understood it all the way the story was told was very different i didn't love it and not nearly as shocking as gone girl","133":"in her own words as early as page 9 the author elizabeth l silver writes it's like law school trains these junkies to masticate language as if it's gum stick a slice in your mouth chew on it blow it full of hot air and then spit it on the ground when it no longer tastes good ironic really when her own mastication is so self servingly and annoyingly regurgitated throughout this book almost makes me want to rummage through the rubbish bin to retrieve my copy of '50 shades of gray' for a restorative re read","134":" honestly i'm not sure what i thought about this book i was compelled to keep reading even though the narrator was hard to connect to or root for the premise was interesting and i wanted to know the story behind the hints that kept getting dropped i liked that i felt the author left some loose ends for some characters because that's how things actually happen when you're not reading a book i would recommend this but for whatever reason i felt like i got pulled into the hopelessness so i finished it feeling unsatisfied i don't know yet if that's the mark of a great story or my inability to fully commit to it","135":"interesting book twists and turns believable characters","136":" if you knew the day you were going to die would that be a gift or a curse what would you say as your last words what would you want to eat for your last meal would you explain yourself try to tell your story noa is on death row in pennsylvania for murdering sarah on new years day 10 years prior she originally had another story that an intruder did it but after her arrest she gave that up since then she doesn't deny she did it nor does she defend why she did it now she's sitting back counting down her time until x day slowly over the last few months of her life noa p singleton journals her story how she came to be facing her execution her explanation of why she's sitting on death row isn't the result of one incident as with most big important things in our lives it's the culmination of a lot of points but we don't see the whole picture until we've connected all the dots and maybe you'll wonder whether she really should be facing execution the folks in noa's life contribute to who she is and why she does what she does her mom a not so successful wanna be actress her absence from her daughter's life post trial bothered me as a mom as a reader i did want to know a little bit more about why she wasn't there for her same as her brother noa's father has been absent all her life and then shows up soon before sarah's murder he's a shady recovering alcoholic at the end of the book i wondered what happened to him where'd he go noa meets with the mother of her victim who says she now wants to file for her clemency why good question interesting answer she meets with the lawyer who works for the mother and contemplates how much she can and will tell him and when this isn't gory or scary execution and capital murder might make you think it is it's not a who dunnit because you know who did it the story is in what happened and why","137":"elizabeth l silver's the execution of noa p singleton has a great premise thirty five year old noa is on death row for murder with her execution date just six months away when marlene dixon the mother of her victim shows up with a proposal marlene will use her influence to convince the state to commute noa's sentence to life in prison in exchange for information on her daughter's murder why did noa kill sarah what exactly happened on new year's day 2003 noa has never told her story not to the press not to her attorneys and not in court noa can save her own life by revealing the truth behind sarah's death what should she do great premise yes but the novel slogs along in its overwritten prose dragging the reader through noa's self indulgent musings and her meandering metaphors until the actual details of the plot what happened the day sarah died don't really matter silver's novel pretends to be literature rather than a grisham style legal thriller she uses lots of big pretentious words shovels full of metaphors and convoluted sentences that require careful unraveling to make sense and they don't always make sense even with that effort noa who narrates the novel is clearly an educated woman with a fine grasp of language although it's often distracting wading through her clever verbiage and layered parentheticals it's also odd that in spite of her knowledge of grammar and syntax noa has no idea how to use the word cliche she makes the high school mistake of using the noun as an adjective i e it was `cheesy cliche nauseating' if boiled down to its essence noa's story is both intriguing and compelling things happened to her in her childhood during college and in the months before the murder that do explain the death row inmate in 2013 but so much of the story is buried under all the pretentious prose that it loses its impact by the end i also found it impossible to believe that anyone could remember the specifics including words spoken and things done of something that happened when she was ten month's old this little detail becomes important in events that happen to noa later but it stood out to me as jarringly incredible additionally there are italicized letters in this book purportedly written by marlene dixon to her long dead daughter but they sound exactly like noa's first person narration which presumably sounds exactly like elizabeth silver again it was distracting were these supposed letters created by noa who was created by silver the final letter suggests not but marlene and noa use the same convoluted style of expression the same over reliance on metaphor and parentheticals it's frustratingly confusing overall the execution of noa p singleton does deliver a satisfying and believable denouement and the final act makes some sort of odd if convoluted sense but reading this novel is exhausting if lines like it's isolating like a termite scuffling up your innards and my eyes pickpocketed the room are your cup of tea then you might enjoy this novel i on the other hand kept wondering how a scuffling termite in my innards was isolating which tended to get in the way of the story itself this one didn't work for me please note i was provided a copy of this book for review the opinions expressed here are my own","138":"im really losing track of this book now was enjoying it at the beginning but now im not actually sure whats going on in the beginning i really really liked this i was speeding through it but slowly i became more and more confused by it until eventually i had no idea what was going on seriously i would love someone to please explain to me what happened in this book","139":"spellbinding i was glued to this book highly recommended","140":" i finished this book without the sated feeling i normally feel when i finish a well told story i felt perplexed sucker punched confused and ultimately like i needed more a number of hours have passed and i am still befuddled by some of noa's actions and yet they felt then upon first reading and feel now upon further contemplation believable and real her actions appear human elizabeth silver succeeded in creating something truly novel in this story the execution of noa p singleton provides a window into an experience that is deeply foreign an experience most individuals do not even care to contemplate what is it like to be a woman on death row and what events could lead an intelligent woman who is admitted to an ivy league school to find herself on death row additionally why would someone facing death row refuse to help the attorneys trying to defend her the story of noa p singleton feels deeply real because humans are complex and baffling individuals people often say truth is stranger than fiction we live in a world where a troubled young man chose to enter an elementary school and kill 20 sixth graders and 6 adults and another troubled young man hunted down tsa agents we live in a world where a high school student sexually assaulted his teacher and killed her in a school bathroom before dumping her desecrated body in woods behind the school we live in a world where over 11 000 people have been killed by guns since newtown our reality is baffling some will say noa p is a psychopath but i didn't read her that way she went to upenn she lived in philly i have lived both of those experiences she was raised by a mother who told a story that loomed large in her psyche she didn't meet her father until she was eighteen years old she suffered two devastating losses at early ages and was not provided with the necessary guidance to help her make peace with these deeply traumatic experiences i have thankfully not lived those experiences this novel is a story of death row and of murder but it is also a story about dysfunctional parenting it is a story of the events that bring together two dramatically different women noa an intelligent college dropout and marlene dixon a high powered attorney and the mother of noa's victim silver helps the reader to see that noa is not completely evil and marlene is not completely a victim or person deserving of sympathy the theme of agency looms large in their intertwined story but the whole novel seems an artful take on delving deep into the ways the events of our childhood stay with us forever and lead us to particular fates noa had been fed a particular story by her mother for countless years her mother didn't want to own up to dropping her baby so she manufactured a story of a home invasion noa internalized the moral of this story she chooses at thirteen to cover up her own worst act and twelve years later when faced with another dangerous situation she chooses again to embrace creative truth telling after this event she refuses to provide any explanations or stories she spins no new yarns until right before the end when marlene arrives with an assistant proclaiming she is now against the death penalty and wants to help noa in the end noa's explanation is buried and forgiveness and clemency are thrown aside as unworthy goals but the reader is left pondering what is the point of all these machinations and missteps what can be learned from these choices i'm still perplexed even as i sit here trying to make sense of this artfully drawn story why did the author make these particular choices how do we understand the emotions and choices that drive all of the flawed characters in this story i think the execution of noa p singleton is an excellent choice for a book club there is so much in this compelling story worthy of probing and it would be helpful to make sense of this novel with others","141":"i'd rate this 4 5 stars no matter where you stand on the capital punishment debate there's no denying the fact that a number of people sentenced to die for their crimes were actually innocent wound up being convicted because of incompetent representation or there was far more behind what they did than their court cases might have divulged while elizabeth l silver's riveting the execution of noa p singleton doesn't truly approach capital punishment from these angles these questions do come up noa singleton is a convicted murderer sentenced to death in a capital murder case she doesn't deny what she did she didn't testify on her own behalf during her trial didn't offer much information to her attorneys during the laborious appeals process and has essentially resigned herself to her fate six months before her scheduled execution she is visited by oliver an eager young lawyer representing a nonprofit organization mothers against death and they are committed to blocking noa's execution surprisingly this nonprofit is headed by high powered attorney marlene dixon who happens to be the mother of the woman noa was convicted of killing marlene tells noa she has changed her mind about the death penalty and noa's sentence and will do everything she can to convince the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison but what marlene wants is answers why did noa kill her daughter what is her story for someone conditioned through a tumultuous life somewhat of her own making not to trust anyone and someone whose true secrets have remained so for too long noa at first doubts oliver and marlene's motivations but as she begins her recounting of her life and the events that led up to the murder you begin to wonder who was truly at fault for noa's turning out the way she did was there more to the murder and the trial then meets the eye and like noa you begin to wonder whether marlene truly represents her last chance at avoiding death if she were to want to in the first place some of what unfolds in this book is surprising some not so much if you've watched any episode of the law and order franchise but that doesn't make the book less compelling or noa's character more mercurial you can't figure out whether to feel sorry for her or loathe her for her actions until everything is divulged and even then you're still not 100 percent sure how you should feel while the execution of noa p singleton has the makings of a great beach read especially for fans of legal thrillers it's far more than that it's the story of a woman buffeted by circumstances beyond her control yet who chooses to cede control when she shouldn't this is a good one","142":"enjoyable read liked how the story unfolds and the pieces are revealed but a somewhat unsatisfying ending","143":"i don't read a lot of suspense novels because i tend to find them too manipulative for my tastes i gave this one a try because it's been getting a lot of good reviews and because the premise was fascinating to me noa p singleton is on death row for the murder of a young wealthy woman her victim's mother a high powered attorney has a change of heart and has decided to seek clemency for noa as the story unspools it becomes clear that nothing is as it seems we learn about noa's difficult past and the events that brought her to sarah dixon's apartment on new year's day 2003 is noa a cold blooded murderer is she a victim of her troubled childhood was the murder a crime of jealousy or a gross misunderstanding silver includes plenty of twists in noa's tale but she avoids the obvious which i appreciated the nonlinear timeline led to a slow reveal of the hows and whys behind sarah dixon's death and the reasons why noa faces her own death with resignation and sad dignity","144":"really enjoyed this book had a very interesting twist","145":"this was gripping read that i really enjoyed it's the story of noa who is convicted of murder and sentenced to the death penalty yet refuses to defend herself or explain deeply thoughtful revealing noa's story like the layers of an onion the story surprised and entertained","146":"3 5 stars a great pick for bookclubs","147":"interesting plot terribly depressing","148":"i read the entire book but almost didn't writing was okay but nothing spectacular can't give a reason why but i was disappointed","149":" this is possibly the best book i've read in a while and i read a lot noa is on death row charged with the murder of a young girl she has run out of appeals and has 6 months to x day a new attorney comes to visit sent by a senior partner who feels he can gain her clemency noa writes it off as another young punk looking to make his mark until she finds out the senior partner who sent him is none other than her victim's mother we follow noa along as she relates her past to this new attorney as we glimpse what life has been like and become acquainted with her family and friends this story will keep you reading and dropping your jaw as twist after twist is revealed","150":"the execution of noa singleton is a very unique novel the first half was very cold and slow going for me in the beginning the character of noa is little known and on death row facts leak out over time about the fateful day that landed her in prison she had very flighty parents who were fairly abusive but she excelled in school noa seems interested in fights for her appeal but you never know where she is coming from as she seems to have accepted her fate noa is in prison for murder and on death row but the woman who helped put her there the victim's mother has started an organization called mad created to keep people from the death penalty and she appears to want to help noa escape death most of the characters for the first half of the book were cold and distant ollie a young british man who is a green lawyer is hired by mad to help noa get off death row this is a book where things aren't always as they seem noa came to life for me in the second half of the book as the story unfolds in the beginning i could have cared less about any of the people in the story seriously i wanted to just finish the book but as the story progressed it got more and more interesting and i quickly read the second half but this is a dark tale no holds barred i can't remember the last time i read a book where none of the characters were of any interest to me but half way had the book perk up to the point i finished it in one sitting when the first half took about a week i have read books that were slow in the first half but in this i didn't even care what happened to the people in the beginning but when things start to fall into place the story is very intriguing of interest in this book as well are stories of notable death row inmates noa shares last words of other killers on death row and their last meals as well in a morbid way this was kind of fascinating as i've never really looked into the subject tidbits revealed from her trial were also very culturally accurate with lawyers spinning their side and witnesses attesting to minute details that become important when someone is put on trial this part seemed very real and well done all in all this was a very different book dark with very little humor and no light about a woman on death row who may or may not be the culprit","151":"i did enjoy the twist at the ending but i struggle with books in which i have no feeling for the main character i understand that that was basically the point but it is still tough for me to really love a book when that is the case","152":"i enjoyed the execution of noa p singleton right from the start it is a wonderfully written intriguing novel that you do not want to put down elizabeth silver does a fantastic job of developing characters that you want to understand even though they are naturally flawed the book is able to integrate elements of crime and the law in a thought provoking literary novel a definite must read","153":"noa is on death row and has a chance at clemency this book is her flashing back and recounting the crime for quite a while you don't know what she was accused of and for even longer you don't know if she is guilty or innocent perhaps that is what kept me reading i didn't find any of the characters appealing and it seemed to drag at times but i did enjoy the writing","154":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here at first i found the book interesting i liked the use of two narrators both of whom are unreliable and the introspection of viewing one's life i kind of liked the memento like revealing of facts an element at a time spoilers ahead what i did not like was the lack of explanation of the change in noa's character some have referred to her pitiful childhood but this has to be based on a superficial understanding based on noa's superficial view of her past life the facts show that her y at first i found the book interesting i liked the use of two narrators both of whom are unreliable and the introspection of viewing one's life i kind of liked the memento like revealing of facts an element at a time spoilers ahead what i did not like was the lack of explanation of the change in noa's character some have referred to her pitiful childhood but this has to be based on a superficial understanding based on noa's superficial view of her past life the facts show that her young life despite a weird mother had alot going for it she did well in school had a hot boyfriend got a scholarship to college her miscarriage and surgery during freshman year would have been traumatic but i don't understand why they were life ending for noa i don't see why she did not return to school second semester and make something of her life the prolonged aimlessness of someone who had experienced such success just did not make sense further no insight was given into why noa would be so entirely uncooperative with her defense the fact that she requested an attorney at the start of the interrogation and was denied plus the length of the interrogation with no food or bathroom breaks should have been enough to take the death penalty off the table further the whole presence of marlene did not make sense it is inexplicable why noa would protect her to the very end after all those years why should would found mad and make a sham of using ollie to get some statements from noa does not make sense ending the book with the review of the unsubmitted clemency package was just so unsatisfying the book just leaves an empty soulless impression a book of failed promise more","155":"i found this book to be pretentious with unlikable characters and motivations that didn't ring true for me i don't have to love the protagonist to like a book but the motivations have to connect in some way and in this book they just didn't","156":"would have given it a half star if it was possible didn't finish it","157":"this is by far one of the best books i've read in months really compelling couldn't put it down does noa deserve execution you let me know after you read the book can't say more for fear of being a spoiler absolutely lives up to its reviews","158":"well written in the fact that a novel with virtually no plot kept me interested ending is a let down however","159":"with an author that has a theatrical flair for metaphors probably drags this story down but it works as the story progresses and turns into noa's persona i liked this book a lot as disturbing as it was","160":"3 5 the story is interesting but the author uses overly cumbersome text throughout the book which i found a little annoying","161":" 3 0 out of 5 stars what is truth what is justice convoluted story by unreliable narrators pulls this novel along albeit cumbersomely as it twists in many directions toward a fairly unsatisfying conclusion given my intense and immediate lack of empathy for the characters in this book i found it hard to care too much about noa's situation and her mixed up tale of lackluster achievement and her missed potential her dashed dreams partially formed hopes and going nowhere life before her imprisonment was mostly of her own making and the reasons for this are only partially explained and examined in the chapters counting down to her x or execution day the other characters in the book are not so well drawn with only tantalizing glimpses into the psyche of marlene dixon who as an attorney and the mother of sarah the woman killed by noa and the reason why noa is on death row is a bit more understandable as her grief warps her perspective and sets her on a mission the narrative weaves back and forth in time and is repetitive in places and suspicious in others is noa telling the truth about anything that has happened in her past or have the 10 years of solitary imprisonment warped her memories so that they are shrouded in veils that obscure and smooth those things that she might not want to remember accurately out of pain formed by guilt noa recounts her childhood in bits and pieces reflecting on her theatrical and emotionally absent mother and her abandonment by a father she never knew but had recently reconnected with how have her experiences shaped the person she is now marking off her last days at almost the last hour noa is given a spark of hope when marlene dixon announces that in a change of heart she no longer wants noa to be executed for killing her daughter and sends a young attorney to noa to help prepare a case for clemency only wanting to know why noa killed sarah since noa never took the stand at her trial or gave a motive it was all speculation circumstantial evidence and questionable testimony will marlene get the answers she needs because after all those reasons won't bring her sarah back to her ultimately the question of expiation for wrongs committed and hope for the ultimate gift of forgiveness are main themes but what are exactly the crime s for which noa bears the sentence is she redeemed i usually like dramas of this nature but much of it required too much suspension of disbelief at the coincidental nature of the relationships between the characters and the parts portrayed sometimes i liked the writing at others i found it tedious and ambiguous so that it was meandering all around the truth i prefer a conclusion that answers my questions quells my doubts and allows me to interpret a mystery or get to the heart of the matter i realize there is a moral argument regarding the death penalty but even more so there certainly is sometimes difficulty in seeing where execution is equated with justice i'm not meant here to argue the morality or legality of capital punishment and readers will come to this with their own positions on the matter at the end the only question is did noa deserve her sentence and how did her punishment change anything that had happened were the mitigating circumstances worthy of consideration even at the conclusion there are loose ends that's why this book would work great for a discussion group thank you to blogging for books for this free paperback to review","162":" i found this book to be very disappointing ew compared this to gone girl and gave it an a minus the book really failed to live up to those expectations what works for it and against it is that it is incredibly short 308 pages with about 20 pages of filler before chapters for this reason i felt the book lacked character development or proper plot development however where i normally would not have finished this book i was able to read it in about a week the author did manage to say several interesting things about the death penalty and the dominant role parents play in their children's lives in the end for me this book just lacked the spark to make it great i think the author has a much more compelling book in her future","163":"wait what happened now i would give this book 2 5 stars because it was okay and kept me interested even though i can't quite explain what i just read is this a book about the death penalty forgiveness a mentally unstable individual mother seeking answers i couldn't tell you the readers in the audiobook version did a fine job though so i'll round up","164":"i think it was a tough book to finish review to follow","165":" wow this is one of those books that i know i will have trouble getting out of my mind i can't stop thinking about it the characters and what the truth really is about blame and about the stories people convince themselves are true in order to feel better about things they have done i can't decide how i feel about any of it where were the problems here with noa's mom who taught her to lie rather than face any trouble the truth may or may not bring with sarah's mom who was so over involved in how she thought sarah should live her life that she never considered the ensuing consequences from her attempts to steer things where she wanted them to go and who used her influence on everyone to get what she wanted so that in the end she never actually got what she wanted as she may have if she just let things play out with a father lover with too many mistakes in his past to avoid blackmail with psychology a childhood trauma forced to bear alone or the loss of a child with no support with noa herself just intrinsically with the judicial system in the us so many places to put blame and in the long run where is the right where is the justice o my gosh this was an amazing debut the only thing i didn't like was the ending i don t know why i was not surprised that sarah's mom never passed on the items noa sent her since that was her m o from the beginning but it just left a very unsavory feeling in my mouth maybe that was the point in which case bravo author bravo this book nailed it","166":"i expected to like this book much more than i actually did the characters are mainly unlikable and i never felt invested in their story the author's use of awkward similes was excessive nonsensical and laughable i do not recommend this novel","167":"i signed up to win this book with an obligation to write a lengthy review upon completion if i hadn't agreed to do so i might not have finished this book even though i have almost never abandoned a book in my life maybe it was so bad because i received an uncorrected proof maybe it ended up being improved after corrections were made although i doubt it some of the sentences this author put together were so indescribably atrocious they would stop me in my tracks","168":"eehhhh strange read and awful ending","169":"this book started out kind of slow and i kept thinking for about the first 100 pages why don't i like this more than i do it does eventually get good but it never actually qualified as a page turner for me i liked the unpredictablility of the plot and some strong characters but there was something not quite riveting about it i did enjoy it but didn't love it","170":" i gave this novel five stars because i know that the book and noa will stay with me for the rest of my life the author crafted this book to allow the reader to discover the real noa and the evil witch marlene in his or her own good time i was surprised humored and moved by the entire story from start to finish the novel is also an indictment of our legal system parenting or lack thereof law enforcement and our current non compassionate culture in general great read that will stay with you for years to come","171":"i'd really give this 2 5 stars it held my attention and kept me wanting to know what happened but the resolution was disappointing ultimately and the main character was so supremely unlikeable and apparently unreedeemable","172":"this gentle reader is not an easy read and yet it is so worthwhile the author understands the concept that not everything needs to be spelled out to the reader and that of itself is a rare talent perhaps like marlene dixon we would like clearcut answers and confessions but i believe the author expects us to think about her characters and to consider their actions unlike more conventional fiction this novel is somewhat opaque it's not clear cut people are not perfect and just because death becomes a close companion it does not mean that clarity is forthcoming or that all ills are healed i look forward with some fear to elizabeth l singleton's next novel i hope she will be able to match her first novel i can only hope","173":"couldn't put it down","174":"an original and compelling story","175":"unusually plotted which is annoying but undeniably compelling at first i disliked noa's narration but became accustomed to her voice as i read on i won't spoil the ending but it was effective standout characterization of noa's father caleb and the unforgettable marlena dixon","176":"a dark at times wildly melodramatic story filled with generally unlikable characters and a somewhat implausible storyline still it kept me engaged til the end and for a debut book it's impressive","177":"really intriguing premise but as the story progressed i found myself increasingly frustrated with the actions and decisions of noa to me i still don't see a legitimate reason for the choices she made and the course that set her on it's a compelling read though and i like the dual perspectives of noa and marlene the audio managed to keep my interest the whole way through so a good choice for listening","178":" this book was not what i expected but not necessarily in a bad way i assumed it would focus on the clemency appeal and the workings of the legal system like a grittier jodi picoult but instead it slowly unraveled the story of noa p singleton it was a good sized book but was engaging enough to be a fast read i found myself not sympathising with noa but still genuinely liking her she was straightforward about her motivations and never attempted to claim a romanticised version of events which i respected the plot didn't rely on shocking twists yet still managed to surprise me this book was a good reminder that there's often more to a story than the police and lawyers can uncover","179":"great story and well written i found it hard to put down","180":"so disappointing i read the ew review which gave it an a and compared it to gone girl so i ploughed through the tortured prose and overwrought red herrings for very little payback not a page turner no characters to root for there are way better mysteries coming of age stories skip this","181":" likeable for those who like this genre not for general audiencesimilar to gone girl unreliable first person s who tells us a lot while hiding til later the crucial bits two major narrators who completely oppose each other limited amount of time to figure out what really happened it's the few months before her execution in this case we have a smart talented girl who never went anywhere as a woman half a semester at college etc and is revealed pretty soon to be a known liar and the ultimate career woman without a heart a few blips on the reality if you don't want to treat it as 'unreliable narrator' then it might bother you neither of the two main characters is likeable","182":"loved this book its sad and frustrating but delves into the right or wrong of the death penalty","183":"great book mainly because it was so different as the reviews say noa didn't testify at her trial or help with her defense and the book kept me guessing until near the end as to why when it was revealed as to why she had chosen to keep quiet about many things i was actually surprised even though i thought i had it figured out this was a very interesting read especially because of the author's writing style which really drew me in i've read several reviews of this book and those reviews have varied widely but i really liked it and wasn't disappointed at all","184":" this is an odd one i might put it more at 2 5 stars the story itself was actually pretty good with a twist that i didn't see coming however the writing the editing was there any there were so many clunky sentences that it was distracting metaphors that made no sense honestly it had to be one of the most poorly edited books i have read such a shame i found myself so focused on the bad writing that it was hard to get through it ultimately i'm glad i did because of the story but i don't know if i could honestly recommend it","185":"the first recent read for my unreliable narrator shelf hope i get around to adding other better books to this category this one was ok but kind of boring in parts i thought i would just breeze through it without putting it down but it was quite put down able","186":"first lines'in this world you are either good or evil if not then a court or a teacher or a parent is bound to tag your identity before you've had a chance to figure it out on your own 'the plotessentially this book is noa p singleton's memoir written whilst on death row she starts to pen her story with six months left until her execution date after marlene dixon the mother of noa's victim initiates contact with her interspersed with noa's story of how she ended up committing her crime letters from marlene to her deceased daughter sarah feature the charactersnoa the main character seriously grated on me her narrative is filled with sarcasm and attitude the kind of personality you might stumble upon when reading a book narrated by a teenager perhaps not a thirty five year old woman i understand she has been in prison for the past ten years and that people change whilst in prison but this is the same way noa acted before she committed her crime i could have overlooked my dislike of her personality had she not been the narrator another character instrumental in this novel is marlene dixon to say she is a nasty piece of work doesn't even cut it manipulative and selfish right until the very end i dislike marlene but she is very well written as a character it's not nice to think that there are people like her in this world but there are she is a reality even if a rare one i'm not entirely sure if the audience were suppose to like noa whether she was suppose to be redeeming or not if how i feel about her is how elizabeth l silver intended for the readers to feel about her but i don't think it is i think we are supposed to find her redeeming by the time we reach the end but i still didn't like her i could be wrong on this point but it's just the impression i got the writingelizabeth l silver crafted a mysterious story that didn't fail at keeping me page turning i wanted to know exactly how and why sarah met her fateful end something that is slowly peeled away for us layer by layer i liked silver's writing i was definitely intrigued and would like to see future works from her but i did have one gripe with her writing style the over usage of metaphors and large complex words when they weren't necessary simple words would have sufficed just as well final thoughtsi would recommend the execution of noa p singleton if plot is the most important element for you when reading for more reviews be sure to visit my blog http www lifesopenpages blogspot co uk","187":"it was a decent book fast read and a touch predictable but enjoyable","188":"i wanted to like this book more but couldn't it was well written and the plot made you want to read more to learn what happens but the characters deserved little empathy and were difficult to like like in a scary movie there were times when i wanted to yell at the characters to do something take action","189":"dark and twisty read with no winners in the end","190":"i enjoyed noa's voice and story tough smart heartbreaking the conclusion was not as satisfactory as i would have liked but perhaps more real the way it is","191":"an excellent read interesting information about the death penalty this is a book i'll think about for a while","192":"disappointing silver couldn't make me care about any of the characters the writing was a bit disjointed confusing and awkward at times","193":"wow what a first person account exceptionally written very descriptive almost frighteningly so a sad story allround however because the main character is forthwith and unabashed about her self her life and all the events it is at some times humorous in a distorted sort of way definitely recommended reading","194":" sigh i really wanted to like this book more since it came highly recommended by another book club member the premise was interesting noa is a woman on death row for killing another woman sarah months before the execution date sarah's mother starts to visit noa presumably with the idea to help noa receive clemency told through lots of flashbacks the story of how noa comes to be on death row is revealed my main problem with the book is that none of the characters are particularly believable and their actions just don't ring true i just found myself becoming irritated with everyone and really didn't care how the book ended it will be interesting to see what others in the club think about the book","195":"noa is on death row counting down days until her execution a page turner for sure why is she there why didn't she defend herself the ending was a little frustrating but worth the read","196":"some interesting twists and turns it definitely kept me reading nothing to write home about but it is an entertaining read","197":"wow what a great first novel for this author a great story about a young girl growing up with an over the top mother and an absent father and how everything that happens affects her entire life also loved the comparison with another young girl that had an entirely different upbringing would recommend this to just about everyone excited to see what this authorncomes up with next","198":"i read every day i am very tough on books i expect to be swept into the writing by the third page at the latest i would rate elizabeth silver as highly skilled she has taken a truly novel approach to this book she keeps you trying to second guess the troubled minds of 2 sets of disfunctional mother daughter relationships through letters slices of time and key events and relevant dialogue the book is a fast read first person narrative there are no wasted asides or filler i disliked every character and still turned the pages quickly there were times i was frightened the story would get away from silver and become unbelievable trash not the case this book is gritty frustrating and a good piece to share discussion with friends","199":"this book was exceptional a very unique plot with incredibly witty and captivating characters noa is extraordinary her personality and wit adding a humorous element to an otherwise melancholic story the timeline can get a little confusing now and then but after the first several chapters one gets used to it jumping from past to present i found all of the characters to be real for lack of a better word which made them easy to relate to don't pick a side until you've finished the book","200":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this story up until the last sentence of chapter 27 before this point i enjoyed the writing style and how little the author was revealing about the actual events that transpired on that evening after that point i was just annoyed by the events as they unfolded i don't think that there was any justification for her keeping quiet about the true events that night she was not the only guilty one in the matter and the actions of other people that led to sarah's death should have also i liked this story up until the last sentence of chapter 27 before this point i enjoyed the writing style and how little the author was revealing about the actual events that transpired on that evening after that point i was just annoyed by the events as they unfolded i don't think that there was any justification for her keeping quiet about the true events that night she was not the only guilty one in the matter and the actions of other people that led to sarah's death should have also been exposed but here are some things that i had a great deal of difficulty accepting noa somehow remembered events from when she was 10 months old it is extremely rare that anyone remembers events before the age of four but here noa has a complete memory of an entire scene from when she is less than a year old and right after she was dropped probably hitting her head i think that it would be impossible for anyone that young to remember events much less ascribe to them any sort of meaning 10 month old kids don't really have an idea of what is going on around them why did her mother act like the authorities thought she was trying to murder her baby i feel like there would have to be more of a back story behind this other than the memory of a friend being convicted of murder after she accidentally hit her kid in the head with a frying pan accidents happen not everyone thinks you are trying to murder your toddler if they fall down the stairs the above event influenced how she reacted in any scary situation instead of calling 911 when she accidentally shot her friend persephone or discovered an unconscious sarah she tries to imitate a burglary and runs away as an adult human how has she not recognized that this is not a good response speaking of persephone why would she know the combinations to all of the safes in the house yes she lived there but guns are typically kept locked up to keep kids out there is no way a responsible parent would have given her the combination to a safe that contained loaded guns also why was an antique gun loaded noa never speaks about marlene's involvement in the case why she owed her no loyalty and she should have come clean about what happened noa dies by lethal injection but why why does she protect her father their relationship is so strange she hates him but loves him enough to protect him from any legal penalties of drugging his pregnant girlfriend which is absurd he should have faced the consequences of his actions just as she was doing for hers marlene dixon she was painted as the villain but it seems like a reader made the comment that she was too strong of an evil force so the author gave her cancer to make her more likeable marlene had very few redeeming qualities and the letters she writes to her daughter that are interwoven with the story are a bit much considering that the two were not very close in real life more","201":"i actually didn't finish this because i really disliked it","202":"i enjoyed the last half of the book better than the first half it took longer than usual for me to get interested in this book it was a sad story because noa did not deserve the sentence she received then again she did not try to defend herself at all her victim's mother was vindictive and spent the rest of noa's life making sure she did not forget what she did then you find out the victim's mother was more involved than expected it was a decent story but i think it was too long","203":"good one to recommend as a gone girl read a like though not quite as dark and twisty","204":"during her capital murder trial noa p singleton refused to speak in her own defense or to allow anyone to speak in her defense during the sentencing phase as a result the jury found her guilty of first degree murder and sentenced noa to death now six months before her execution date she receives a surprise visit from marlene dixon a philadelphia attorney who is also the mother of the pregnant woman noa killed marlene says that she has changed her mind about the death penalty and will try to get noa's sentence commuted to life imprisonment in return for noa telling her why she killed her daughter although i disliked virtually all of the characters if there was ever a book that makes readers face the reality of dealing with the consequences of actions this is the book","205":"really hard to get through disliked the writing style there were too many confusing similes and metaphors","206":"sounds good hope it is","207":" it took me a long time to get into this book but every time i logged on to goodreads i would be reminded it was still there waiting for me to finish it i am very glad i picked it up again this is a mystery on many levels did noa really murder sarah why didn't she say anything in her own defense during her trial did sarah's mother really change her opinion of the death penalty did the fact that her father was absent unknown to noa during childhood play a role in the events what does the p in her name stand for some of these questions remain at the end of the book but enough are answered for the reader to be satisfied but the most important questions all begin with why why did noa say nothing in her own defense why is she so determined not to satisfy sarah's mother's curiosity about the event why did noa lie why did she drop out of penn those questions remain largely unanswered and that is the strength of the book because we don't get those answers from noa we end up asking similar ones about our own lives those questions raise thoughts of own own guilt our own family relationships as well as our relationships with others those questions bring up thouhts of what we might have done differently for those reasons this book will stay with me for at least as long as the 450 some days it took me to finish reading it","208":" i like books with a different twist and this novel has an excellent premise it starts with you knowing the main character is guilty and will be executed noa did not help in her defense or her appeals and as you read the book the story slowly releases details of the crime all of the characters were dysfunctional and i disliked all of them but at the end i had an aha moment as i finally 'got it' the story held my interest knowing that 'all will be revealed' and was much more interesting and surprising than i would have thought this is a debut novel and i look forward to more from this author","209":"noa p singleton the p doesn't stand for anything she says which may not be true has been on death row for ten years and her x date is 6 months away seemingly out of nowhere the mother of the girl that noa shot shows up at the prison telling noa that she no longer believes in execution over the next few months noa's story slowly comes out why did she shoot a girl she barely knew why didn't she do a thing to defend herself in court why doesn't she care about dying what does guilt really mean there are other layers to the story and in the end not every character is as innocent or as guilty as they seem noa is sarcastic sharp and funny while also cold and untruthful at times she is a character to feel sympathy for but at the same time a victim of her own actions i appreciated that this was not a story of wrongful imprisonment of an innocent good person or a heart broken wronged mother it was complicated and messy touching on issues of right and wrong ad execution versus life in prison without making definitive judgement","210":"noa made me so angry how do you expect me to like a character and want to fight for them when they're such an indifferent idiot ugh","211":" i'm a bit torn but i can't give this more than two stars the author does a good job propelling things along and keeping it interesting but here's my issues poor sentence structure in a number of places on a few occasions to the point of being nearly impenetrable very bad similes and metaphors some of which just don't make word sense or are almost comically overblown factual issues good example in a pivotal scene a gun is dropped on a bed the word dropped is used and a description of the gun is then given lying by itself on the bed and then it's suddenly in people's hands again there are far too many of these problems with segues and lack of important exposition which is a real issue because the author does a lot of hopping around and is not doing nearly enough to help us keep trackon top of that the motivation of the main character just doesn't hold water given what's been presented but i'm torn because i had this sense throughout that these things weren't so much the author's fault as her editor's fault she's a first time writer she can be a good writer i think with more seasoning and i want her to keep trying but someone needed to take a hammer to her and say look clean these things up i could have lived with the problems i had with the ending if i hadn't had to deal with the rest all along the way felt like this was a second draft and i wanted to read the fourth or fifth draft or do people not work that hard at novels anymore it's not a complete waste of time i won't agree with the reviewers that have said that a lot of it is very interesting and there's a good story in here if all the characters were a bit more fleshed out i have this sense she was trying harder to keep us guessing than was worth it at a price in terms of getting into the characters but if you read this review you're going to have a hard time enjoying it because you're going to notice these things all the way along and you're also going to know that the big secret isn't really much of a payoff at the end p s i honestly thought a number of times along the way are these expositional issues here on purpose am i going to realize at the end that our narrator is a liar and that's why there are factual errors i couldn't honestly believe they wouldn't have been beaten out of this book by basic editing work","212":"i didn't find this novel to be particularly interesting or well written i only muddled through it to find out the real circumstances that landed noa the main character on death row none of the characters were likable and the story dragged on i wish now that i just skipped ahead and peaked at the ending","213":" not sure what i think of this book i read it because the author is speaking on monday and i'm to close the program i didn't find it a page turner until the last fifty or so pages maybe usually i don't mind if the main character is likeable or not but normally that is because there is some other factor that makes the unlikeableness unimportant not sure i ever found that element here the book it most reminds me of is gone girl i'd probably say noa and amy were similar but the voice of amy's husband was what made me not throw gg across the room i felt like emps was overwritten or maybe it was more that she stretched a metaphor a bit too much i might have accepted that as noa's voice yet another character sounded very much like her that could have been the point yet i'm not sure it was","214":"i'm not sure what to say about this book mainly because i'm not sure how it made me feel the premise of the story was interesting and it was somewhat engaging at times i did finish it and i don't do that with books i can't stand noa p singleton is on death row for a crime she committed ten years ago there is a chance of her being granted clemency and that is the plot here the story is a series of memories and flashbacks that are i think intended to help the reader to get to know noa and figure out what led to the crime the feeling of dissatisfaction i was left with comes from the fact that i never did feel like i got to know her or understand her the same is true of all of the other characters as well i can't figure them out also not one character in the whole mess that i cared about at all the writing of ms silver was a bit heavy handed see some of the reviews below to get a feel for her overuse of bad metaphors for i agree completely and couldn't have said it any better than some of my fellow reviewers i'm not sure what i missed that others who rated it higher must have seen i would officially say that it is just okay i don't think that i could in good conscious recommend this book","215":" this is a very well written story about a young woman who has shot and killed another young woman who is on death row for her crime the story takes place over the last six months before her scheduled execution and extensively tells her backstory as well as that for other characters while some elements of the story do not ring true hard to believe that someone who faints miscarries and bleeds on a university library carpet in the stacks would be remembered extensively for this but what rings very true are the death row descriptions callousness and despair the story is a page turner with lyrical language such as three months later my mother married she was pregnant again and determined not to lose this one to another woman five years her junior it will be interesting to read more works by this author","216":"started off well but dragged in the middle i guess the ending was supposed to be a surprise twist but it just came out of nowhere and didn't make sense to me disappointing","217":"read in a day a book where i struggled if i should like the main character or feel bad for her does she deserve to die it may not be so cut and dry","218":"good choice for fans of last summer's big hit gone girl","219":" i only finished it because i hadn't picked up my next batch of books at the library this book had no emotion whatsoever i really didn't care about any character wasn't surprised by the plot twist because i didn't care and was thoroughly disappointed to realize that nothing actually happens in 300 odd pages despite all the overwrought prose and prettied up writing i really don't know what the point was saw a blurb where this is compared to lionel shriver this is not surprising as i haven't really liked anything ive read by her either this one completely missed the mark with me thumbs down","220":"loved this book about a woman on death row who was herself a victim through guilt and circumstance","221":"great book with a lot of interesting and unpredictable twists","222":"while noa awaits execution her victim's mother attempts to overturn the death sentence guilt and responsibility are heavy themes","223":"noa is sitting on death row with months to be executed the entire novel with a few execptions is told from her perspective she is reluctantly sharing her story of what brought her to the place in her life that she is facing silver's writing is easy fast paced and revealing","224":"who are these a holes it must not be easy to make all the characters so unlikeable i hung in there to find out the secrets but found the denouement pretty unlikely","225":"a good book that moves along like a great mystery at some points and drags like winter in others it is a mostly enjoyable read but not a very satisfying ending","226":"i deeply enjoyed the main character's development the diction of the author allowed you to experience the words and feel as though the characters were real almost every chapter dropped some new detail on you left you sitting there thinking to yourself what in the hell a true page turner but the details of the book and the plot it surrounds is exhausting almost over stimulating at times due to its deep level of suspense great read for one of those dreary rainy days","227":"one of those books that leave you feeling a little icky almost put down in the middle","228":"i won this book from rif thank you rif i was so anxious to read it and i was not disappointed absolutely beautifully written from the very beginning you want to know why why did she do why why does she seem not remorseful why why why it was like watching a movie it is intense and captivating definitely a hit","229":"this one definitely kept me turning the pages and forming various theories as i went along in the end you get the answers but i was left feeling somehow unsatisfied but maybe that's the point an excellent first novel","230":"this is one whale of a book but at times difficult to follow i think this is how it goes noa p persophoneus singleton sits on death row in pennsylvania for the murder of a 30 something year old female who was pregnant by noa's 50 something year old father who has been in and out of numerous prisons and noa's appeal is being handled by the victim's mother and another attorney named oliver who is from england gotcha roped in yet yeah that's right the victim's mother is her attorney for her appeal the author who has worked as a judicial clerk in the texas dept of criminal appeals does an excellent job of enlightening the readers as to the brutal stark reality of life for a death row prisoner even one resigned to her fate as singleton is frank","231":"i was a bit disappointed in this book i never really cared about any of the characters and the plot wasn't particularly believable part of the problem is the way the publisher over hypes it based on the advance comments you are led to expect something special and while this is a perfectly readable book it just wasn't that special","232":"an extraordinary read that blurs the lines between guilt innocence responsibility and reason can there ever be a satisfying answer to the question why","233":" possible spoiler i'm not quite sure how i feel about this story the ending anyway it was very well written i found myself wanting to know more and more about noa's past noa is a reliable narrator as she is awaiting her execution date i fought the urge to skip to the end to see if something happens that changes her current situation then i got to the end of the book seriously a diamond tennis bracelet that's what marlene gets for her part that's all on with daily life some internal sadness ohh wahhh her guilt and a diamond tennis bracelet first gone girl and now this i'm not liking this trend","234":"exceptional storytelling great technical slow reveal of mystery but by end i was annoyed with all the characters and just can't recommend it","235":"the story was slow at first but worth the read conflicting feeling on each character mix of details and secrets i liked it","236":" i liked this book but there were a few things that bugged me the language was a bit over the top...i consider myself to be relatively smart but you definitely needed to read carefully noa seemed a little flat to me it killed me that spoiler alert she refused to testify in her defense especially considering the consequences i don't care how guilty you may feel about something if you didn't do it you have to stand up for yourself it was like she'd already given up i didn't like how it ended with noa and i didn't like that ollie just disappeared he seemed way too vested in noa to just leave when marlene told him to go but aside from these things this was an interesting premise and a good story","237":" i'm just on a weird streak with books right now books that i don't hate but i certainly can't say that i liked them either noa p singleton has been on death row for 10 years for killing sara dixon six months before her execution date she's approached by a lawyer oliver who says he has been sent there by an organization mothers against death or mad to file for clemency on her behalf it turns out that mad was started by none other than marlene dixon sara dixon's mother all marlene wants is answers what happened that day why did noa kill sara the biggest problem i had with this book was that none of the decisions any of the characters made were in the least bit logical i couldn't understand one single decision that anyone made noa refuses to participate in her own defense at all she refuses to give her side of the story not to the police not to her own lawyers not to the jury no one in pennsylvania there are only certain factors that will make a person eligible for the death penalty there may or may not have been reasons that she was genuinely eligible but she refused to say anything one way or the other who does that there were other people involved but she decided not to bring that up not because she cared about these people or they were family or friends they weren't for no reason she just decided not to name them and how much of what we learned about noa was true i have no idea perhaps her reluctance to put up a defense stemmed from latent guilt from something that occurred when she was 12 ooookkk how does that make sense if she had never been arrested for killing sarah would she have never made amends for the other incident almost everyone in this story was terrible every single person was selfish extremely self absorbed without empathy just awful none of them had any redeeming qualities which made it hard to really care they all acted so stupidly and nonsensically that it was hard to really understand what they were doing i've seen a lot of complaints about the over wrought writing the overuse of metaphors that made no sense i did get that too but i think that listening to it instead of seeing it on the page helped with that i definitely rolled my eyes at a few of them and rewound to listen again thinking i must have heard something wrong but it didn't bother me as much as it seemed to bother a lot of people i'll look for silver's next book she certainly did a good job of making me not like the characters they were well written they were just awful people so i'd like to rate it 3 5 but i can't and i just can't take it to a 4","238":"i was a little unsure of this as certain points right up until the end and then wow what a great ending in hindsight it was a wonderful complex story i can't stop thinking about it always the sign of a great book","239":"i wanted to like this book but it never made sense from every unlikable character to their unlikely actions to descriptive phrases that were just confusing this author was trying too hard","240":"i'm not sure what i really think of this book maybe i didn't really get it but it all seemed kind of pointless other than showing how vindictive people can be there were no real surprises and i didn't really connect with the characters its kind of a let down because i had so much hope for this book but i just didn't get the point of the book 2 stars","241":" an interesting read and a thought provoking perspective on the death penalty i was neutral on death penalty issues until i served as a media witness to an execution by hanging in may 1994 in washington state afterwards i couldn't get rid of the image of the man dangling from the noose swaying slowly but i also watched the victims' family members who were witnesses and while they didn't give any statements to the press that day it sure didn't look like the execution gave them any satisfaction so if even the victims' families don't feel better after an execution where's the benefit it's far more expensive to execute someone than to keep them in prison for the rest of their lives and then there's the whole issue about dna exonerating people long after their convictions but i'm rambling back to the book i didn't particularly like any of the characters in this book even the victim is annoying but i still enjoyed the read","242":"would give it 3 5 stars i agree with a lot of the previous comments i wanted to know the whole story and it was told in a unique way good for discussion","243":"very well written i couldn't put it down","244":"great premise unfortunately i wanted resolution on what 'really' happened and i don't believe it was really there it's hard to explain without spoilers and while i don't mind narration that can't always be trusted this story was just missing some of the plot that said noa is a great character","245":"good debut novel i liked the book but did find some parts a bit long interesting ending","246":"currently still waiting for this book to arrive as part of goodreads firstreads looks great though","247":"i managed to complete the book because noa's true story is unraveled in pieces throughout it and i wanted to know what really happened is she an 'unreliable narrator' did she really do it as she claims in the first few pages there are certainly some developments and revelations that are unpredictable however i never felt any emotional depth from any of the characters and therefore didn't get invested in them i didn't feel nervous for noa as the months ticked down to her execution date the writing is unclear in parts and as i was reading an uncorrected proof i hope they were fixed in the final version for instance silver's inclusion of a side story of another murder involving some construction workers and their boss was so convoluted and wordy that it was impossible to tell who was murdered the editor should have cut that out","248":"this is the first book in ages that i finished in a day i really liked it but just finished binge watching orange is the new black must have a prison theme going in my head when i arrived at the dorm i'm staying in for this conference i was surprised there were doors on the bathroom stalls","249":"silly beach read well i wasn't on the beach but on vacation anyway unbelievable easy read easy to put down i read one review from a magazine suggesting it was the 2013 gone girl hilarious story line is implausible writing is overly verbose and the characters are all unlikeable skip this book","250":"talk about depressing","251":"i picked this book up because of the reviews likening it to gone girl the reviews are wrong noa is nowhere near as complex as the writer wishes you'd think she was even the twists are predictable u0026amp i didn't like a single character in the entire story there's nothing riveting here but the story is fine","252":"interesting twists","253":"the author has not met a simile metaphor or adjective she didn't like and they are all in this book as a result reading the book was like reading a high school freshman's first attempt at creative writing in other words tedious and amateurish","254":"i didn't want to put it down i like that she accepted her execution for a guilt she felt not necessarily what she'd been found guilty of","255":"powerful well written smart book will stay with you","256":" damn of all the people who should try to blame other people for their problems noa just never does which is frustrating and interesting i'm not sure enjoyed is the right word but this book was definitely an experience it felt almost a little too big but maybe not maybe i should have devoured it all in one sitting rather than listening to it half heartedly over two weeks at work i both hated and appreciated the ending and the getting there was quite a ride overall i'm not sorry i read it is that a pathetic description","257":"was completely utterly involved drug along interested until the end a little closure would be nice","258":" elizabeth silver's debut novel the execution of noa p singleton is a fresh take on the legal suspense novel this was selected by my book club and i was not very enthusiastic about it however it didn't take long to realize i was wrong - it sucked me in right from the start the author did a great job developing all the characters especially the victim's mother marlene dixon and noa herself and of unveiling the story of noa as it pivots through the trials and turmoil of her life as her story unfolds we speculate did she really do it is she covering for someone else will some plot twist save her and what's with this steely indifference to her fate any suspense associated with the clemency petition becomes secondary as the author explores the complex relationship of noa to the mother the suspense in this story is not so much whether or not noa is executed but more about if and why she murdered sarah and about why the mother cares if noa is executed or not this book was very good and the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is the ending although i realize that shaping the end of a psychological thriller can be difficult even for seasoned writers i felt it got away from silver a little bit and i thought it left the reader a little bit flat it was an acceptable ending but still i would recommend this book to others and i can't wait to discuss this in my book club","259":"i liked this book in the beginning couldn't put it down but there was just something about it that made me keep from loving it i'm not going to say anymore because i don't want to spoil it for someone else who may love it","260":" noa p singleton is 35 years old has spent ten years incarcerated for murder and is 6 months away from being executed when yet another young lawyer expresses interest in keeping her alive noa is skeptical but this lawyer has been sent by the mother of noa's victim marlene dixon testified against noa ten years ago insisting on both her guilt and the most severe punishment for her crime but now states that she's had a change of mind and wants to help noa try for clemency but marlene also wants the truth about what happened the night her daughter died told from noa's perspective layers of the past are gradually revealed and the reader finds out a few unsavory details about all the people involved author elizabeth l silver succeeds in keeping the story moving the characters have shades of good and bad but are difficult to like marlene's letters to her deceased daughter provide a glimpse into her state of mind but ultimately marlene's motivations remain a mystery and silver employs the annoying tactic of uncompleted sentences throughout the resolution to excuse the characters from explaining themselves leaving the reader hanging a fast paced read that fizzles to a close","261":"very interesting style kept me wanting to know more right up to the end","262":"make no mistake noa is guilty but her story reminds you that everyone has a story a side of events and it makes you question things like what you tell yourself to get through and what would you do i loved it","263":" this book is so unmitigatedly awful that i can't stop thinking about how angry i am that i read the whole thing i only stayed with it because i saw it on entertainment weekly's must list a couple of months back a source i usually trust and now after reading others' reviews i see it was on amazon's june recommendation list as well what a hoax other reviewers have lauded the publicist and marketers for this book and i guess that explains why it was promoted because it certainly did not get there on the merits of the writing first of all the plot is basically a poor man's season of damages with a watered down glen close wanna be as the antagonist much like damages you are never sure who to root for if anyone unlike damages none of the characters are convincingly developed or nuanced in any way in fact the story unwinds in two voices a first hand account from the titular protagonist and an all too convenient epistolary account from the antagonist this device is so sophomoric it conveniently provides information that the protagonist cannot much like a voice over in a poorly written movie screenplay amateur on top of that the voices of the two characters really are not differentiated comparisons of this book to gone girl are completely manufactured hype secondly the writing is maddingly awful other reviewers have lifted quotes from the book which humorously demonstrate the clunky sometimes grammatically incorrect writing style i encourage readers to sample these reviews for a good laugh suffice it to say this book was poorly edited and maybe shouldn't have been greenlit at all i applaud any writer who actually sits down and writes instead of just talking about being a writer i hope the author does not spend time reading these negative reviews because they are hurtful i just feel betrayed by the professional reviewers who promoted this book i kept reminding myself while i was reading that ew had put it on the list so it must get good at any minute now wrong luckily i got my copy at the library so i only wasted time and brain cells not money i think there actually might be a basis for a class action lawsuit against amazon for recommending this i gave this two stars yesterday because well maybe there are worse things out there woke up still fuming about it today so knocked it down to one star","264":"very interesting and absorbing story line but i thought the writing itself was mediocre","265":"a well written book could not stop listening about a young woman waiting on death row for murdering her father's pregnant girl friend nothing is as it first seems the plot turns and continues to surprise highly recommend","266":"no matter how one feels about this book its characters or its ending it's hard to deny that the author created a tense fast paced story based around an extremely interesting and layered protagonist that had you questioning your own feelings and views until the very end","267":" an interesting account of a young woman on death row and her journey to that place noa p singleton killed her father's girlfriend on new years day in 2003 what reason could she possibly have had could it be related to the fact that the girlfriend's mother had paid noa to break up the relationship or is noa so damaged from her past that this punishment is inevitable i felt that the author's reliance on inappropriate similes and awkward metaphors detracted from the narrative noa was not particularly sympathetic and i can't say i cared about her very much the villain of the piece was well done and callously cruel","268":"3 5 stars this was a page turner i don't know how i felt about it it was certainly good but at times i felt like the writing style for noa and marlene was the same and it creeped me out","269":"held my attention well","270":"3 5 stars engaging yet somehow vaguely disappointing at the end","271":"read my full review of this book on my blog summer reading project a the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver","272":"a shaky start on this book overall well written if you can get past the somewhat forced sarcastic monologue of the noa at the beginning then the book develops a rhythm not completely convincing relationships between characters but the story unfolds at a good pace that will keep you reading and invested in noa i debated on the actual rating but i think in the end the writing did make this book and slightly shaky plot at times worth the read i do think with deeper character development it could have been bumped up","273":"written in the voice of a woman on death row during the last six months before her execution date as she interacts with a lawyer supposedly preparing a clemency petition supported by the mother of the victim not surprisingly the story gets much more complicated as we peel back the layers and delve deeper into both the mind of the narrator and the facts of the crime extremely well done hard to believe that this is a first novel and hoping it won't be the last from this author","274":"really good book makes you think about how much of your life depends on things that are out of your control and how you react","275":"a complicated story that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster ride about the time you think you have things figured out silver lets you know you are wrong again this books got great ratings for good reasons i listened to it on audio during a trip i wonder how i would have felt reading it read it and let me know","276":"enjoyed this book that follows the attempts to avert an execution of noa for the murder of her fathers girlfriend good character development noa doesn't assist on her own defense and the mother of the deceased girl feigns a clemency fight on order to try and learn what happened to her daughter sarah mother isn't like able is driven and deceitful","277":"very interesting premise of a book in that noa singleton six months away from her execution date gets help with a new appeal from a new attorney hired by the victim's mother noa's an unreliable narrator and some parts of the story are riveting but ultimately i found the novel over written and the ending not all that worthy let alone believable","278":"interesting read flawed characters just like real life","279":"2 5 stars spoiler ahead the author tries a little to hard to impress the characters engage in really questionable decision making from beginning to end what is everyone's motivation over and over and the three times a charm 'invasion' was just irritating i can handle a book with unlikable characters but the flatness of the cast is more unforgivable","280":" i received this book from a goodreads give away for first reads i enjoyed reading this book the writing drew me in immediately and i flew through it to find out what happened that lead noa to being executed i thought it was going to drag on but this wasn't the case there were memoirs from noa as well as letters from the victim's mother the ending was a little unsettling after i finished the book i had to muse on my thoughts and feelings about what i had just read i felt that the author used words that i had to look up where other words would have been sufficient","281":"the plot was interesting and had good twists but the writing was a bit uneven taxing at times so many of the metaphors seemed out of place trying to hard would be the best way to describe it and none of the characters were particularly likable i couldn't feel sympathy for any of them not one and the younger version of noa and sarah were both unbelievable as young women and a bit insufferable","282":" i really struggle to understand the stellar reviews on the cover of this book while the storyline was interesting and kept me engaged many problems exist in the writing elizabeth silver's apparent love of metaphors made me want to throw the book down countless times i was reminded of that list circulating the web of actual metaphors used in student writing such as he hit the pavement like a hefty bag filled with vegetable soup yeah that type of metaphor i also wonder if anyone bothered to edit this book i can't even begin to count the problems poorly constructed sentences confusing dialogue and lack of punctuation since this is a first book for silver i'm hoping she will pay attention to the criticisms as well as the praise","283":"couldn't finish this one read my thoughts on my blog http wordswisdomwhitney wordpress c","284":"loved the philly flavor the complicated heroine and her baffling adversary the story that gets revealed very smartly over the entire book went places i didn't anticipate but it was there for me to discover all along and i felt anguish over the capital punishment it did feel like a first novel or it was just a little wordy for my taste but there was a lot of talent on display here and i look forward to more by the author","285":"the idea of the story was strong but i feel like the author was trying too hard with all the philosophy ideas in the story that it began to get muddled","286":"great first novel and summer read really made me appreciate the sunset today and contemplate our penal system unintended consequences","287":"luckily this was not a long book because although i got somewhat hooked into the what happened i did not care for the who it happened to none of the characters were sympathetic or especially real to me and i did not care what happened to any of them by the end","288":"the premise was really interesting the writing was not this author is metaphor crazy and some of her metaphors were so over the top and rambling that they were hard to follow she used every big fancy word she could find in her thesaurus and peppered them in making the prose feel pretentious and stiff it took away from the story it was really hard to care about any of the characters and the ending just fell flat","289":"did not finish very slow and couldn't get into the story","290":"good story line but i wanted the ending to be different in my mind was disappointed with the ending but i guess it had to happen that way for the author first time read for author elizabeth silver i will check out other books she has written","291":" a number of 2013 releases have been compared to gone girl including this one while it didn't live up to the hype i still found the execution of noa p singleton to be engaging fast paced and hard for me to put down until the very end while i didnt like noa or what she did i didnt like any of the characters for that matter except for maybe oliver although madeline didnt pull the trigger i believe she was the catalyst for the events that unraveled and believe she should have served time in jail as well actually i found myself disliking her more than noa if the author's intent was to give us a cast of characters which we would dislike she succeeded as the majority of these characters including the deceased victim were dislikable some were even despicable and had no redeeming characters execution is a very dark storyline which portrays the unfairness and unjustness of our legals system even thought someone might be found guilty evidence might still be suppressed and the truth very different from what was presented silver captured my attention with execution and i'm willing to give future novels a read","292":"loved this book can't wait for her next book very well written although some parts dragged a bit 3 5 stars","293":"didn't connect with the book story line felt promising but fell short for me perhaps i am too impatient","294":"i would have liked to have seen a bit of justice done to the people she steered noa through her life especially the indomitable mrs m","295":" noa singleton is awaiting death in a maximum security prison as the novel opens she has been there ten years and accustomed to the rules and regulations seemingly out of the blue she is visited by marlene dixon a high powered philadelphia attorney who is also the mother of the woman noa is accused of killing she tells noa that she has changed her mind about the death penalty and will do everything in her power to convince the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison she asks only in return for noa to relate the events concerning her daughter's death noa has never revealed details about the killing of sarah and refuses even if it means saving her life the reader gets the back story on noa's life from the time she is born to a negligent mother and an absentee father to her graduating from high school as salutatorian to her half year in college we also learn that her father attempts to contact her with a series of hang up calls until she finally answers and they meet her father has been in prison and brutally beats a man who tries to break into his bar in front of his daughter they have a rocky relationship until marlene wants her to spy on her father and her daughter and pays noa ten thousand dollars noa sees the couple going into a maternity clinic and realizes that sarah is the same age as she the action shifts back to the prison and marlene brings a another lawyer to work on her case obviously we have a lot of noa's reminisces and she thinks about what she will have for her last meal marlene is desperate to learn the details of sarah's murder and noa stubbornly refuse to appease her can the two women find a solution to reduce noa's death sentence and give marlene the information she craves","296":"boy did i enjoy this book the author unfolds this story in two voices and the writing style is so unique modern with many current day references i looked forward to the opportunity to read this book every day peeling back the story to get to the end the protagonist noa is brilliant' frustrating shocking and someone i have thought about often since finishing the book i strongly encourage you read it you need to read this character and her nemesis so good","297":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the further you read the more you realize that there is a lot you don't know and then you keep reading first person works really well as do the letters that are embedded it did not go where i thought it was going and i kept hoping there was a way out not understanding the protagonists' resignation one or two loose ends that left me dissatisfied but it was somewhat like reading gone girl without the adrenaline hope author continues writing","298":"noa p singleton is on death row this novel tells the story of the months leading up to her execution and the details of her crime it was a good read a little slow at times but the end had you reading as fast as you could to find out what happened","299":"going into this book i was expecting to be thrilled instead i found myself bored and not really caring about any of the characters","300":"i like that the story isn't confusing just to muddle the reader the structure really suits the narrative and the story is intriguing see my full review here","301":"pretty good book kept me interested to find out what really happened and yet it wasn't as wonderfully written as the last few mystery books i have read","302":"silver's first novel it was excellent and very well written noah's choices in life are reflected and owned i'm glad my reader hasdictionary abilities several sentences were so cleverly said i had to read them couple times","303":"since i belong to a book club that exclusively reads debut novels i feel confident in saying this was a strong debut for author elizabeth silver i do not tend to read courtroom or crime drama novels very often so this one may have been filled with cliches or a certain level of predictability but it was likely lost on me i enjoyed the story it kept me quite interested and i believe it was told over a reasonable number of pages i have read several books lately that just went on for too long or seemingly lost steam in the middle noa was an interesting character she was seemingly a victim of circumstances quite a bit or did she look for trouble taking marlene's bribe in the first place for instance i almost liked this strange dichotomy going on throughout the novel that kept you guessing about noa's true character the character of marlene was a bit of an over exaggeration of the mama bear legal eagle but it mostly worked she bullied everyone in her life noa oliver sarah caleb but her status is really what drove each of these individuals to do as she said because they had little to no recourse i thought this novel also had interesting observations on social status and it encouraged me to think what would have happened if sarah had been the accused and noa the victim overall a good read it held my interest and the story was enjoyable not the best book i read this year but certainly not the worst our book club is a bit of a mixed bag since we read debuts but it makes us eager to see what some of these authors will write next","304":"read it on audio a smart thriller that kept me guessing","305":"silver has given us a really engaging character in noa but this book just didn't hold me atwood's alias grace did this better","306":"this was a disjointed mess i think she was trying for some profound statement but it came out as schlock sorry i can not recommend this read the book thief if you want to read something wonderful","307":"this was a great book it was told in reverse starting with noa in prison and back tracking to what happened to get her there that style really made the book that much more interesting there was a mystery suspense aspect to it although i don't think i would put it in that classification i was in suspense as to what really happened and what really played out on that day this is the first novel for this author and i hope she comes out with another one soon","308":"had trouble finishing i might come back to it","309":"loved this book i couldn't put it down","310":"i loved this novel for its sharp voice and unwillingness to sugar coat any of the topics tackled in a story about capital punishment and the stories behind the crimes u0026amp people that society deems worthy of executing silver's writing is smart insightful and always entertaining the book didn't turn out how i expected it to and it avoided melodrama and cliche in places where i'd usually anticipate them great great book which will leave you with lots to think about","311":" noa p singleton is on death row for the murder of her father's girlfriend and her unborn child just weeks before her execution date the mother of the murdered girlfriend visits noa and offers to try to have her sentence commuted to life in prison in exchange for an explanation for noa's actions as noa tells her story over the course of the weeks leading up to her execution we learn that things are not as cut and dry as they appeared to the jury who found noa guilty writingthis is a debut novel but you'd never guess from the writing i was very impressed with the quality and style exhibited by the author it certainly deserves the blurbs you'll find on the back from authors like herman koch noa is my favorite type of unreliable narrator you truly can't tell if she's lying or telling the truth and marlene the mother of the murdered woman is equally intriguing i think the author managed to capture the ethical dilemma presented by the death penalty as well as the morally ambiguous decisions that juries face in way that make the reader thing without providing the author's opinion or moral lecturing entertainment valueit's definitely a page turner but with a literary bent it's been compared to gone girl in several reviews and i think it's a fair comparison especially in terms of having morally ambiguous and not necessarily sympathetic characters it's a good example of a literary work with excellent writing that also reads quickly and easily overallif you liked gone girl if you like unreliable narrators and if you like morally ambiguous books that may lead you to re evaluate your beliefs this is a good read i'd also compare it to herman koch's the dinner which i also enjoyed thank you to tlc for providing me a copy of the book to review to see the other sites on the tour click here","312":"i thought this was a fabulous book i'm surprised it doesn't have a higher rating i can't say much without giving anything away but it's extremely well written and has some surprising twists in it i read this in two nights and it's been quite some time since i picked up a book that i didn't want to put down if i didn't have a job i would have read it in one sitting i could definitely see this book being turned into a movie","313":"ok book not as good as the critics praised it","314":"pretty good book on a very dark subject mystery style lots of time changes and flashbacks good summer read","315":"this is a page turning mystery filled with complicated characters and meticulous attention to detail in each chapter a little more is revealed about what actually happened and why highly recommended","316":"4 5 stars it lost half a star because of the library mistake this is a book about desperation delusion and the lies we tell ourselves to survive neither narrator noa or marlene can be entirely believed but i find noa far more relatable and sincere than marlene marlene is perhaps one of the worst villains i've ever encountered partly because she has deluded herself into being completely unaware of her crimes of what she has done and the lives she has ruined a woman who abuses her power and wealth who lives to control and manipulate others noa never had a chance neither did sarah i can understand the low ratings others gave to this book it ends with a tragic nihilism that seems almost wasteful but this isn't a book about redemption or truth so the pathos of the last pages was a fitting end a book recommended for the reader interested in psychological thrillers not for the person who needs a neat and tidy ending","317":"i really wanted to enjoy this more the ending was unsatisfying and bizarre the main protagonist was interesting but underdeveloped","318":"sort of confused as to the point of this book why did noa not say anything sooner about what really happened was it guilt over her childhood this book left me confused and mildly depressed i need to rethink the reviews i read as i have been disappointed by more and more books lately","319":"quick page turner plot twists well developed characters strong writing not a stand out but not bad either","320":"this book was amazing enthralling and fascinating i never saw the twist coming and then i never saw the other twist coming","321":"i chose this book because of a glowing review that praised the elizabeth silver's writing some of her wordsmithing is quite good while much of it is simply too much of a good thing the story line kept me reading although one particular key relationship seemed unrealistic it was a good book just not one of the best","322":" i kept waiting for this book to get better but it didn't it didn't help that the book review i read labeled the book this year's gone girl umm not so much not even close my expectations were dashed what was wrong with the book just the story and the characters the story didn't go anywhere it wasn't suspenseful it was pretty predictable and it did not hold my attention the characters were not likeable not that they have to be in order for me to like a book but they weren't that interesting either to the book's credit the author wrote well that may sound like a contradiction for a story that doesn't go anywhere and has flat characters but she at least wrote at an adult level i did finish the book so it rates 2 stars but no more than that","323":"it's really a 2 5 but there was no way that i could round up top 3 stars in good conscience never takes me this long to get through a book but the characters sucked really didn't pick up until the last 2 chapters but you have to plod through the rest of the book to get to it save yourself don't do it","324":"not sure how i feel about this complicated story of a woman accused and convicted of murder read it nonstop in a couple of hours could not put it down but it was unsettling","325":"whoa noa what a book riveting story telling fast paced yet detailed writing great clippy dialogue not really a who done it but more of a why done it so many twists there were times my heart raced i just couldn't put this book down in fact i plopped my kids in front of the tv with their dinner tonight so i could finish a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do i enjoyed the philadelphia setting too","326":"great book great writing keeps you guessing until the end","327":"this book is not one i would recommend or reread i'm not a big fan of first person narratives and it didn't help this book that i really did not like the main character noa nor did i feel much sympathy for her or her situation mostly i felt apathetic about the entire book including the not really a surprise ending that left me thinking noa got what she deserved","328":"very unsure how i feel about this book i was waiting for a big twist or a big reveal and in a way that happened but not in the way that would have been the most satisfying slow in parts and some characters were completely unnecessary to the narrative but overall a decent read","329":"i liked it but felt nothing for the protagonist noa who's on death row as i read i kept thinking this book would take off somehow but it never really did the ending was a whimper not a bang there were a couple of good and unexpected reveals but these only served to reinforce my antipathy for the main character i can't fault the writing which was good","330":"though well written i was disappointed in the ending","331":"the plot of this book really intrigued me but i hesitated to read it given the mixed reviews very glad that i read it first chapter or two were a bit tough for some reason but then i had a hard time putting it down while most of the characters are not endearing likeable i enjoyed the story line and the reveal throughout 4 5 stars for me","332":"i was carried along by the plot of this narrative and found myself wanting to know noa's story which she was so reluctant to give i didn't feel any bond with her though didn't root for clemency or feel sad when her x day drew ever nearer there were a few plot devices i was unsure of the persephone story seemed somewhat underdeveloped as did noa's mothers role readable but didn't set the world alight 2 5 stars if it were possible","333":"too wordy take out all the extra unnecessary words and you've got a short story","334":"i truly don't know whether i liked or disliked this book i recall wanting to hurry the book along while i was reading it to find out the ending and at other times not really caring if i finished the book noa p singleton is an unreliable narrator an odd cold sarcastic death row inmate with only six months left to live at the beginning of the book she does not try to win any likeability contests or rationalize the crime for which she was convicted 10 years ago noa's story moves slowly and there were many times that i did not understand her motivations at all the audiobook narrator was perfect for capturing noa's monotone accepting of her fate voice however i was annoyed by the author's grandiose language it felt like she was flaunting her fancy college degree it was unbelievable that noa would use those words since she never even finished college herself on the whole the book utilized an interesting setup and storytelling mechanism but i'm not sure it fully achieved its goal then again it could just be because the main character narrator was unlikeable and perhaps i prefer things to be different","335":" thie author uses a host of cliches and caricatures to tell a simple story while the she has the burden of creating a suspension of disbelief there is too much of a chasm here to cross noa p singleton awaits her execution date convicted of murder with hardly a defense she has burned through all of her appeals out of the blue the mother of her victim marlene dixon reaches out to her to attempt a last minute clemency what makes this doubly surprising is that marlene's theatrics and manipulation are the reason noa faces the death penalty marlene's price for clemency is to find out what really happened to her daughter on the night of her death the author hides behind this device to tell noa's story the characters are not fleshed out enough to feel any empathy for anyone the villains are too comic book to be real typically if someone gets railroaded into something there has to be some level of police coercion the situation noa gets herself into seems too far fetched to believe even in the realms of law and order type tv shows a little more research and fleshing out may have helped with that aspect the motivations of the main character seem very flawed during the main incident there's just something missing here it would be nice if the author took this story in a certain direction there is only one section that's salvageable where she talks about the difference between life in prison and the death penalty she talks about how someone from one class cannot infringe on a higher class the penalty is almost always death in this case it is true both metaphorically and literally it ends up being a very disappointing read with a lot of potential but no direction","336":"nora's on death row for the murder of a woman her age the novel reveals reasons for her actions but did so mechanically i didn't care didn't feel the guilt or tension","337":" i won an advanced copy of the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver in a read it forward give a way and from netgalley com my review contains my honest thoughts and opinions i am surprised that the execution of noa p singleton received such mixed reviews i thought it was a riveting and thought provoking story i certainly would recommend it as a book club selection because there were issues regarding innocence accountability and the death penalty that would lead to a worthwhile discussion but i found the novel to be a fascinating read on its own no discussion necessary the book was not a happy one when the novel opened noa was already on death row awaiting execution she did nothing to help with her defense her appeals have been denied noa's chances at life were slim to none the mother of the victim marlene a successful attorney apparently had a change of heart regarding death as a form of justice and punishment and approached noa about filing a clemency petition on behalf of m a d mothers against death an organization recently formed by marlene marlene was a dark controlling character and her intentions were much more sinister than portrayed it was her attempt to discover the truth of what happened the night her daughter was killed without any real objective of saving noa's life though marlene denied it her actions played a substantial role in her daughter's death those were the basic facts of the story but there was much more to it noa was a good person who was lost from the start she had a self absorbed mother an absent father and lacked guidance from any responsible role model in fact noa as a child was forced to act like the adult yet despite her circumstances noa was salutatorian of her high school graduating class though the achievement wasn't of much importance to her noa also attended the university of pennsylvania albeit it was for only one year clearly she was trying to break the destructive pattern that she was born into and at least for awhile she was succeeding even if she did hold herself at a distance but quite quickly her life started to unravel and without any real support system plummeted family and life disappointed noa time and time again and the skewered self preservation tools that she had to work with added to the unfortunate choices that noa made for herself and for others the only negatives i have about the book are that i wish that noa could have had a happier life she was a decent young woman doing the best she could her spiraling descent took a toll after awhile additionally it did not make sense to me that noa was permitted to wear a diamond bracelet in prison aren't a prisoner's personal belongings confiscated upon entering a correctional facility further although realistic i hoped for a more satisfying ending","338":"i have been on an unreliable narrator kick lately gone girl the dinner and the other typist to name a few all of the books are narrated by a character who wants to be seen in the best possible light but who can't ever really hide their dark underbelly gone girl was truly shocking to me but the more i read these kind of books the more a pattern emerges everything the narrator says is all roses and kittens and then a psychologist will weigh in with their two cents somewhere near the end of the book and i guess the reader is supposed to believe that the true nature of the character has been exposed in this book noa p singleton is awaiting execution for the murder of her father's girlfriend the book counts down the months as the execution approaches and gives us one last tantalizing chapter while noa is awaiting her date with death she is visited by marlene dixon who is the mother of the girl she murdered if noa will tell her why she killed her daughter she will help her get off death row maureen is a powerful attorney so this is not an idle promise she can make it happen without her help noa is out of options i really wanted to love this book but there were a few problems for one all of the answers and action are loaded at the end of the book i could see literally on page 245 where the action geared up to the point that the reader would finally get some answers the other problem was that i never believed that the girl noa murdered would have ever been in the relationship she was which was the catalyst for half the book it didn't make sense to me i guess you either bought it or you didn't i didn't i think there is a lot of things for a reading group to puzzle and dissect there is always is with this kind of novel you are always left wondering what is the true part of the story and what was the part the character wanted you to believe in the end the whole thing is made up anyway so i am not going to ponder too hard it was a quick read but in the end i don't think it quite lived up to the hype in entertainment weekly","339":"i liked the story in this book but i hated the ending the story is told from 2 perspectives noa is on death row for murdering a woman she never denies that she did it but throughout the book the reader learns the circumstances the other part of the book is told by marlene the murder victim's mother it was an intriguing story and other than the last chapter i enjoyed the book","340":"silver's novel is the featured book of the month in our library system i always read books the library has chosen books that i might not select without their referral and i am usually pleased with the choices in silver's novel however i didn't find one character to admire or even like and i was never quite sure if the narrator noa singleton on death row for capital murder was telling the truth about her life or not the book did however raise a number of issues surrounding crime and punishment in this country...when should the death penalty be applied what kinds of evidence should be considered before a verdict is delivered how does a person's childhood influence their adult behavior what kinds of extenuating circumstances should be considered before sentencing should the accused be required to testify who else may be involved in the circumstamces that lead to crime and do they bear any responsibility for it is it necessary to like the characters in a book i'm not sure but it certainly does diminish my reading pleasure when that happens it's the reason i didn't like gone girl and would not recommend it to anyone silver's book however offers a number of ideas to ponder...a difficult read for people who like their world easy right and wrong clear everything in black and white a good book for discussion","341":"man i busted butt to read this book in a day because i was sooooo convinced it was going to be a hit home thriller i thought for sure that there would be point it would have been easier to get out of a pool of oil after having belly flopped into it from 300 feet then sort out this mess of a book that is all","342":" noa p singleton is in her late twenties intelligent although she chose to drop out of college attractive sharp tongued sometimes tender sometimes bitter and sitting on death row she is quite resigned to the fact that she is going to be executed because she did after all commit the crime unexpectedly the victim's mother a high powered lawyer brings a colleague to visit noa with the news that they are going to file for clemency in the hopes of having noa's sentence transferred to life in prison noa's story is told in turns through noa's diary her conversations with her attorney and letters written by the victim's mother to her dead daughter noa's story is a sad one of a life filled with making the wrong choice at a crucial moment in time overall this was a pretty good book my problem is that the timing of my reading of this book was horrible i had recently read burial rites by hannah kent and although one is historical fiction and one is pure fiction the books are very similar in subject matter i may have thought more highly of ms silver's book but in the shadow of burial rites it unfortunately ranks as a poor contender i certainly do not want to dissuade anyone from picking up this book i only wish i had read the two books in reverse order or had a little more time between the two","343":"this story was compared to gone girl in my opinion gone girl was so much better i did though enjoy this book i finished reading it u0026amp it left me still asking questions probably give it a 3 5 rating","344":"love this book you will fall completely for the main character despite her flaws it makes you think and it keeps you on the edge of your seat i would definitely recommend it","345":" it's 3am and i've just finished reading this book after three hours of this enthralling captivating and suspense filled novel while i must confess i am sitting here a little perplexed after the ending of the novel i cannot fault the novel for its ability to engage me the reader for three hours i literally could not put the book down silver developed each character wonderfully and allows us the time to learn the past present and potential future of noa an easy read perfect for bed time reading if anyone would like to explain the ending to me and the significance of persephone riga that would be greatly appreciated","346":" the story line is intriguing and the author does a good job of pulling you in and arousing your curiosity which is a good thing because i had to frequently force myself to continue to listen to this audiobook the author uses ridiculous metaphors and fancy phases as though trying to constantly impress us with her command of the language for example i was in the diminutive holding cell oliver trotted eagerly in first like a wet surfer trying so desparately not to miss his second wave the cherry contour of his face and here's a good one the polysyllabic connection of letters that spelled out mahrrrrleeeen dihhhck sunn brought me to nauseous self flagellation every time i heard it come on","347":"a stunning and thought provoking psychological novel about guilt betrayal and remorse told in an unusual set of flashbacks by a woman on death row and in letters to the victim by her bereaved mother the reader is forced to rethink his idea of guilt and innocence and what punishment is just as the dark but beautifully written story slowly reveals the true nature of the main characters","348":"wow this book was outstanding i can say nothing else because peeling the layers away at your own pace is such an important part of the experience i'm still recovering i can't wait for someone else to read this so i can talk about all the feelingsfind all my reviews at http readingatrandom blogspot com 2","349":"a compelling story of a woman one death row for murdering her father's young girlfriend but the story is more complicated than that as it is unwound in the flashback chapters a quick read but one that keeps you guessing and finally reveals true evil not where you expect it but rather in one of the characters supposedly wronged by noa","350":"this is an enthralling novel which has you guessing all the way through about what actually did happen and whether the death penalty really will be carried out","351":"solid read definitely worth it to read a little scattered here and there but overall great for summer","352":"more like 3 5 i was interested the entire time but felt the ending fell short i know liking noa wasn't the point but it was harder for me to rate this a 4 when i sort of despised the main character i did enjoy the feeling that she was an unreliable narrator in a way or we were made to feel like we shouldn't trust her","353":"really good read ending flopped","354":"this is the first book i've ever read that i couldn't put down but still ended up hating the characters never fully develop u0026amp it was very poorly written the author tries too hard to make this a psychological thriller u0026amp fails miserably everything was just too over the top for my taste from the plot to the dialogue","355":"a bit unresolved and slightly confusing but an ok read","356":"i think the book would have been stronger if marlene had been the narrator she gets more and more interesting as the story progresses the death penalty part of the book is kind of cynical marlene's motives after the trial are to increase noa's pain the character of oliver is a problem he seems to appear in order to give the author dialog we don't get to know him well enough to consider him more than a novelist's prop then he disappears when the story doesn't need him any more there was a mild attempt to spark a relationship between ollie and noa but that also just hangs there","357":"noa reminisces as she sits on death row waiting for x day","358":"wow what a great debut novel noa p singleton is on death row awaiting execution she gets a surprise visit from marlene dixon a powerful attorney who just happens to be the mother of noa's victim marlene has had a change of heart and tells noa that she's going to try to get clemency for her oliver a new attorney with her firm will be noa's contact oliver gets noa to start telling her story and it will alarm and shock readers i couldn't put this book down","359":" i would have rather given this 3 5 stars since i bounced back and forth between 3 and 4 i enjoyed this book i read it quickly it was a page turner for sure i'm not going to go into plot details since i don't want to spoil anything however depending on your opinions about capital punishment and the judicial system in the united states this book may challenge your thoughts or may affirm your beliefs either way the author keeps you interested by only revealing small tidbits of noa's life past and present and the world of her supporting cast she's an unreliable narrator some may even say she's unlikeable but i think that makes the story endearing if we liked every character in a book there would be no emotion no turmoil it would be boring this book was definitely not boring","360":"actually 4 1 2 stars really liked the story and the storytelling she has a beautiful writing style that on occasion becomes heavy handed but not very often recommend this book highly","361":" there is no doubt about this author's skill in characterization reading this book i felt like i knew its main character noa p singleton as the trials and tribulations that make up her life are gradually revealed throughout the book i read with baited breath trying to find out what would happen to her would she be executed or would the mother of her victim succeed in her pursuit of clemency what disappointed was the ending i do not want to detail it here but leading up to the last 50 pages i felt as though the author had a clear vision for how the book would wrap up unfortunately the end did not resonate with me the way i was hoping it would instead it felt as though it was not the caliber of the narrative that preceded it warranted","362":"original take on a criminal case cleverly constructed for maximum suspense but ultimately a strangely dissatisfying read","363":"okay read surprise and confusing ending","364":"this novel has an intriguing premise a woman on death row is approached by the mother of the victim who offers to help her apply for clemency but i didn't care for the framing device the victim's mother writing letters to her dead daughter","365":" a story about a young woman on death row and the months leading up to this moment it is a well written plot that keeps you engrossed but it is full of sadness i feel that in the end no one is happy at the outcome this novel is an emotional journey that takes you through the life of noa p singleton so you can better understand how she ended up in the situation where she took a life you also get a glimpse into the victims mother noa is a character who has a troubled childhood without the love of her parents and the only person she could depend on was herself this is so much more than the execution of noa and will keep you glued to the story all the way to the last page it will also leave you thinking about it long after you finish it that to me is the definition of a great book","366":" first don't listen to the comparisons to gone girl this book is no gone girl perhaps if it had been the authors 5th novel instead of first it may have been closer to that but no this book is okay but gets a meh rating the characters were undeveloped and their actions made no sense the plot had potential but it didn't flow well the sequence of events or points of view were perplexing and not in a good mystery novel kind of way at times i wasn't sure what the author was trying to get across even the end which shouldn't really have been a surprise to anyone made me think that's it the writing was also strange there is definitely an excellent writer in there somewhere but this particular offering was so heavy with nonsensical metaphors that the writing distracted me from the story which is never good if a reader has to stop to ponder what the heck an author is talking about instead of turning the page to see what happens next there's a problem in my opinion metaphors are supposed to make sense to make the reader nod in understanding if only on the inside for example at one stage the author uses the metaphor of a prostrated ocean to describe someone's docile voice i kept wondering what exactly a prostrated ocean would look like a calm lake perhaps either way only 2 stars from me","367":"expected more from this than i got i like unreliable narrators but there is not one character in this novel that is remotely sympathetic except the lawyer who tries to help noa","368":"loved it really well written readable and hard to put down looking forward to hearing lots more from this author in the future","369":"interesting perspective of the main character good read book delves into the characters' intense feelings and thoughts","370":"although the premise was interesting i felt the book was too disjointed there were some surprises as you read along i also think my low star rating is because i found the book disturbing on many levels","371":"for starters this was the same narrator from eleanor and park which i loved so much it was really unsettling to listen to eleanor's voice being a death row criminal and the story didn't really interest me at all","372":"first time novelist needs to pare down the wordiness it seemed like she was a bit in love with the sound of her own words interesting story u0026amp presentation but dragged in many places because of the verbosity","373":"3 5 really yet another unlikeable protagonist who may or may not be an unreliable narrator is this a theme these days well written thought provoking re guilt and innocence","374":"good but a little stupd","375":"a woman reviews her life in chilling detail and how she got to death row","376":"this ends my push to read as many books as possible before returning to work this definitely kept me reading to find out how it would end twisted and suspenseful","377":"this is actually more like a 3 50 than a 4 one particular plot point seemed gratuitous and affected the way i felt about the final 1 4 of the book but it's definitely a book that will capture your attention","378":" you know how sometimes you start a book and you know you are going to love it and then you don't this had the set up i love noa's voice a smart girl who has had hard knocks and hasn't fit in reviews the world in a sarcastic voice that masks a soft heart but the narrators purposely mislead you and its just not fair that they set you up to figure out the story and it doesn't unfold that way i'm all for twists and turns that you couldn't see coming but not one with details that don't make sense once the twist occurs also the loathsome mother who is basically only seen through letters to her dead daughter is way underdeveloped","379":"i don't know what i can say about this book other than you should read this book it chronicles the impending execution of noa sentenced to death for the murder of another young woman about her age told from noa's point of view noa doesn't rail against the system or claim to be a victim of a set up in fact noa does little to nothing to fight her conviction or sentence and tries to explain this to what she thinks is yet another eager beaver pro bono defense attorney who shows up to explain that the mother of the victim has had a change of heart and is now planning to file a clemency petition on noa's behalf what follows is the strange and gripping tale of noa's life and what brought her to death row it took me a while to figure out why i was so entranced by this book and i realized it's because i was never entirely sure what was happening was noa innocent why didn't she fight harder to clear her name or wait maybe she really did do it is she martyring herself noa is one of those people who pushes people away who says provocative things she may or may not believe not just to get a rise out of people which i personally detest but to push them away minus all the cloying altruism of he's too good for me or what have you she's prone to lies and exaggerations but are these indicators of a sociopath or just someone who's proud and doesn't like to admit hurt or defeat yet knowing all this she still comes across as clear sane intelligent and rational so how the hell did she end up on death row and why isn't she doing anything about it this book is executed so flawlessly that it isn't until the author reveals additional tidbits of information several chapters later that you even realize you missed that detail the first time you get so distracted in what noa's story is and the way she tells it that you forget to question what she isn't telling you the novel mainly shifts back between the story of noa's life and what led her to philly and her present day interactions with the clemency attorney and the victim's mother marlene of course i was gripped by trying to get to the ultimate questions of did she do it and why but the story was much more compelling than just trying to answer those questions i finally realized that noa p isn't just a work of fiction or even a mystery but really a pscyhological thriller masked as the former and for those reasons i won't go into the details of what i felt about which characters by the end i think i know what happened and i think i know whose side i was on but the only thing i know for sure is that this was an imaginative well researched impeccably delivered novel that needs to be made into a move like last week so before it hits the theaters read this book i received a free copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for my honest unbiased review","380":"i liked this book i'm not sure why maybe it's because i listened to it as a book on tape and liked the readers there were way to many metaphors not every sentence needs a metaphor i found the ending frustrating i wanted noa to yell at marlene and caleb i wanted her to stop being a martyr even though noa did what she did the others should have to share in the culpability or at least acknowledge their part sigh i still liked the book","381":"none of the characters are particularly likable but the story propels you forward beautifully written","382":"3 5 stars it was a slow start for me but then it completely became a page turner i had to find out what happened and what the real story was i loved how pieces of noa's entire life ended up playing a role in the infamous day i really didn't know what to expect overall from the plot and the secondary characters but that came into play way more than i thought and spun in a way i never expected full review to come","383":"i did like the book the writing sometimes made it hard to understand what was happening eg so much description i had to re read to find out he pulled her back inside i liked noa the other characters not so much there was much to think about i found the story very interesting and i had to find out how it ended although it was not as compelling a read as i expected","384":"there are certain things i loved about this book but i don't think it's quite there i'd read another book by elizabeth l silver though i sure would","385":"i would rate this a 2 5 the writing was mostly engaging but i thought the premise was squandered i also found the plotting and noa's musings rather meandering and muddled whatever twist might have been intended at the end also left me rather weary confused and let down","386":"it had potential i found the ending really unsatisfactory","387":" noa p singleton is on death row awaiting her execution for murdering sarah dixon she has never proclaimed her innocence and isn't trying to fight her fate the book reads like her memoir telling us about her life from childhood through the crime and readers are wondering throughout why she did what she did if she truly did do it or if there is more to the story than meets the eye read it to find out i really can't say enough good things about this book it will stay with you long after reading the last page","388":"the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth silver is definitely a page turner and one i was unable to set down i truly enjoyed this book and suggest others read it as well","389":"it was an interesting take on the death penalty it would make an interesting book club discussion","390":" quick easy read kept me guessing noa p singleton is on death row for murdering her estranged dad's girlfriend six months away from her execution date she is visited by marlene dixon marlene is a high powered philadelphia attorney who is also the mother of the woman noa killed marlene tells noa that she has changed her mind about the death penalty and noa's sentence and will do everything in her considerable power to convince the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison in return for the one thing noa is unwilling to trade her story noa has never spoken of the events on the day of the murder noa is far from convinced that marlene deserves the salvation she alone can deliver marlene is a piece of work noa is a not a sympathetic character in the least she is a sarcastic sociopath noa is also an unreliable narrator which adds to the atmosphere","391":"audionot an uplifting story","392":"i got through it for book club i would have stopped before if it wasn't for bookclub i thought that the writing was a bit gimmicky how the story was slowly revealed due to her flashbacks","393":"the novel documents a woman's last six months before her execution for capital murder i felt this style of real time and detail containing flashbacks worked to keep the reader totally involved in the plot it was hard to put down and left me pondering how i truly felt about the death penalty","394":"4 5 great summer read almost read this book in one sitting the story of noa p singleton who is on death row hard to write a review without giving too much away","395":" ooh this book i don't know what to think of it do i like it do i hate it is it good is it bad i don't know yet i don't know if i ever can decide or if i care enough to bother not my favorite but it had its moments i didn't quite care enough about any of the characters to be interested about what happened to them it was kind of cool and creepy the way everything came together in the end and i admire the author for getting all the pieces tied up together expect for the father what the heck happened to the father also the mom was a little too detached to be really believable and why mention noa's brother at all if he had no part in the greater story yeah ok this book wasn't really that great maybe the author's next one will be better","396":" i know i did it the state knows i did it though they never really cared why even my lawyers knew i did it from the moment i liquidated my metallic savings bank hoarded in the bloated gut of a pink pig to pay their bills i was lucid attentive mentally sound and pumped with a single cup of decaffeinated lemon zinger tea when i pulled the trigger post conviction i never contested that once when noa p singleton was put on trial for killing sarah dixon she never took the stand in her own defence and the state's weak melodramatic case was enough to give her the death penalty now after a decade in jail and her execution date six months away noa is suddenly approached by sarah's mother marlene at the trial marlene stated that noa was exactly the kind of person the death penalty was designed for now she offers to use her considerable influence as a high powered attorney to get noa granted clemency - life in prison instead of death in exchange marlene wants noa to prove that she's reformed specifically by revealing the all the details that she never confessed during the trial - her motives and the specifics of what happened that day whether or not noa deserves to be on death row they both know that she was put there for the wrong reasons marlene sends her lawyer oliver to speak to noa who begins telling her story from the very beginning when her mother dropped her as a baby which is kind of funny in the black way that noa sometimes laughs at things if only to avoid crying about the way her life has turned out this is a mystery novel but it'd be more accurate to think of it as a tragic life story that led to a murder and a death sentence at ten months old i'm rather sceptical about the idea that noa has memories from such an early age but whatever noa's mother accidentally dropped her from the top of a second floor stairway too embarrassed to admit what happened she made up a ridiculous story about an intruder and proceeded to wreck noa's crib and the house as evidence for her lie in true freudian style noa repeatedly looks to her past to explain or contextualise the later events of her life this incident is mentioned several times particularly because of her mother's bizarre attempt to cover up the truth as noa has done being dropped as a baby is also the first in a long line of mishaps and tragedies that characterise noa's life she was raised by a single mother who frequently changed boyfriends she suffered a disastrous miscarriage requiring an emergency abortion that left her unable to have children she dropped out of college soon after and proceeded to do absolutely nothing with her life later noa's estranged father gets in touch with her and tries to build a relationship with her he's an ex con and a recovering alcoholic who is very obviously a relapse waiting to happen although this sounds more like a drama than a crime novel most of noa's story down to the sad little details eventually ties in to the murder the trial and her sentence a lot of it ends up being misused in the trial which seems more like a soap opera than a serious legal procedure it turns out that noa is actually the one writing the story we're reading doing her best to explain how she ended up on death row why she never defended herself why she committed murder in the first place she sometimes suggests that she's an unreliable narrator - revealing that a story she just told is a lie or leaving out important events and details - but you get the impression that if she has misled you she will eventually tell the whole truth in between her biographical chapters she also describes her conversations with marlene's lawyer oliver a sweet twenty something who unlike marlene is very serious about helping noa details about the death penalty in america comments on how the trial was conducted like the way the jury was frequently asked to ignore statements from witnesses or how she was demonised as a bitter barren psychopath life on death row and so on partly because noa is the author here your sympathy falls with her the confessed convicted murderer she manages to be the heroine rather than the villain even if you don't quite like her she's certainly not cute and fluffy if there is a villain of any kind it's marlene the mother of the murder victim noa says she \"had never known marlene to possess even a quarter of a heart let alone a full one\" and even when accounting for the fact that marlene is shown from noa's perspective she really does seem to be a stone cold bitch her motives for wanting to get noa granted clemency are purely selfish - she wants a means of getting the truth and she wants noa to spend the rest of her life wasting away in jail rather than being given an early escape which is a perfectly understandable attitude toward the woman who shot your daughter until you realise that this is simply an example of marlene's cruel selfishness the narrative actually includes some letters she writes to her dead daughter but these don't elicit sympathy so much as reveal marlene to be the unstable controlling woman that noa warned us about i want to make a few comments on the writing and narrative style the novel is easy to read but silver often makes attempts at being poetic that tend to be confused or just fall flat oliver actually criticises noa's metaphors at one point \"lovely noa \" he said spitting a bit of scoff my way \"taking a poetry class via the post \" based on that you could say that this style is a voice silver crafted for noa but sometimes marlene does it too another thing i wanted to mention is that a couple of chapters are little more than lists between telling her life story noa gives us trivia related to her experience at the trial an in prison - excuses people make to avoid jury duty final words of people who'd been executed final meals some of this is interesting for a short while but it quickly gets tedious without adding anything to the story it's also unclear where noa gets this information since she's stuck in prison with few connections to the outside world but flaws aside this is a pretty good read and an impressive debut novel i loved the way the main characters' psychology unfolded as the novel progressed with all their twisted issues about family guilt and atonement it moves relatively slowly for quite a while but by the last quarter or so i was anxious about how it would turn out if i'd read it in print instead of on a kindle i'd have had to stop myself from 'accidentally' glancing at the final pages and any mystery that has that effect on me has done its job for more reviews check out my blog violin in a void","397":"interesting book guilty of one murder not guilty of the other i'm reserving my review until i think this out","398":"3 stars flowery language for a serious subject i got into the story after the first 35 pgs or so noa is on death row for a murder the reader learns of the life of noa and the events of this crime as the mother of the victim explores the possibility of life in prison rather than the death penalty for noa","399":"overall an engaging story but it definitely dragged in places","400":"initially i found myself annoyed by noa's refusal to participate in her own exoneration but by the end of the book it was very clear why she didn't wanting to know what happened was enough to make me finish the book but overall it needed more editing and the characters were underdeveloped i was unattached and felt no sympathy for any of the characters i also thought marlene's letters to sarah were contrived and was not an effective method for revealing her psyche","401":"spoilers ahead a page turner for sure but a frustrating one noa's disinterest in her own life is incredibly frustrating but by the end of the book i realized it was because she was punishing herself for an accident when she was a child it doesn't make any of her actions against sarah acceptable but her lack of interest in her trial makes sense despite noa's somewhat borderline personality traits marlene is the more twisted character she's disgusting and definitely has some part in her daughter's death despite what she thinks she blackmailed people and withheld information many times thought this tale an interesting read but i found myself skipping a few lengthy paragraphs that seemed unnecessary","402":"i am really struggling with reviewing this novel because i just didn't love it as much as most of the others i've talked to who've read it have i didn't find myself connecting with this book at all i usually love an unreliable narrator but i never cared enough about noa to care what happened or why which is a pretty big deal since the entire novel is about her and what happened i also didn't love the writing style of the author which i think was part of the reason i wasn't loving this book something about her style just never worked for me i'm still having a hard time pinpointing what it was but i can't seem to identify what exactly it was beyond the ambiguous 'it's not working for me' the story itself was fine nothing earth shattering or particularly compelling but it was ok maybe i've been spoiled by other novels that gave me more novels like gone girl for example i'm not sure i just know that this one didn't work for me unfortunately this isn't a novel that i can recommend however i will point out that plenty of others have really enjoyed it so if it's appealing to you it's worth a shot since so many have liked it quite a bit sadly i didn't love this particular novel as much as some others have","403":"noa's voice here is unflinching and i was immediately drawn into her story i was really surprised by the events in this one excellent writing","404":"i don't get why this book has an average rating of only 3 33 stars i really enjoyed this and i'll write a review later","405":"3 1 2 stars so much better than i expected","406":"well written i didn't expect the ending even though the whole story pointed that way would be a good launching point for a death penalty discussion","407":"this was not my favorite i found my response to the main character completely opposite from the reactions of the other characters in the book while they kept mentioning how wonderful and intelligent the narrator is i found her to be dull rather petty and highly self indulgent more than anything else this novel made me thankful that i am self aware enough to have a therapist all of the characters in this book could have used a good one after finishing i actually re read the last chapter because i thought there must have been something i missed to make the novel garner the amazing reviews it received but wasn't able to find anything that made the choices of the narrator understandable sympathetic or intriguing","408":"it was an addictive read that i could not put down i think it's mostly because of my strong passion regarding the death penalty although fiction i felt really connected to the book and its characters","409":"the ending was a bit of a let down i felt like there was a lot of build up throughout the book to the secret and subsequent actions and it just wasn't as exciting or surprising as i was hoping for still a good read though","410":"this debut book is excellent started and finished in one day wanted to speak to the author and thank her one of the best books i have read this year","411":"decent book took a bit to get into as they sort of tell the story backwards","412":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i have to say i enjoyed the first half of this book more than the second half the whole book leads up to the revelation of why noa killed sarah and it is pretty underwhelming the whole time she is in the apartment i just kept thinking why don't you just leave killing sarah just to keep the secret of what noa did to persephone seems like a lame reason to kill her there was such build up to this plot point and i just don't feel like it payed off i realize that her actions were supposed to i have to say i enjoyed the first half of this book more than the second half the whole book leads up to the revelation of why noa killed sarah and it is pretty underwhelming the whole time she is in the apartment i just kept thinking why don't you just leave killing sarah just to keep the secret of what noa did to persephone seems like a lame reason to kill her there was such build up to this plot point and i just don't feel like it payed off i realize that her actions were supposed to be influenced by her upbringing but i found that i just didn't really care about her sarah or what happened to either of them i also didn't care about marlene i felt no sympathy for her at all and i felt that she was kind of a villain in the story since her actions essentially put everything into motion more","413":"this was interesting but i wasn't quite satisfied noa certainly was a compelling narrator but parts of the plot didn't make sense to me maybe that was part of the point that the real tragedy of murder is that there is no reason for it","414":"ehhh only ok ending was a let down at times in the first half of the book it was a struggle to plow through story moved slow","415":"the execution of noa p singleton jennifer silver's first published novel is my third book from goodreads first reads program i was happy to receive the copy and excited to read it the execution of noa p singleton tells the parallel stories of noa who is imprisoned and sentenced to death for killing a pregnant woman and the victim's mother marlene who reaches out to noa offering a possible clemency noa though not particularly interested in dying is also not interested in giving the information which might allow her to live a significantly longer life the majority of the book is told in first person while shorter portions at the end of some of the chapters are letter written from marlene to her deceased daughter sarah from the beginning we understand that noa is a difficult person and an unreliable narrator which contributes to the tension created by her reluctance to be honest with marlene and the young handsome attorney oliver however at points noa's narrative is less like an unreliable narrator and simply confusing usually the point of an unreliable narrator and to an extent all narrator's are unreliable is that they are unable to tell the truth whether from denial fear ignorance shame or a combination of the four characters since they are based on real life human beings will of course do a certain amount of censoring just as writers must pick and choose which details are important enough to include however noa's opinions on things especially in the present tense of the story when she interacts with oliver and marlene is fraught with her claiming to feel a certain way in one paragraph and a completely different way in the next first she wants visitors then she does not this kind of ambivalence could work if the reader were privy to the reasons why noa vacillates so much but the story is not clear on this the epistolary device also does not seem to reach its full potential marlene dixon as a mother advocate and generally as a manipulative human being is quite fascinating however her letters to her daughter reveal very little plot wise and also seem disingenuous for example at a certain point in the story marlene reveals in a letter that she manipulated sarah's former lover in a cruel way knowing as the reader does that sarah was very displeased with her mother trying to intervene in the relationship why would marlene admit this in a letter without any kind of admittance that her daughter would be furious with her it seems a strange choice to have the mother writing letters instead of having a book with a dual narration to hear marlene's point of view of the events could possibly be fascinating if it were not restricted by the nature of the letters which severely limits what marlene will say as is the letters add little to the plot or the reader's understanding of the characters while the characters and some of the writing is problematic silver writes a very promising first novel the unraveling of noa's past and her crime keep the reader's interest and carry the plot the discussion of the death penalty and the validity of it do not overwhelm the book with time silver will develop into a novelist who creates both well crafted plots and well crafted characters","416":"boy with parents like these enemies look better and better very good story of a young woman on death row who has not uttered one word in her own defense the mother of the murdered victim comes to see noa p singleton with an interesting incentive for noa to open up about the murder as is her story interesting that is right up to the last page","417":"an ok beach book better writing and more substantial characters would have helped but i did like the way the author unfolded the plot","418":" this is the story of a thirty five year old woman who has been on death row for ten years for a crime she may or may not have committed evidence points toward her but she never even spoke in her own defense during trial but is that necessarily an admission of guilt i really liked this book and the way it presents a sort of unreliable narrator noa p singleton p stands just for p or sometimes persephone after noa's childhood friend admits that she committed the crime for which she's imprisioned but the question is whether the guilt lays entirely on her i love the way the book twists the reader along with the story so you're not really sure what even happened until she finally tells her side of things much later into the book it actually at times reminded me of gone girl by gillian flynn which is a good thing i liked the twist but going by my rating you can see it wasn't perfect i think mostly what i disliked is personal preference on the ending resolution i don't need a happily ever after god why would i want that all the time but there was too much injustice in this book which actually was kind of the point so while very very well written it wasn't my cup of tea but boy did it make me hate some of the characters most of the characters the other main character who i don't really want to consider a main character was noa's victim's mother who is kind of the worst not to give anything away but she and noa both spend the book trying to figure things out what's right what's wrong who's responsible for what and in the end what's the right punishment that's great and all but man i really hated marlene noa's final verdict on these questions is quite poignant though the funny thing is who i saw as the real instigator in everything wasn't even brought up in trial or by noa later during her prison visits with lawyers that was probably most frustrating of all considering the things that happen irl in violent crime trials but as is life i suppose--another of the book's main points right over all it was enjoyable very well written an uncommon topic with an uncommon protagonist who is surprisingly relatable note i received this book for free from blogging for books for this review","419":"this was a fantastic story along the lines of gone girl unfortunately like gg the ending is a complete let down there were so many twists and turns i would have given it 5 stars if the ending would have been more satisfactory what was the author thinking","420":" part of fun of being an avid reader is discovering new authors especially when that author debuts his or her first novel thus i was excited to read silver's debut novel about a young woman on death row sounds interesting right i thought so too but as i listened to this book on audio i realized what a snooze fest the whole thing was to the point where i couldn't wait for it to be over i've noticed a trend with newly published authors who have obtained mfas in writing or a master's in creative writing the latter of which silver is a member in that these authors tend to overwrite their books by going overboard on their descriptions or they tend to fall into the trap of using bits and pieces of their writings that they did for school and try to fit them into the story i'm a huge proponent of education so i am pleased to see people earning degrees here but i feel like these programs may be focusing more on the use of literary devices rather than good old fashioned storytelling first this book is heavily overwritten to the point where i started to cringe at the level of detail and frankly the descriptions associated with such details didn't work in the story either maybe it's because the book is supposed to be a suspense thriller i'm sure that it must be challenging to create a literary masterpiece within this genre which is why most authors who write in this genre don't attempt to do so second silver uses two weird and very annoying literary devices throughout the book one which i'll call list making approach and the other the re emphasis approach silver frequently uses lists while telling the story for example let's list for the reader the last words of people who have been executed then later in the book let's list the last meals that people have had on death row let's list the excuses that people give for not being able to serve jury duty let's list the contents of a woman's purse or a drawer perhaps interesting on their own none of these lists adds anything to the story instead i found them to be disruptive to be the point of distraction one or two examples might have worked fine but the lists go on and on to the point where i found myself shouting in the car enough already silver also repeats parts of a sentence over and over ad nauseum which ended up being as equally distracting as the list making approach for example one character might say i f you cared then the other character would then say if i cared then xif i cared then yif i cared then zif i cared then aif i cared then bif i cared then cso you see i don't care ugh the foregoing happens way too often in this book the only reason that i didn't rate this book 1 star is because there is some semblance of a story here that might have been more interesting without all of the literary device distractions nevertheless i won't be recommending this book to anyone skip it","421":"a little disappointed at the ending left me wondering what just happened except noa singleton was executed for a crime and the victim's mother had knowledge that could have impacted the entire trial numerous people were involved inthis story and no idea what some of their motives were","422":"good book somewhat unsatisfied by ending but may just be that found none of the characters to be like able so wouldn't have been able to find any ending satisfactory found myself underling large swaths of this book authors insights into societal mores and ethical and moral complexities surrounding the death penalty and standing in judgement of others both criminally and in a larger societal sense were very interesting she has a good sense of human nature would definitely read other books by this author","423":"at first glance the execution of noa p singleton is a novel where a young lawyer attempts to stay the execution of convicted murderer noa through both the legal battle in the present and a murder told in flashbacks noa's life and the path that led her to death row is explained she is revealed to be a complex women full of ambitions insecurities and good intentions noa's relationships with others and how they will impact her life are the most haunting and unnerving aspect of the book every few pages the author revealed things about each character that changed the landscape of the story and the identity of the killer i found noa to be likeable even though she was convicted of murdering a young pregnant woman noa's strong personality was enhanced by the clean writing and the story that unfolded so well there were some excellent hints hidden in the early chapters about the ultimate plot twist that i completely missed which i believe was the intent of the author there were a few courtroom scenes but this is not a legal thriller in the way that a michael connelly book is instead this book focused more on how lives are interrelated and impact each other i found myself really interested in what would happen and each chapter easily paved the way for the next every aspect of the novel culminated in a great ending of course saying too much about the plot would ruin this book there were elements to this book that really made me question the intentions of humanity overall this was a thought provoking well written crime thriller i really enjoyed i was impressed with the story and really satisfied with the ending this book received so many horrible reviews online that i almost didn't bother to read it i was so glad i did read more of my reviews on my blog http fastpageturner wordpress com","424":"quick read with enough twists to keep it interesting enjoyable","425":"okay for me it was a page turner but in the end i couldn't manage to suspend my disbelief really really you did that she did that i won't spoil it but a major plot point is just incomprehensible that said it was well written and i enjoyed it up until the silly ending","426":" i recently finished elizabeth l silver's the execution of noa p singleton and i have to admit that i hate every single character but in a good way before i get to that let me provide you with a brief synopsis noa p singleton is on death row she barely stood up for herself at her trial and didn't lift a finger to help with her appeals enter marlene dixon mother of the now deceased sarah dixon who suddenly wants to plead for clemency on noa's behalf marlene wants to know what really happened or so she says and you'll soon find out she's not the only one with secrets read more so what do we have here another run of the mill crime story not in my opinion i believe the idea of executing a truly innocent character plagues many minds in the us when it comes to the death sentence noa p singleton is an interesting character she keeps secrets that would have exonerated her to protect people she barely knows but she won't help herself her father a dead beat with a dive bar who didn't make contact with her until she was in her late 20's also does not come forward to help her two women she just met marlene and sarah dixon have attitudes out the wazoo unjustifiably so as far as i'm concerned in the middle of the novel just a few months away from her scheduled execution date we are faced with a question which will change how we view the rest of the novel do we trust noa truthfully the stories noa shares with us from her past make us simultaneously sympathetic and suspicious in her opening speech to the reader she admits that her memories are starting to fade an admission which makes her an unreliable narrator further proof exists within the novel as more facts about her past unfold but back to my hatred for every character i hate them because i am supposed to this is not a case of poorly written human condition this is a book about people who need to be punched in the face with a chair silver does a marvelous job of keeping me guessing about characters' motives and intentions throughout the novel and i often stayed up late trying to finish the story faster i give the execution of noa p singleton 4 5 stars and challenge you readers to make the choice for yourself is noa innocent you'll have to read the book to find out i received a free copy from blogging for books","427":"the end was sort of anticlimactic but it was a good read","428":" this book could have been really good as someone who wrote their first college essay about abolishing the death penalty i had high hopes for this novel there were just a few problems the writing is a bit too pretentious for my style there's also the issue that none of the characters are all that likable you don't really feel any empathy towards the main character noa nor anyone else in this book the main plot in this story is not a who dun it from the very beginning noa claims accountability for her actions the question that this book seems to be asking instead is should she be given the death penalty does her odd upbringing without a father and a mother with questionable morals explain her actions or at the end of the day does it really even matter a woman and her baby are dead bad upbringing or not that fact never changes this book was interesting and for me it brought up the opportunity to not only contemplate my views on the death penalty but also think about what sentence would be a more proper fit for noa","429":"the book began well the story was intriguing kept me hooked so i finished the book during the weekend by the end of the book i felt slightly let down the book and its plot showed so much promise but by the end the energy had fizzled out a good first novel good writing also","430":"it's hard to like a book when you hate all of the characters","431":"i listened to an audiobook version and probably would have stopped reading a print copy i just wanted to scream at the main character and the author for the things she did or didn't do to help herself out of bad situations i couldn't feel much empathy for any of the characters they were an unlikable lot i guess that was the point of the story how screwed up people can become due to dysfunctional childhoods and relationships","432":" um okay i am confused conflicted and disappointed as i close the book on the last page this rush of emotions was unwarranted and unfair man i started this book with so much hope and it had unlimited potential and intrigue around it but whoa it dragged and got bogged down in words and description so much that the story fell apart this story grabs you from the start and even if i didn't want to i would have to finish this just to find out what really happened that new years eve night and why should i care about this sarcastic snarky introspective woman on death row awaiting her last day so yea that basically is the premise and you follow this author and unreliable narrator noa p singleton as she recounts her life from ten months old seriously there is a scene she comes back to often where she is an infant and yet knows all the details to the night that brings her to her last you get in her head and listen to her but again you start to wonder why as all she does is pontificate life and get extra deep as she never met a simile she wouldn't use marlene twisted her neck like the top of a soda bottle opening it's isolating like a termite scuffling up your innards huh the pearl of blood dripped onto the white duvet like a spot of chocolate \"a pale rough armor covered his mouth like scales from a striated fish a smirk seeped out between my lips like an unsuspecting belch thirteen individuals marinating in the enclosed jury box like a carton of dried out fruit his heart was too visible outside his garments where it resided like lint on a week old sweater ...i had to reference some hilarious reviews on amazon as a whole lot of people felt the same way i did for once--the author just over explained everything and it got hard to read and put me to sleep a few nights but my will made me get through it lol and i was not rewarded with a great ending man i had to deduct a star and cant really say i recommend it omg what is happening to my golden reading touch 2015 not one new five star","433":"could not put this down really a great read","434":"i was up and down about this book i found the prose cumbersome in places and some of the metaphors peculiar those facts distracted me from the plot which was at least unpredictable","435":"wow this was a can't put it down book intense conclusion looking forward to reading more by elizabeth silver","436":" hardly a spoiler noa p singleton is awaiting her execution for the murder she committed ten years earlier as this crime novel opens in sections labeled six months before execution five months before execution and so on the circumstances leading up to noa's incarceration are revealed her crime has suddenly become of interest to a young lawyer who working with the mother of her victim thinks he can build a case to prevent her execution her victim's mother has aligned herself with an organization called mad mothers against death little by little the reader learns about noa's past and her tortured relationship all of the individuals involved in her case little by little this reader tired of her as a protagonist and was secretly hoping the ending would match the title - sorry","437":"meh it was obviously a first novel clumsy writing the story is interesting but won't stick with you or keep you up at night reading","438":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the problem with this book is that it has a really really interesting premise but the writing plot and character development are truly awful i was fairly on board with the book until about 3 4 of the way in from then on i was legitimately confused by everything that was going on so marlene was just a super crazy mom with an equally crazy daughter they both had crazy eyes at some point i just didn't understand any of the characters' motivation marlene offered noa 10k to break up the the problem with this book is that it has a really really interesting premise but the writing plot and character development are truly awful i was fairly on board with the book until about 3 4 of the way in from then on i was legitimately confused by everything that was going on so marlene was just a super crazy mom with an equally crazy daughter they both had crazy eyes at some point i just didn't understand any of the characters' motivation marlene offered noa 10k to break up the relationship was noa being followed by ne'er do wells why why would her father get in touch with her knowing that was a possibility the whole story was very bizarre spoiler alert noa dies and honestly i don't really feel sorry about that i really thought she was covering up for someone but in the end she did shoot a girl in the head for the second time and again with the intruder story i get it it's a theme throughout the book a way to connect the pieces of her tragic childhood but ultimately it was just silly and unnecessary i didn't like noa i didn't like marlene i didn't like sarah or caleb i didn't really like anyone i sort of liked ollie until he played into marlene's game the main problem with this book is that it was handled by an author who tried too hard and an editor who didn't do their job correctly the author's over the top vocabulary and metaphors scream look at me i'm sooper literary and smart and really just highlighted her immaturity as an author the editor could have helped her tone it down and tweak some of the more confusing plot points but that didn't happen too bad because the book had potential at the start overall very disappointing book not even a fun summer read more","439":"noa p singleton is waiting to die because she killed someone but there is so much more to her story noa is not a girl you'll like but ultimately she is a sympathetic character her actions killed more than a girl on the cusp of life worth a read","440":"this powerful debut novel encourages and rewards re reading the primary characters i can't decide if they are protagonists or antagonists are so complex and deeply written that readers have to look around behind and through their words for a glimpse at what might be motivating them both are unreliable narrators but they are the only ones we have they don't believe each other so who should we believe i did come to feel sympathy for one of the guilty parties i won't tell you which one that's up to you to decide","441":"i loved this book it hit me personally on so many levels a great first novel","442":"in a nutshell hard to get through prose was a bit too wordy and just strange on occasion i had to go back and reread sections when i realized i was totally lost i was left wondering if i missed some huge chunk of the storyline somewhere once i finished the book","443":"the execution of noa p singleton is the debut novel by elizabeth l silver noa narrates the story as she talks about her past and what led her to death row noa is not an enjoyable character she killed someone much of the story readers are kept in the dark about what really happened the night 10 years prior to her conviction but in my opinion it's an outstanding and unique first book by the author i wanted someone to care about noa i definitely recommend this book","444":"loved this book from start to finish i highly recommend","445":"really a 2 5 good writing but the characters did not seem not to grow change throughout the story","446":"this was ok the story was engaging enough but i could have easily put it down and never picked it up again","447":"well written by very disappointing in the long run many of the characters were two dimensional and i wasn't sure why the author took us on this journey with this sad sack character if there was to be no redemption for anyone a page turner with no payoff","448":" once i had found my way through the first three chapters its' hook began sinking into me until that point i wasn't certain whether i'd be finishing the story at least for me any story that begins sounding too much like facets of my clinical years i never dealt with anyone on death row but have put my hands on a few who had either killed or had yet to kill in our client base how many of those assumptions were an expression of my bias or correct diagnostic impression at this point is impossible to tell all you have to do though is to increase the case load beyond a reasonable level across your life and you will become engaged with at least one my intrigue was feed by the evolving complexity unfortunately i am one of those who likes to chase after the innuendoes of conversation and thoughts and so the hook was working its' way into the jaw of my intrigue my clinical self began looking into the insinuations of every word sentence and paragraph contemplating what it was that noa working to distract all of us from seeing by the time i was halfway through i began fighting to finish it quickly wanting to experience the unfolding of a complexity reminding me of my days as a therapist engaged in the emergency levels of that work my being able to watch through noa's eyes those characters marlene sarah persephone and caleb kept drawing up more people in my work history none of them engaged in this level of intrigue but each was as convoluted in their own and less intriguing fashions as what i read in this book so i have to recommend reading elizabeth l silver's book keeping in mind that you are reading a skilled author who nonetheless makes you look at this through the eyes of the killer and a lawyer","449":"i thought that it was just ok kind of disappointing never seemed to get to the point","450":"great book amazing plot captivating story noa's voice is brilliant so real loved it and the writing is so beautiful that one read doesn't do it justice definitely one to reread page 9 'law school trains these junkies to masticate language as if it's gum 'page 55 ' watching a sun sit still on a solid evening hour its talons skewering the clouds beneath 'page 127 'all that she knew was the safety of living in a frame 'page 229 'it's funny how undressed a smile can make you feel '","451":"despite my best efforts i couldn't like the main character at all and the story was a bit hard to follow","452":"this book had great potential based on the premise of the story but i found the ending to be anti climactic","453":" strong 3 4 for execution whomp but 3 for my actual liking of it it was so very interesting and i did really enjoy searching for the secrets in the unreliable narration on both noa and marlene's parts but the complex human openness of the ending was hard for me to get on board with maybe because it was so real so it's by nature not going to be emotionally satisfying for the reader which was intentional and successful so...again 4 for execution but don't expect to come away satisfied very good audio if it needs saying","454":"i both loved and hated this book great writing twisted plot","455":" what a stupid book a stupid stupid book and yet i couldn't put it down i powered through half of it yesterday to find out what happened as one might expect noa is on death row she doesn't speak for herself at trial doesn't fight for herself post conviction as execution day approaches the mother of the victim has a sudden change of heart and doesn't want noa to die the mother happens to be a lawyer so that's convenient she's also a psychopath in her own right so that's also convenient she's awful noa is also awful if you are going to have your main character on death row i would think you'd want people rooting for a stay of execution i mean who wants to read a book filled with people they hate i remember bawling my eyes out at the end of the chamber because i didn't want the guy to die at a certain point i was convinced that i'd figured the whole thing out but turns out i was wrong and i have to say that was a positive maybe a spoiler but who cares basically it was an occam's razor situation end of spoiler this was an interesting contrast to the sorority which is orange is the new black which i just finished watching other than that no redeeming value i wouldn't recommend this book to anybody even though i didn't ultimately hate it it was just a complete waste","456":"compelling story and examination of the justice system and capital punishment noa singleton is on death row for the murder of college student sarah dixon and has never spoken in her own defense or even told the story of what happened that fateful new year's day sarah's mother approaches noa on death row and offers to seek clemency on noa's behalf in exchange for the truth about what happened to her daughter however the truth is complex and as the reader follows noa's story it becomes less and less clear where the culpability lies noa's life journey is gripping and you can't help but get drawn into her narrative","457":"very hard to put down really enjoyed it noa is quite a girl","458":"i'm tired of suspenseful books with unsympathetic characters i don't want to keep reading to see what happens instead i just want someone to tell me what happens so i can quit reading this one wasn't bad it just didn't make me care","459":"it certainly didn't turn out the way i had expected it to and i enjoy books that are not what they seem still after finishing 300 pages there was something that didn't feel true about it very good story well written and not the worst way to spend one's time but it left me feeling disappointed maybe it is my belief in justice of karma or what have you it didn't seem right","460":"this is a brilliantly written well paced novel kudos to the author for that and yet i really disliked it a dark book full of unlikeable characters and situations that are the stuff of nightmares quite relieved it's behind me","461":" i really liked this book i listened to it on audio so while it is relatively short it still took me a couple of weeks to finish there were times that i felt like the story was dragging but at the end things picked up quite a bit i ended up really liking noa and hoping she would somehow get out of the scheduled execution i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crime fiction but i wouldn't exactly call it a thriller it's not fast paced by any means be prepared for things to happen slowly at least until the last 50 pages","462":"an interesting concept","463":"the premise of this is brilliant i love a good death row book if done well and i was interested in reading about noa's life how she ended up on death row and whether she deserved to be there or not unfortunately i have no answers to those questions this was poorly written and confusing i don't understand i just don't 90% of this was pure waffling 10% of it had my attention until it reverted back to being waffly and confusing again i'm confused by all the relationships portrayed here every single one i can't say much else about this book if someone can explain this to me i'd appreciate it","464":"honestly i'm really not sure how i feel about this book noa was a haunting character that drew me into her world the rest of the characters however were completely unlikable it left me in a position of understanding noa completely and feeling like everyone got what was coming to them this may have been the feeling that the author was shooting for but it left me in a state of flux i was sad at the end of the book for how it ended but not because it was the only ending that could have been","465":"definitely one of my favorites","466":"i'm not sure i know exactly what it is about this book that left me dissatisfied i had the same issues with some of the author's metaphors that other reviewers here had and at times there are some glaring editing errors such as misplaced pronouns that make some of the dialogue confusing to follow i felt like often insignificant things were given importance they didn't ultimately have or as if the narrator was giving dramatic foreshadowing to things that never really came to pass i suppose part of my dissatisfied feeling is due to some of the unpleasant aspects of the story such as the fact that it seems that just about everyone in noa's life lets her down abandons her or is willing to throw her under a bus for their own selfish desires or needs the other thing probably coming into play is the fact that while noa is not innocent and does not claim that she is there are certainly plenty of other guilty parties throughout the story who never receive any kind of comeuppance for their various misdeeds and shortcomings or their own part to play in what goes down i suppose that is realistic though i'm also a bit mystified that noa claims that despite its flaws the justice system works when her own trial is a total disaster and even after oliver digs up and formally presents the many missteps from noa's arrest through to her sentencing all of them are deemed not serious enough to grant her any kind of retrial or clemency all of which noa is aware of and tells us about herself i'm also never sure where exactly noa's apathy towards her own fate comes from and particularly in the scenes where we see her interact with sarah her character seems very inconsistent in the end i feel like there were a lot of interesting possibilities here plot wise and character wise that never quite get fulfilled and i'm left with a sort of what was the point feeling","467":"one of my favorite this summer","468":"\"injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice\" a quote on the opening page by h l mencken not a feel good novel but an impressively written debut the sentences strung together in poignant and insightful prose the subject matter however is disturbing a young woman on death row incarcerated for the last 10 years for murdering a pregnant young woman involved with her biological father she never once spoke out in her own defense the mother of the victim marlene dixon esq and her budding assistant attorney approach her 6 months prior to her execution to assist them in pleading for clemency in her case as ms dixon states she no longer believes in the death penalty throughout the novel one wonders if noa p singleton is really guilty is she not defending herself because she feels she needs to pay for past mistakes in her youth she handled an accident with her best friend as a young panicked pre teen might very well do unfortunately it sets her on a downward spiral for the remaining years of her life at times you had to wonder about her stability she didn't have a good home life her own mother neglected her and her biological father doesn't come around to get to know her until shortly before she is incarcerated she would have been better off without him in her life this is written in little snippets of past and present acquainting us with noa at various parts of her life and in her relationship with her parents brother and best friend she was smart sensitive and actually quite like able we readers start caring about what is happening to her and wish she had spoken up to defend herself we wonder how intelligent women like noa could find themselves on death row and we feel frustrated by the inadequacies of their defense teams i didn't like the over bearing marlene dixon or her posthumous letters to her dead daughter i for one didn't find the victim very like able either i loved ollie her assistant and his dedication to finding out the truth as well as the respect and support he gave noa i would have liked to see his character developed even better the writing does bring about a lot of emotion the injustices in our justice system is indeed frustrating ms silver is on her way to becoming a truly accomplished author this first effort lacked a little bit of flowing quality in some areas as it jumped around but it is a novel i won't easily forget and will recommend to those who can stomach the reality of death row","469":" 3 75 starsi really had to sit and think about how i would rate this book for a good hour before i even attempted to start my review i'm angry at the characters in the book at the ending of the book itself and i guess how the legal system can be manipulated by those who know how to manipulate it noa singleton is acerbic sarcastic and more than a bit jaded the ten years she's been in prison didn't cause that however she's been that way her whole life with just a few months left to live on death row the person she least expects to see in the world visits her and begins to fill her mind with thoughts of clemency the reader is transported back to the events that led to noa's incarceration through flashbacks and letters the book's blurb gives you the impression that maybe you as the reader shouldn't necessarily be believing every part of noa's tale but i don't know i guess i'm an optimistic reader and i didn't feel that anything she said was less than truthful did she have it in her to lie absolutely after sharing parts of her childhood and her relationship with her mother it was definitely not something i would put past her but why would she lie with only months left to live again i don't know there were parts where noa did certain things contrarily just to get a rise out of people so i guess i'll be going back and forth on this for a while nearly every character had something to hide and every character evoked a strong emotion for me i could have slapped noa myself for making such stupid decisions and just basically not speaking up in her own defense maybe she had given up a long time before this was certainly insinuated in the final pages of the novel even though the reader is told so much of noa's life we never get a full peek into her psyche and as a matter of fact no one ever did in her short life while i appreciate the author's vivid imagery i felt some of the text itself was too filled with metaphors and just kind of pretentious probably 30 50 pages could have been cut containing little non sequiturs about things of little to no importance i had the tendency to let my eyes glaze over these portions and pay attention when the meat of the story was being told i will for sure be thinking about this book for a while to come and i congratulate the author on a solid debut","470":"i adored this book i loved the character of noa who is exactly who she says she is even though we don't want to believe her the writing is excellent the story unfolds beautifully and it ends well it ends i'm not giving it away","471":"what a great read so cleverly written and unexpected to the end","472":"i admit i was disappointed this was a great premise for a novel but by the time the facts came out i kind of didn't care any more the writing is excellent and it's possible the book was just too long about two thirds of the way through i started skimming","473":"this book was okay but noa herself was so unlikable and generally kind of dumb that i didn't really care what happened to her","474":"very good debut novel the voice of the main character in particular was very compelling total page turner and i finished in 3 days","475":" i have mixed feelings about this book there were parts that i liked such as how the story of noa is revealed piece by piece i also liked the overall plot and the themes in the book i think the thing that i liked the least were the characters themselves the characters were self destructive prideful and were not nearly as clever as they thought themselves to be it was really hard to empathize with any of them which made me like the book less and less the that being said i really liked elizabeth silver's writing style and will read any future books she might write","476":"a book i finished in spite of myself i wanted to like it it was an interesting story but the writing was all over the place so many times it seemed like the characters were having two different conversations when they spoke with each other ultimately a very frustrating book that felt a little sloppy","477":"i think my expectations of this book were higher than the reality it was okay but didn't intrigue me i am not so sure i really understood the plot so well it never really connected for me","478":"pretty decent debut though i expected more from it based on some of the rave reviews","479":"wow strong writing great character development and well crafted plot it is all here read the book","480":"tragic story pretty convoluted but worthy","481":" i'm at a bit of a loss on how to review this novel to say that i loved it would not be entirely true but i did get immersed in the story its characters and perhaps even its inconsistencies there are twisted relationships that are somewhat unbelievable and characters that don't make logical realistic choices all in the guise of a legal mystery thriller perhaps a look at what we do to ourselves when we hold in a secret for so long it vanishes from our reality it would work nicely as a law and order esque miniseries what is the deal with marlene dixon is she a victim of her own guilt 4 stars because i'm still asking questions and i like that","482":"i just couldn't get past the narration it was too flat and lifeless nothing about the characters keep me enthused i was so looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed","483":"hard to believe good beach reading","484":"i really can't define this book other than to suggest you read it it is a gripping novel and held me throughout i can't say it's satisfying but it has a message and is a great first novel","485":" i received a free copy of this book thanks to goodreads first reads 'the execution of noa p singleton' was one of those books that you think you know the ending part way through but it takes a twist and shocks you i assumed noa was innocent of the murder she was incarcerated for and i was wrong well sort of noa seems to be a nice person who just gets into crazy situations out of her control as you read along you come to realize that she just makes bad decisions this was most likely taught to her by her mother who once dropped her down some stairs then faked a burglary so she wouldn't get into trouble the mother of the girl noa killed marlene dixon visits noa in prison and states she no longer believes in the death penalty she has a man named oliver talk to noa and try to seek clemency near the end you find out exactly what happened with sarah dixon and also that the 'p' in noa's name stands for 'persephone' her childhood friend who she accidentally shot and then covered up by faking a burglary this book was a really brilliant read enough action to keep you very interested and a whole lot of things you didn't expect definitely a must read if you like this genre","486":"excellent but sad book","487":"a very well written book a page turner and quite compelling that being said i am not sure how i felt about the ending i wanted more o a resolution but if seemed to end with no point to it all but i would recommend this book as i enjoyed reading g it","488":"pretty good thriller about a woman on death row for shooting a former classmate and why she did it if she even really did it and all the twists and turns along the way entertaining read and the main character noa was intruiging","489":"the beginning of this book was really excellent and mysterious it was a page turner to try and figure out what happened as the story began to unfold i found it a bit less intriguing but it was still a good read","490":"what a ride a woman on death row with just 6 month left before x day just may have a chance to be saved by the woman who she murdered's mother what a ab fab idea for a novel and noa and marlene completely flawed characters that leap off the page like no others just pick up this book and read it elizabeth l silver is an author to watch","491":"you can read my thoughts here","492":"i wish i could say that i liked this book more than i did it started out so strong but then fell apart towards the middle snd the end left me disappointed","493":"started out good but fell flat at the end was expecting more","494":"dark story of guilt and innocence involving a young woman condemned for murder who is keeping secrets and a mother of the deceased who has the power to secure her clemency the writing is good and the characters fairly well developed although there isn't a lot of interaction between them in this story","495":"holy cow that was like slogging through mud such a struggle only finished because i did want to know what actually happened i never ever like books where i hate all the characters and that was the case here so disappointed","496":"interesting take on guilt and innocence plus a nicely written plot which plays out well","497":"i regret finishing this book the plot was such that i wanted to know what happened and there is somewhat of a twist towards the end but it was poorly written and not entertaining at all too bad i'd been looking forward to this one","498":"three and a half stars","499":"great writing i would read it again","500":"i've written and torn apart this review so many times that my head is spinning it's really difficult for me to talk about the execution of noa p singledon as even a few days later i'm still unsure as to how i really felt about the book and still don't know if i actually liked it thankfully after scouring goodreads i know i'm not the only one in this position elizabeth silver's debut novel left me with mixed feelings from the start i had trouble getting into the book i found noa's voice to be slightly wonky and odd if not even stilted i had a hard time really relating to or liking any of the characters - the only exception could have been ollie though he was close with his grating innocent naivety i didn't dislike the execution of noa p singleton but i didn't overly like it either there were some really clever bits to the story and the way it was told in particular the significance of noa's middle initial i think the death penalty in the usa is a relevant hot topic at the moment and is very interesting i like what silver set out to do with this book but sadly it just fell a bit short for me","501":"as you would expect this is a complicated story there are lots of twists and turns and lots of memories a good summer read","502":"brilliant loved it i loved noa although at times i was a bit blah i overall loved this book so much i know it is going to be a huge hit for 2013 noa killed sarah but why when noa has exhausted all of her appeals and she is waiting on death row she can only see 2 people one being an attorney oliver and the other being the mother of the victim marlene marlene says that she doesn't want noa to die she wants to know why noa killed sarah so she says she will help noa not be executed if she will tell her why told in such a haunting voice i loved this book i'm scared what words noa spoke so bloody brilliant you must read this amazing book so different from what is out there these days not a book to just blow through must take your time with it and you will ponder it long after it has ended happy reading","503":"this would make a good read for discussion book groups moral dilemmas galore and a discussion worthy ending we may do this one next year","504":"i'm not sure if it's because i'm binge watching orange is the new black right now but i really loved this audiobook when i needed to download a new book quickly and didn't have time to search i just borrowed this because it was saved in my overdrive wish list i didn't even know what it was about but the narrators were really great and i got sucked in to the story i would definitely recommend it to others","505":" thank god i got this book from the library i would have been irritated if i had paid for it it is not horribly written but it is over written too much straining for constant metaphors it becomes distracting perhaps that comes from being a first time writer i don't know if silver is but this just has the jejeune amateurishness of a first timer and a better editor would have helped the characters virtually without exception were unappealing it is hard to read an entire book where you don't relate to the characters the plot was somewhat clever with a twist in the end i thought the premise was intriguing which is why i read it and kept going all the way through but this wasn't enough to compensate from the unpleasant characters and overblown prose","506":" the execution of noa p singleton is a novel about a woman sitting on death row awaiting her demise once a very accomplished scholar - salutatorian of her high school and with a full scholarship to the university of pennsylvania - she left college after one semester noa is accused of killing a woman named sarah her father's girlfriend throughout the trial noa said not one word in her defense ironically sarah's mother a vile and manipulative woman starts an agency called mad - mother's against death and offers to help noa appeal her death sentence in exchange for life imprisonment she has an assistant who works closely with noa and noa's life emerges in the course of the book leading up to the point of the crime the book is a page turner but there is something missing i was not excited by the goings on and did not feel like i really knew noa despite the ten years that she languished in prison and her life story that she tells to the attorney we learn about her father who deserted her when she was an infant and is now in contact with her he owns a bar called bar dive and has worked the twelve steps to become straight and clean noa's mother is a failed community theater actress who neglected noa for much of noa's youth the story flows but does not excel there are no grand disclosures or mountains that made my heart leap nor did i get any special moral or ethical messages from the writing what i got was a page turner that was interesting to read and kept my attention for two days","507":"an interesting take on the who dunnit but not in love with the ending","508":"this book reminded me of a slow descent from the top of a tall mountain traveling down steep switch backed roads as the story slowly unfolded my perception of the characters swaying to and fro as the mysteries were unraveled and when i arrived at the bottom my view was utterly different than it had been at the top","509":"i finished it hoping that something exciting or at least interesting would happen but sadly no","510":"engrossing novel with superb narrator i was engaged from start to finish looking forward to hearing more from silver as well as discussing this great novel with friends as they read it","511":"solid plot but the narrative is bogged down by too many metaphors and similes two voices both of them pulling every conceivable metaphor out of every situation slowed down the story left me wanting less talented writer i'm sure but needs to kill her darlings","512":"this was a very engrossing book i read it pretty fast in 3 days the most interesting character is noa herself she is the narrator of the book this book falls into the genre of the unreliable narrator at times she is both contradictory and confusing however on the whole it was an engrossing read and one that gave the reader food for thought","513":"compelling and hard to put down very good engrossing book with a twist","514":"i kept hoping that i would feel some sympathy for the character noa i never did and had a hard time finishing this book i will say that the writing was excellent i just had no liking for any of the major characters all very self serving people especially marlene dixon the victims mother","515":" this is a bit of a round up from 3 5 stars there is a lot to enjoy about this book the publisher's summary referenced lionel shriver and there is a similarity particularly in silver's protagonist who feels absolutely no need to have anyone like her she is certainly one of the strengths of the book though sometimes one of its weaknesses as well who is this mellow about serving 10 years in prison no matter how you feel about the crime you're there for if noa remains somewhat inscrutable the story definitely benefits from the kind of piecemeal flashback heavy storytelling that seem to be gaining popularity gone girl before i go to sleep and i'm also reminded of every contact leaves a trace another upcoming mystery if it's a device i'm tired of at the moment i'm writing this review it's still one that keeps me eagerly coming back for more when i'm in the book apparently it's my reading kryptonite as i read i felt pangs of envy at the constant twists and turns the slow rebuilding of the puzzle pieces of the past silver put together full disclosure i'm also jealous of silver altogether for a first novel this is pretty darn good and she's only a year older than me and she's also a lawyer and i definitely would've been proud to have written this book i really need to get on the ball it's a dark book but not disturbing its prose is usually unnoticeable generally a good thing though silver has a habit of getting lyrical at the beginning of each chapter and this did more to pull me out of the story than keep me in it the ending was not totally satisfying but how often is that the case","516":"wasn't a riveting read but it did go fast and i wasn't ecpecting the end","517":"the setup to this book was interesting inmate on death row who seems to have been wrongfully convicted but refuses to tell anyone what really happened and it kept me turning the pages but man this was overwritten to the point of distraction i guess that's what getting a jd on top of a creative writing mfa will do to you also in the end i found the story to be a little bit baffling i didn't understand why noa made any of the choices she did silver obviously tried really hard to lay foundations for noa's actions but it just didn't compute for me","518":"well written kept me interested all the way to the end","519":" i found this book to be very odd i am not sure how to describe it other than it was not what i expected it seemed like the author could not figure out what type of book she was writing was this an expose on the death penalty on how women treat one another on having a fucked up childhood on experiencing trauma there were just too many themes for my taste also i expected to sympathize with at least one of the characters and that was simply not the case noa singleton was a self deprecating narrator and annoying in more ways than one i wanted to feel sorry for her but couldn't and i hated all the other characters in the book including noa's father sarah and especially marlene however i was quite intrigued by the mysterious plot and desperate to know what happened on january 1 2003 so 3 stars for keeping me interested","520":"i found this book an easy overall good read i read it in its entirety on a 5 hour flight i found the story compelling but once the full extent of the crime is revealed i felt a little deflated parts of the crime seemed a little far fetched it also seemed a little far fetched that noa would actually have received a death sentence overall i found the characters mostly believable and the story interesting enough that i kept reading a good book but nothing overwhelmingly thought provoking or exciting","521":" i need to stop getting swayed by those reviews that say this book is this year's gone girl none of those have been true opi like the alternating between noa's present time in jail and her past as we the reader try to figure out her motive and what exactly happened noa is also an appealing narrator by the end of the novel i could see some of the reasoning for her actions but not completely so i don't think the supporting basis was quite fleshed out enough i also didn't like marlene and her portrayal fell short there are letters written by marlene to her daughter and i think they were partially meant to soften marlene's edges however those letters didn't feel authentic they didn't quite line up with what we see of her character's actions and the voice of the letters didn't seem to match her or wasn't in a realistic enough voice so they dragged the book down a bit luckily the majority of the book is noa centric overall enjoyable enough and a pretty speedy read but i do think with some tweaks this book had a lot more potential that it didn't quite meet as is","522":"i give this 3 5 stars very well written and the need to know the whole story kept me reading but there was just something missing with the characters and how it came together","523":" elizabeth l silver has written an exceptional book it needs to be read and absorbed into the mind of the reader the story traces the final months of a person on death row the beginning and the end are a million miles apart each part is another diamond on a tennis bracelet noa p singleton is waiting for the final appeals to be processed and the mother of woman she was convicted of killing has arrive at her prison with a young lawyer and the announcement that they will work of a plea of clemency this would not free her but it would keep her from the death penelty they strngly oppose the novel is contained in the published book but the story goes on and on inot the dreams and thoughts of the reader","524":"lots of layers right up til the end","525":"i couldn't put this book down sat up all night finally finishing it about 1am beautiful narrative the author obviously loves words and i was delighted by the language","526":" noa p singleton is an inmate on death row where she has been awaiting her execution for ten years since being convicted of murder but six months before 'x day' she is visited by marlene dixon the mother of her victim sarah marlene claims to have formed an organisation which opposes the death penalty and believes noa should continue to be incarcerated rather than face execution however to have a chance of clemency noa has to recount every detail of her crime a story she has always refused to tell even at her trial i wouldn't say i thought this was a bad book but in the greater scheme of books of this type mystery crime quick and easy but not necessarily light reads stories told partly in flashback it didn't stand out and i didn't find it at all memorable i almost gave it a rating of two stars but i normally reserve that for books i finished but overall didn't like i don't think i felt strongly enough about this to state that i actually disliked it but it had quite a few problems the story is told by noa who narrates the book in a wry voice there's a lot of humour some of which for me didn't quite fit with the character or circumstances partly because of this i wasn't keen on noa and wasn't that bothered about whether or not she escaped her fate but i certainly wasn't on anyone else's side and not only did i dislike the characters i didn't understand or believe in the motivations for anything they did there were times when i found this such a confusing story not because it was particularly convoluted not because it was awfully written but because i couldn't figure out why everyone was making such weird and terrible decisions this was especially true with regards to view spoiler marlene i found it difficult to believe that she would have approached and bribed noa in the first place or that she would have ever had a 'change of heart' no matter what her underlying motive might have been hide spoiler as always with netgalley books i should point out that i read an advance copy so mistakes i spotted might have been corrected by the time it's actually published however i can't ignore the fact that there were numerous points at which it really seemed the narrative wasn't making sense paragraphs i had to go back and read a number of times to figure out what they meant and apparently misplaced words eg the word 'palatable' being used where it didn't seem to fit but 'palpable' would have i know this review sounds really negative and i didn't mean to be quite so critical this is a well told story which held my interest as well as providing a few twists and surprises when the final reveal came it wasn't what i expected and i don't think i could have guessed it however looking back on the book i'm finding it easier to remember what was bad about it than what was good it's readable but i can't recommend it as any more than a throwaway read and i kind of feel a story about a woman's execution should be more memorable than that","527":"i was engrossed in this book from the moment i picked it up it was well written and thought out i couldn't decide what i wanted to happen to the main character she was after all a murderer but i couldn't help feeling compassion for her and ended up rooting for her","528":"this debut novel has a unique and interesting plot noa has been on death row for 10 years for the murder of sara 6 months before her execution date sara's mother a high powered attorney comes to see her to tell her she is going to petition the governor for clemency a young lawyer who works with the mom gets involved in the case and sees cause for appeal noa has said nothing about the murder to anyone and would not testify at her trial the story is told mainly through noa with some great descriptive writing","529":"great plot writing and characters filled with lots of tension and clever ending","530":"about a 3 5 liked the ending and the structure of the book book had interesting things to say about good and evil and the death penalty","531":"noa p singleton is on death row for murder the story begins 6 months before her execution date when the mother of her victim seems to offer her one last hope for clemency as the story unfolds we see the complicated path that led to the crime and we slowly come to understand noa's character it's quite an interesting novel and very unusual in the way the story unfolds a unique reading experience","532":"it was a very interesting book quite enjoyable for the story of a girl on death rowwell done and a very different idea the story is told by noa as the days pass waiting for her execution on death row for committing murder she goes back and tells her life story and feelings about where she is and how she ended up in this predicament i think the concept is clever and is very well carried out well the more i think about i would like to at least give it another 1 2 a starit was very clever","533":" um yeah this book full of suspense the main character noa is a woman on death row for a murder that you are sure she is guilty of but by the end of the book you realize there is guilt to be spread around so while you realize noa must pay for her crime you get the feeling that her bill is a little too much to pay while others kind of do a dine and dash everything is revealed bit by bit so i spent a lot of the book wishing for more information and then when i got it i became angry at the actions and choices characters made they were all so stupid i mean if there was a decision to be made an action to be taken the characters always always choose the more of two evils instead of the lesser in the end it was a good premise and the characters were interesting but i just didn't feel the motivation each had for doing what they did perhaps had they been a little more developed i would have understood and sympathized more but as it stands i spent a lot of book book wondering why would you do that","534":"mildly entertaining once you get through the beginning drudgery","535":"oh look another wannabe gone girl it's not gone girl i did like it probably 3 5 stars but i'm starting to wonder if anyone knows how to write an ending anymore cuz this was yet another disappointing ending","536":"very slow lots of rambling slogged my way through and hated it","537":" unfortunately i don't have anything new to add to the discussion of this book almost every review of this book mentions the metaphors oh the metaphors i imagine that reading this book is kind of like being a high school creative writing teacher i am surprised that a publisher allowed all of the metaphor similes other literary devices i can't remember the names of and drawn out flowery descriptions it certainly didn't add to the novel i find it very telling that despite all of this descriptive language i did not have a clear picture in my mind of what the characters looked like typically when i read i have a mental picture of all the characters scenery etc the author spent pages and pages describing ollie but the best i could come up with was that british guy from the daily show and i do not think that was her intent another oft repeated criticism of the novel is that the actions taken by the characters make no sense i tend to agree i was very patient with this novel - i kept waiting and waiting for it to all be tied together in the end and it wasn't i was very disappointed i said from the very beginning that this book had a gone girl feel besides the obvious \"twist\" and not so much a twist in this book but a slow turning the book is narrated by 1 an unreliable narrator well actually 2 of them and 2 someone who may or may not be a sociopath silver had such potential with this novel's premise and i wanted to like it but i couldn't","538":"good prose but confusing plot don't try to read it when tired i'm not a big fan of the big reveal with an unexpected twist if you are this novel is worth your time","539":"3 5 stars maybe 1 too many background stories u0026amp not quite satisfied with the ending a good read that i finished in a day u0026amp a half","540":"somewhat a page turner but lacking in the end confusing writing style hard to say if the author left you intentionally to ponder meanings or if it was just her style characters not well drawn even the main character whose life story we hear is lacking who is she really also some story elements that don't add up","541":"enjoyed it lots of twists and turns i was not satisfied with the ending","542":"i liked this book until i got to the end","543":"interesting book held my interest but wasn't what i expected not sure i liked the ending","544":"interesting premise and a different way to look at the criminal justice system","545":"a gripping psychological thriller different in that the crime has already been committed a young woman sarah has been murdered and the woman who's been tried and found guilty noa does not plead innocence several months before the date of her execution noa receives a surprise visitor marlene dixon high profile attorney and mother of sarah her professed motive is to launch a clemency campaign to prevent the execution of noa complications arise when noa's father whom she's never known tracks her down and becomes entangled in the lives of not only noa but the dixons that ultimately leads to tragedy this is a clever novel where no one is quite as they pretend to be","546":"a very compelling voice and plot could not put it down but there is also some distractingly stilted prose","547":"poor noa p singleton is on death row all appeals failed six months from execution when lo and behold the mother of noa's alleged victim marlene dixon--the woman who was instrumental getting noa the death sentence in the first place--shows up wanting to file a clemency petition on noa's behalf noa is suspicious of marlene's change of heart but a young lawyer working for marlene convinces noa to open up somewhat to assist in the clemency petition thus the ignition is turned on the machine by which we will find out the truth about noa's crime the problem for noa's lawyer and silver's reader is that noa will never truly open up or engage in her own defense it was a problem at noa's trial too where she was convicted without putting up a fight you never really like noa because a she's guilty or b she's an idiot silver does a good enough job bleeding out the oh bad pun details of the crime to keep it kind of interesting but the story would have been better if noa had openly engaged with another character the reveals happen only within noa's head which might have been okay if noa was a thoroughly fascinating character but she wasn't now the real reason noa is on death row which involves noa's past and her mother was fascinating and the strongest part of the book but this back story didn't make the present noa someone you sympathized with another strong point was marlene's possible involvement in the crime which hinted at noa's innocence this kept the story interesting far more than its main character however i disliked silver's use of \"letters\" from marlene to her late daughter to tell parts of story unavailable to noa's first person viewpoint these weren't letters just third person pov shifts in italics silver does a nice job painting a picture of a certain person on death row thankfully without neatly tying up every single loose end noa doesn't stand for any particular class or type of death row inmate she's just who she is go into it with that attitude and execution is a satisfying read if you start thinking it will be a whodunit or a debate on capital punishment you'll be disappointed","548":"read 10 2013","549":"my review college libraries do not group books by letters but by subjects and eras end of review","550":" two things were interesting about this book the clever way the author reveals the past stories of the characters primarily noa sitting on death row for murder while entwining the clues found in the present and the plot itself was inventive but and it is a big but the author's writing tics were positively annoying first she overused metaphors with almost every sentence ending with like a insert noun verb adverb then there were repetitions i finally had to skip ahead every picture of the victim presented in court one by one every item in an apartment every phrase from the mother's performance over and over again i felt that a good editor was needed to chop out pages finally by the end i still did not understand the central character surely she was wounded by her upbringing and perhaps being dropped as an infant but this otherwise insightful and very intelligent woman continued to make very stupid decisions at key points of her life and how unlikely that in her whole life there was not one person who could reach out and help her a long long slog through misery","551":"read this in 2 days very subtle messages here interesting characters great flow can't wait for the next one","552":"still not sure why the characters were motivated to do what they did but an interesting character study","553":"very enjoyable read it could have had a bit more substance and the conclusion was a bit of a letdown however it kept my attention and i would absolutely read another book by silver","554":"noa never denies that she pulled the trigger and she's credulous about the victim's mother's change of heart with good reason as it turns out the story never quite explains the cover art but the narrator is interesting the story twists and turns are well connected and i like the big reveal you never know all the light and shadows of a story and silver includes two narrators to help cover a couple important angles silver saw her single narrator pov's limitations and found an effective way to overcome some of them it's an easy read but not a life changer","555":"this was a very interestingly woven story i wasn't sure where it was going i was afraid it was going to be preachy about the death penalty and it did not the story centers around noa very bright and very flawed her narration from death row was captivating i think for the most part i had compassion for noa i think the story fell a little flat when it came to her family towards the end of the book i would have liked to seen an interaction between her mother or her father","556":"this book isn't about a pleasant subject noa is on death row in pennsylvania after being convicted of murder is she really guilty will she be saved without giving away anything there are twists and turns in the plot that i didn't anticipate but looking back they all contribute to an unforgettable story do yourself a favor and don't read the ending first which i tend to do at times enjoy every page","557":" it's six months until her execution when the mother of noa p singleton's victim shows up claiming she now wants to petition for clemency and while noa has never claimed to be innocent this turn of events will prove that the difference guilt and innocence isn't always so black and white this book has the kind of opening that truly hooks a reader it's smart it's intriguing and it's clear that you're going to be in for an interesting ride it's also the kind of opening chapter that really sets the tone and gives you a clear idea of silver's voice and style i should point out though that while the pacing of the story is quite fast silver has a very wordy way of writing it's not bad but i did find myself rereading sentences quite often for two particular reasons 1 the description was so clever that i couldn't help myself and 2 on occasion i found myself lost in a particular sentence and had to read it again to visualize exactly what silver was describing i am a fan of this kind of fiction to be honest the main character in this case death row inmate noa p singleton isn't quite reliable she's hiding things from everyone including the reader there are hints about this throughout almost every chapter the kind of hints that will either drive you crazy or force you to stay up all night reading so you can find out what it is or both and once you get into the heart of the story and begin to piece together some of the details that are being laid out it becomes pretty impossible to stop reading for any reason at all overall the execution of noa p singleton turned out to be a really good read and one that i definitely recommend if you're looking for something not quite straightforward in your fiction","558":"i really loved this book it was beautifully written and told with a lot of grit it also had some great twists and turns but more importantly left you with a lot of food for thought i highly recommend it and can't stop thinking about the issues it brought up","559":"i gave up in the middle just too slow too talky just got tired of waiting for something to happen or some information be disclosed","560":" i don't know if i can legitmately say that i read it because i bailed halfway through and my reasons for doing so were strong enough to send me to amazon to post my first ever book review on that site here's what i said i wish i had at least read the first page of the book before i bought it it would have saved me time and money i would have known in that first page that the writing was nothing short of awful since i had already bought it i got about halfway through the book before flipping to the back to quickly find out what the deal was and be done with it i was actually feeling irritated with the editors the language was so distracting and jarring it was like riding in a car with a driver who has just learned to drive a stickshift earlier that day i'm disappointed because the premise sounded very good and i was looking forward to it big letdown do not waste your time or money if you think i'm exaggerating go to amazon and read the first couple of pages tell me if you think i'm wrong","561":"wasn't what i expected actually a real sarcastic style of writing","562":" this book while not cheerful by any stretch of the imagination has maybe one of my favorite narrators i've ever read the voice was sharp darkly funny and wonderfully described i felt for noa p singleton the whole time and i honestly never thought a book about a woman on death row for murder would make me laugh out loud either it was tragic but not so overtly preachy that i couldn't buy the story and it's a page turner albeit one that broke my heart repeatedly read about noa's terrible family terrible past and acidic perspective if only to find a unique character in the midst of the courtroom drama that keeps hoping for better but never truly expects it highly recommend this one","563":" try though i did this book simply did not hold my interest so i gave up about a third of the way through and decided to stop reading it first i found the writing to be very disjointed and somewhat convoluted it seemed to me that the author was trying way too hard and as such her repeated attempts to be clever witty profound etc played unfortunately as anything but the story did not flow either and in my opinion the readability quotient just plummeted through the floor i kept having to go back and start a paragraph or even a chapter again because the author's writing style simply failed to hold my interest and my mind kept wandering off while i was reading extremely unusual for me i am normally one who loses myself in a book to the point of pretty much the exclusion of everything going on around me when i fully realized that i was looking at finishing this book as a chore i had to complete rather than an activity to be looked forward to and enjoyed i knew it was time to put this one down permanently this seemed to be a good concept and i still think that with some competent editing and rewrites it could have been something far more formidable than the end result turned out to be","564":"this is a difficult book to review because discussing what i did didn't like will almost certainly be spoilery so i'm going to try and keep this brief and say that i believe this is a book that will leave me contemplating it's story for months to come i feel that the author did a great job of researching the justice system and the death penalty and therefore there are very few plot holes in that aspect of the story i think ultimately this is a moral story where one decides just how much or how little is appropriate to punish yourself for the things you do or do not do","565":"this is somewhere between 3 3 5 stars","566":" 2 5 starsi don't really know what to say about this book it was ok but there was so much opportunity for it to be so much better the title of the book pretty much tells you what you need to know but story for how noa got on death row had so much potential and it was pretty much a let down there were so many opportunities for twists and turns that the author did not maximize on i finished the book so there was definitely some element there that kept me interested but all in all i wouldn't really recommend this book","567":"very good book could not put this one down psychological drama u0026amp mystery","568":"noa p singleton snarky defensive sarcastic and supposedly guilty of murdering her estranged father's girlfriend and their baby definitely thought provoking as the death penalty is discussed and found wanting noa is a smart girl but didn't say one word in her defense she says she's guilty but of what i liked the suspense contained in these pages and the twists and turns and despite the unreliable narration noa as well","569":"this book got me thinking about what makes a person who they are what life experiences influence their later decisions the plot had some good twists i don't think that real non fictive people would act so selfishly and depraved but maybe that's because i'm naive","570":" i both liked and disliked this book which really makes me want to give it a rating square in the middle i am rounding it up slightly because i am feeling kind and i also need to give it a little credit because i felt compelled to find out the ending and because there was a small surprise that i did not expect there are so many books these days with a twist that i figure out well in advance of when it occurs in the books gone girl i am talking to you i also like the way the author fleshed out the characters of noa and her dad however i think that the book would have benefited from having more of everything more noa more caleb more insight into what was going on with oliver more marlene more noa's mom more marlene's husband more more more i was disappointed with the way that so many characters fell through the cracks and i would have liked a little more at the end of the book to fully close everything i hesitate to say more because i don't want to give anything away i felt that the author's imagery was way too heavy handed at times causing way too much eye rolling on my end i must confess all this being said i really liked the way that sarah was treated the fact that we see her only through the eyes of other characters for the vast majority of the story i am totally expecting this to be made into a movie frankly there were times when it read like a movie and i think it will be interesting to film based on the way it moves back and forth in time and considering the interesting soliloquys by noa on the legal system and capital punishment","571":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here phenomenal book i was sucked into the story almost immediately and it kept a fast pace with many twists u0026amp turns there is a decent amount of legal in this book but since it is about a capital murder case appeal that seemed par for the course i felt bad for noa and oliver and thought that they were the true victims of the story's villian marlene a horridly manipulative person who treats the law as her own personal play thing i spent most of the book wishing that she would get her phenomenal book i was sucked into the story almost immediately and it kept a fast pace with many twists u0026amp turns there is a decent amount of legal in this book but since it is about a capital murder case appeal that seemed par for the course i felt bad for noa and oliver and thought that they were the true victims of the story's villian marlene a horridly manipulative person who treats the law as her own personal play thing i spent most of the book wishing that she would get her law license revoked side note this book is actually 310 pages not 10 like goodreads has it listed as more","572":" i managed to finish this book despite finding the style or rather the voice of the narrator off putting and alienating noa's clearly a broken individual on some level but it's not sufficiently explained why if the writing were perfect you wouldn't need to know why you would just believe that for whatever reason she is broken there was something about the way this book was written that made me question everything rather than just go along for the ride finishing the book and finding out the whole story did make me revise my opinion upward hence the three stars but i was still left with the feeling that it was less than the sum of its parts to be fair i often get that feeling about books that straddle the literary thriller line i don't know if the literary aspirations compel a kind of slackness or if they just aggravate it","573":"couldn't recommend this to a friend","574":"the story was a good one however by the end i felt like i had just read a highschool paper that had to include 500 sat vocab words and the metaphors and similes as overdone and weird as the mucilagineous trail that a lonely slug leaves in the silent forest i wish i could have liked the book more","575":"this book was obviously engaging as i finished it in a day an interesting take on the death penalty how crimes are tried and on how one action event decision can impact someone years down the line i felt depressed when i finished it and the main character frustrated me at times definitely a worthwhile read just didn't feel compelled to give more than 3 stars","576":"terrific book disturbing but well done","577":"this book would be fun to discuss with a group or with another over coffee well written and with a few surprises","578":"noa committed a capital crime and is sitting on death row in pennsylvania she has six months left until execution day she is out of appeals and has resigned herself to her fate seemingly out of nowhere the victim's mother a lawyer has formed mad mothers against death and has had a change of heart in noa's case and wants to plead for clemency oliver is the lawyer working with marlene dixon trying to come up with any additional evidence in the case noa is skeptical of marlene's change in attitude at the last minute and doesn't believe she wants to help her at all but has some other motive noa holds the secret of sarah's death and refuses to tell anyone about it including her defense during her trial she withheld her testimony and didn't give her lawyers any significant help she talked her estranged father out of testifying on her behalf she has no friends receives no visitors and is contemplating her last words and the events leading up to the fateful day 10 years prior the execution of noa p singleton is a page turning thriller i finished it in 3 days whatever side of the capital punishment issue you favor this book will have you thinking and re thinking the american justice system silver does an excellent job of detailing death row in a female maximum security prison and looking at the justice system from the eyes of the accused and convicted silver does an excellent job of establishing doubt i thought this novel was smart gritty and so utterly believable that when you get to the ending you might want to scream the characters are complex especially noa and you know someone is not telling the truth yet everyone's idea of truth and perspective is different and silver knows how to play with perspective final verdict i loved it","579":"one of the best crime drama mystery novels i have ever had the pleasure of reading the execution of noa p singleton follows the story of a young woman facing the death penalty for murder as a last minute defender and the reader tries to figure out what really happened and why singleton never spoke in her own defense this story kept me guessing until the end as i tried to figure out who noa really was and what led to the crime she had committed i couldn't put it down","580":"i am reviewing this as an audiobook the narrator was fantastic and kept me fully engaged had i read this book i may have had a different review rating this would certainly fall under the overly descriptive writing category for sure and the ending well i need a few more days to sit with this book to make a final decision on whether i would recommend it or not","581":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book and could not put it down however i gave it only 3 stars because i found the ending to be quite a letdown","582":"started out a little what is this about and then i got hooked great story makes you think be warned it's the kind of book okay for me where you i go back and re read parts again just to be clear i finished it and then had to re read the last two chapters just to really wrap my mind around the ending excellent","583":"not only did the story not hold together the writing was often clumsy with awkwardly constructed sentences and figurative language that felt randomly placed into the narrative the characters are flat and in the end it didn't matter who had done what to whom","584":"no one in the book was pleasant not really except maybe oliver one of the lawyers but it was compelling and i had to find out the whole story","585":"it's a 3 5 i believe i thought the plot was fascinating i liked the psychological portrait of noa very much the neglected child grows up to be a public cynic and a secret desperately needy naif ready for exploitation it was right on the mark psychologically speaking i liked the way the author gave noa several traumatic incidents a history of neglect and a father who is a career felon to explain her disconnection from people and her self harming behavior distracting the reader until the most tragic and impactful of noa's unfortunate experiences is finally revealed along with the final unbearable betrayal the structure of live action and flashbacks was executed very well i would have wished for a bit more insight into noa's warm and fuzzy side the qualities that prompted people to love her at least for a little while and i would have wished for more or perhaps better humor to make us believe she even had a soft side i had two major gripes which made this book fall short of great i did not like the prime mover the woman pulling the strings and determining noa's fate she was like an over the top disney villain the wicked stepmother or cruella de ville who is the one i actually pictured in my mind as i was reading i also thought the device of writing letters to her dead daughter to explain her psychology and motives was cheesy and the letters verged on boring as important as they were to the story i have spent a while thinking about this book and i will remember it i feel sorry for the author in that she succeeded so well and failed importantly at the same time","586":"the concept of the book was great and the storyline had potential but in the end i never felt a connection with the characters","587":"this book is a fast read about a woman who is on death row suppposedly the mother of her victim wants to plead clemency for her so she gets life instead read it to learn her real motives and also why noa believes she deserves to die","588":"i won this book in a contest hosted by bookpage com great debut novel i enjoyed reading this book the characters were very real and not at all likeable in some parts of the novel which to me is the mark of a well written book life isn't always likeable","589":"i am so angry at this book i hate thsi so much3 5","590":" hmm i am not entirely sure what i feel about this book on one hand i acknowledge how well written it is what a brilliant page turner it is that it made me finish it in one day but on the other hand i am left going but what was it all for noa p singleton is on death row for killing sarah dixon by the time we meet her she is six months from x day the day of execution by lethal injection early on we learn that she did precious little to defend herself at her trial and has done even less to help her lawyers with her appeals so she is set to die the state has decreed it and she has accepted it but out of nowhere comes oliver stansted who is representing a organization known as mad mothers against death and who is the founder of this organization marlene dixon the mother of the dead girl it seems despite testifying against noa at her sentencing hearing marlene has had a change of heart and now wants noa to live she now believes that the death penalty is not the fair and right way to punish crimes the most fascinating thing about this book is noa she is sarcastic funny and prison has certainly made her very introspective not once during the whole book does she dispute killing sarah even when others beg and plead with her to tell more deny any involvement she refuses and seems to accept her fate why did she do it did she do it also fascinating was marlene dixon a woman of steadfast rigidity of one thing she is sure and that is she marlene is always right it is hard to say what it is about this book that left me dissatisfied as i stated earlier it is definitely well written and the author's skill with words is not to be challenged but towards the end of the book and by the final resolution i was left wondering what the whole point was mild spoiler ahead i have no problem with evil triumphing but i like for there to have been a point a logical lead up to the conclusion i did not find that here unfortunately i can't go into too much depth without giving away key parts of the book why did i give this book a four star rating despite my dissatisfaction because it is so well written well crafted and well paced that the end did not bring me the denouement that i wanted or would have expected cannot take away from my enjoyment of the road there review copy received from amazon com's vine program","591":"i didn't particularly care for any of the characters in the book","592":" i was disappointed in this book i was so excited to get to read it because this kind of book is definitely what i love to sink into however from the beginning of the story i just couldn't get into the character i didn't really like her and because of that i couldn't seem to care about her situation the other characters i didn't care for either granted after reading a chapter or so i pretty much just skimmed the rest so i could find out what happened once i read what happened i felt let down i never like when a book disappoints me but unfortunately this one did the only thing i liked about it was that it was good writing","593":"would recommend it but not a believable story","594":"full of twists and turns and cruel ironies","595":"okay book one of those that is probably better with a short consistent read rather than on and off feel like i might have overlooked some key plotlines","596":" i received a copy of the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver from blogging for books from the book jacket noa p singleton speaks not a word in her own defense throughout a brief trial that ends with a jury finding her guilty of first degree murder ten years later a woman who will never know middle age she sits on death row in a maximum security penitentiary just six months away from her execution date seemingly out of the blue she is visited by marlene dixon a high powered philadelphia attorney who is also the heartbroken mother of the woman noa was imprisoned for killing she tells noa that she has changed her mind about the death penalty and noa's sentence and will do everything in her considerable power to convince the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison - if noa will finally reveal what led her to commit her crime noa and marlene become inextricably linked through the law shared sentiments of guilt and irreversible mistakes in an unapologetic tale of love anguish and deception that is as unpredictable as it is magnificently original this book had been on my tbr pile for a while the story is told in flashbacks from noa's point of view and from marlene's pov via letters written to her dead daughter we learn about noa's childhood and experiences that in turn cause her not to speak up during the trial for her life a single mother more interested in her own life and an absent father along with other tragedies shape the person noa becomes i thought i had the plot figured out about halfway thru and i was wrong the author did a great job in the surprise ending","597":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here awesome read i just couldn't understand why noa never defended herself i know that she blamed herself for what happened with persephone but to die because of an accident from her past is just unreal to me noa was a good person she just couldn't see that in herself this book was filled with emotions for me","598":"not to give away the story i'll keep my review to my impressions the story is an interesting look into an inmate in her last months awaiting execution if i've give it four stars it's because i found the motivation of marlene unclear in fact even confusing noa's father just conveniently disappears from the scene never to be heard of again in many ways it's a captivating book but to my taste it left too many questions unanswered","599":"i read this as arc from netgalley it was a mess i had high hopes for this book and in the beginning things were very very good after about 100 pages i felt mired in heaviness of words and words and words buried perhaps the published version was tightened up and flowed more smoothly i cared about noa and i cared about the subjects and issues the book was bringing forward i'll be interested to look at this again when it comes to a local library branch","600":"compelling read with interesting protagonist and keeps you gueesing","601":"good story a bit of a twist involved just didn't grab me and bring me right into the story","602":"i loved the dark elements to this novel kept me guessing","603":"a well written story though the characters tend to be unlikable","604":"a clever well written book that held my attention but i can't say i liked the story","605":"so overwrought unsatisfying story character work here","606":"i liked this book until the end and then felt very unsatisfied i think the author lost perspective of who marlene was unless the point was marlene was lost either way it was a disappointing ending for an otherwise well written book","607":"a very tragic story of a young woman on death row for murder while the story was a page turner it was hard to have any sympathy for noa who did not seem to care that she was about to be executed nor did she seem to have any regrets about what she did","608":"very powerful story of a young woman counting down her time on death row and slowly divulging the truth of lives destroyed by terrible parenting worse decisions and desperation haunting and provocative","609":"what goes around comes around","610":"by a writer who works in the texas appeals process this book raises a lot of questions about the criminal justice system their flaws faults bad representation and people that just care so much sometimes all someone needs is support and a friend thank you oliver for being the attorney i want to be i hope that i can have a noa some day to help her not feel so alone in the world and also share the truth","611":" elizabeth l silver's debut novel the execution of noa p singleton is the kind of book that leaves the reader thinking about it long after finishing the last page as the story begins noa is on death row awaiting x day the day of her execution when marlene dixon the mother of her victim sarah approaches her marlene is a prominent philadelphia attorney who tells noa that she has changed her stance on the death penalty marlene says that she has formed a new nonprofit organization called mothers against death and she offers to petition for clemency on noa's behalf what she really wants is for noa to explain why she shot sarah during her trial and sentencing noa did not speak to defend herself she did not offer any explanation for sarah's death the story is told through narratives written by noa as x day approaches and letters that marlene writes to sarah at the same time the truth is a murky thing that silver slowly reveals over the course of the novel the idea that both guilt and innocence exist on a spectrum is at the heart of the story neither of the women is what she seems to be in the beginning and both share the burden of guilt to some degree as noa's execution draws near the reader realizes the complexity of the situation and must consider the difference between moral guilt and legal guilt this complex character driven psychological thriller will yield heated discussions at your next book club meeting","612":"this book was incredibly slow moving in the beginning so much so that i stopped reading it my pride issues made me come back after that things picked up and peeked my interest however during the scene where everything is explained it wasn't explained i had no idea what just happened or why it just happened","613":"hated this book poorly written manipulative and ridiculous no sympathetic characters","614":"really enjoyed this bookclub book i loved the way the story unfolded it was written so intelligently i may think on this one a little more and it may deserve an extra star after we meet the author more later","615":"this was a very different book story the viewpoints were different characters different and the ending was not what i thought or even really wanted to happen i enjoyed it though very different challenging makes you think what would your last meal be","616":"noa p singleton is on death row for murder a few months before her scheduled execution the mother of her victim comes to visit her noa never told her side of the story in court and this book winds its' way around to get to the truth or at least the truth known by noa the story twists and turns and doesn't end up where you think it will it's the story of how events throughout your life can impact how you react to your current situation","617":"i wanted to read this book after hearing the author interviewed on mpr i enjoyed it a quick read reinforces my fear that our judicial system is pretty flawed","618":"i kind of liked noa's cold heartless tone in the early stages of this book and was surprised to find that i was disappointed in her humanity still a good read","619":" what an utterly tragic story i think more than anything it outlined the truly selfishness spinelessness of people and how messed up people can be my strong belief that there are many humans in this world who should never be parents ever has been reaffirmed once again it all just makes me quite sad maybe i'll have further thoughts to contribute later i don't know for now though i'm just speechless i could rant about the characters and the stupidities we do for fear of throwing away our lives which we end up doing anyway i could wonder what the heck the point of marlene's supposed mad petition was i could be greatful that my mother isn't a fecking sociopath i could also say that at least noa had the decency to pay for the crime she committed when there are people like george zimmerman who are free then i wonder what exactly was the point of this entire story maybe it was just that a story nothing was supposed to change there wasn't any miraculous discovery that exonerated anyone i think that's why a lot of us who read this book feel dissatisfied this book might be fiction but situations like this really do happen in life we don't get completely resolved endings tied up for us with a neat bow like we do in books however we still expect it in our worlds of fiction maybe this book was supposed to bring home this fact to us along with how sad it is that our justice systems are this flawed all i know now is that i used to want to be a lawyer i'm glad i chose a different path in the end i can only ask myself this question when we sentence people to the death penalty how are we any better than them how are we any better than the disgusting scums of this world who took lives they had no right to take and ruined lives they didn't have the right to ruin if they didn't have the right to take lives than what gives any of us that right and how are we any better when we stop their hearts","620":"amazing book the characters were perfectly crafted in this story that blurs the lines between guilt and innocence a must read","621":"the story is uninteresting and the writing is lacking style and substance i almost can't believe i actually finished it","622":"the narrative was beautiful and the questions were immediate why was noa on death row is she guilty of the crime she's accused of who else had a hand who's the real criminal is justice ever served whether in prison or on the outside the story goes back and forth in time between what really happened and what noa allows others to see the toggling was seamless and easy to follow even when noa's reflections were brief silver is a lovely writer and does a successful job of keeping the reader engaged","623":"a couple of reviews compared the execution of noa p singleton with gone girl so i picked it up and yes there are similarities there is a crime or more than one cover up s and an unreliable narrator silver doesn't have flynn's way with language however i often had to reread passages trying to figure out what her flowery prose was actually trying to say a couple of times i think she flat out used words incorrectly that was distracting but not necessarily a deal breaker essentially this was okay but not great a book to borrow not buy for sure","624":"flew through this one and enjoyed it a great deal but wasn't sure quite what to think at the end a little unsatisfying","625":" although noa said nothing in her defense at her trial for murdering her father's pregnant fiance now 10 years later and within weeks of her execution she is visited by her victim's mother a high powered lawyer and tempted with the possibility of clemency she tells her story in bits and pieces slowly unraveling yet complicating the details of the crime and can we trust her lawyer marlene is she to be trusted writes letters to her dead daughter and these are interspersed the result is an unsettling sometimes truly creepy novel chilling in its rendition of events and their complications i like kirkus description of the story it's about legal versus moral culpability intriguing story and characters haunting tone provocative story line","626":" this was a disturbing unsettling book that kept me up at night so i'm giving it 4 stars even though i can't say that i really enjoyed it to be fair i'm not sure this book is supposed to be enjoyable it is about death after all death murder and capital punishment and regardless of where you stand in regards to the latter this book will make you think noa is getting ready to die she's been on death row for nearly a decade and her execution date is coming up at the last minute a young idealistic british lawyer oliver comes to see her it turns out that oliver is working for a high powered attorney marlene dixon who runs mad mothers against death not so unusual except there's a twist the attorney is the mother of sarah the young woman noa was accused of murdering 10 years before marlene is also the one who pleaded for noa to get the death penalty vs just life in prison why the change of heart what are marlene's motivations and what is noa hiding told mostly from the perspective of now 35 year old noa in the first person the book moves between the present with noa talking to oliver and the past including noa's unstable childhood with a single mother who was more concerned with her aspiring acting career and always having a boyfriend at the ready than her children it's from her mother that noa learned the art of deception and selective disclosure and it's this tendency that gets her into trouble we slowly learn that there's more to noa's trial and death sentence than meets the eye and this changes the way we see both noa and marlene this isn't a breezy book and i felt that sometimes the writing got in the way of the story silver overtells and some of the phrasing is clunky and heavy with convoluted metaphors in an effort to give us a raw visceral experience silver spends entire chapters running an internal monologue without much plot development even so there's a mystery here that keeps us reading what happened exactly on new year's day 2003 the truth as it turns out as is the case with most truths isn't simple or black and white but complicated and mired in gray","627":"i just finished this book and i am still not sure what i think of it it was a slow going read i felt like i was just plodding along trying to figure it out the main character noa p singleton is on death row after spending 10 years of her young life in prison all her appeals have been exhausted and she is counting down the last 6 months until she will die she has done nothing to assist her defense at the trial or during the many appeals she is obviously an intelligent young woman but she doesn't seem to have any self worth at all as the reader finishes some chapters ~ a small clue of something that happened to noa in her past is put out there in a small sentence of a few words i never felt any connection to noa i really didn't understand why she wouldn't speak up for herself i guess the fact that i continued reading the book until the end means it had enough of something in it to keep my attention but would i recommend it to someone else i don't think so","628":"a book that is totally compelling and deeply unsatisfying when i looked at the reviews after reading they are all over the board so i guess i am not alone in my ambiguity i have no idea if i would recommend it or not","629":" though not particularly likeable noa p singleton and her story are compelling complex and tragic what is the truth what is her motivation how do the lives of the other characters become inexplicably linked with noa and each other what motivates any one of us to do the things we do and how are we able to ethically and morally justify our actions i found myself drawn into the story early on and needed to know what happened it was by no means predictable nor did everything play out the way i was hoping it would i wanted to like noa i wanted to forgive noa i wanted others to forgive her i typically prefer more closure with story endings yet this somehow worked for me i would recommend this story","630":" shelfari blog the next gone girl i read this because it was on the list in above blog post i've been going through the list as i get ahold of the books this book was a surprise in that halfway through the book i'm not engaged as far as i can see all secrets have been revealed it was uninteresting and what's left to say in the second half i soldiered on a while longer hoping to get a glimpse of the payoff what made this book worth reading worth including in the list no idea and i'm setting it down to move onto visitation street plus another from the list awaits me on my library's hold shelf i see the psychological elements that gives this commonality to gone girl and the others it simply does not compell me i don't care why especially after we learn the connections alluded to in the beginning it just made me more annoyed with the mother and didn't improve the indiferrence i feel for noa fitting as she's indifferent to her own impending execution do not recommend at all","631":"i love first novels and this one is no exception an excellent page turner from beginning to end","632":"consider this to be 3 5 stars it's an interesting fairly well told story about noa a woman awaiting her execution for murder noa never denies that she deserves her punishment the story unfolds in noa's words and sometimes that of her victim's deranged mother so that we can finally piece together how noa a former ivy league student came to be sitting on death row what i really liked is that noa wasn't begging forgiveness or asserting her innocence she was there she deserved it but did she really deserve to be executed","633":"i could not put this book down the ending was not what i expected i won't include spoilers","634":"i had to push to finish this book at times it was dull","635":"a confusing testament to the power of crappy parenting this was not a very satisfying read","636":"book received by and review written for bloggingforbooks org exquisitely written and beautifully told this book was a delightful surprise noa is no common criminal that much is clear from the beginning as her story unfolds her life turns out to be both tragic and inspiring not often would i feel compassion and sympathy for a self confessed killer but it is impossible not to like noa and root for her clemency the strong and vividly penned characters in this novel are excruciatingly real marlene loves her daughter with a smothering love that many only children will recognize and understand caleb feels the regret of a wasted life resulting in him manufacturing the one he wants until it seems that he will get it then he panics oliver is wide eyed with youthful hope and the pure taste of justice even patsmith is fully drawn in my mind as she walks her own green mile far from predictable the suspense in what actually happened to persephone caleb and sarah is gripping until the end silver presents her non linear story so deftly and seamlessly that is both easy to follow and allows the story to be constructed from inside out and numerous angles the use of letters from marlene to sarah is brilliant in presenting a very complex flawed yet sympathetic character another word about the writing silver acknowledges the intelligence humor and conflicted nature of her reader the writing is thoughtful and sensitive as well as non confrontational about the very sensitive subject of capital punishment it is also witty and wry adding a bit of levity at just the right times impossible to put down and indelible in its mark this is a must read for the summer i hope silver has many many more novels in her future my personal library will boast them all","637":"i think this is one of those books that you either love or hate it didn't do much for me but i know that some reviewers really liked it","638":"i expected more from this novel based on what i had read i found it difficult to relate to the characters and very depressing it was an interesting read but not as compelling as i expected","639":"it begins with noa p singleton and her given execution date she is coming to terms with her sentencing when in steps another lawyer offering her another chance at life even if it's lived out in prison so pretty much just not being executed the lawyer is the person you would least expect as the meetings between noa and the lawyers take place you start learning the story of how and why noa has gotten to this point a lot of it has to do with something we've all been told as a child don't tattletale but noa learns the hard that keeping secrets is much more than just not telling the truth this book definitely had me contemplating the death penalty and life imprisonment it made me see things differently from what i initially perceived them to be it took me much longer to read this book than it usually would but in a good way i read and reread certain parts because it got me thinking so much it was completely engrossing i find it hard to believe that this is elizabeth silver's debut novel i will most certainly be on the lookout for any of her further books","640":"flawed characters but a compelling story not quite the amount of resolution i was hoping for but somehow it works i wonder if the author will write anything else i'm interested in what else she might do","641":"3 5 good debut novel with some interesting twists quick read","642":"i think it was the potential for a death penalty discussion that drew me to this book - i admit that i'm drawn to things that have a hint of controversy - but capital punishment is merely the driver of this novel not its primary focus noa p singleton is on death row for a murder she was convicted of ten years ago but several months before her scheduled execution the victim's mother marlene announces to noa that she's seeking clemency the reader instantly knows that noa and marlene have a history beyond the obvious and the pages that follow are an unraveling of that history the crime in question and what makes people tick what i liked most about this book is that every character including the victim was flawed i definitely found myself rooting for noa - to a point there were a few instances where i found myself saying to her \"oh honey no just no \" but felt like i was counseling a friend not admonishing evil but there are no heroes no knights in shining armor no angels among the few characters that make up this memoir style novel everyone makes horrible though arguably human decisions and there are winners and losers all around in truth i cannot yet tell which is which i would highly recommend this book for those who like gillian flynn","643":"i couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars i guess it's a 3 1 2 star good plot good character development and a real page turner the writing needs work a few implausible twists and turns but overall a good shot for a debut novel","644":"unsympathetic characters making stupid decisions propelled by flawed motivations unbelievable dialogue and weird pacing ayelet waldman gave it this raving blurb and for that alone i wanted to love it but i'm pretty sure i'll forget this one in a couple of days","645":"the main character was a mess but an interesting one","646":"this book kept me guessing until the last minute a good read","647":" this story by a narrator who may or may not be reliable is set in a prison and more specifically on death row noa singleton 35 is awaiting her day of execution after ten years of fruitless appeals and now six months before \"x day \" she is approached by yet another lawyer who wants to make one last try for clemency on her behalf noa provides her history and as she does we gradually get an idea of why she is on death row and what really happened to put her there we also learn about the circumstances of her life and how this particular lawyer came to advocate on her behalf as the chronicle moves inexorably forward toward \"x day\" we don't know until the end of the book whether this latest attempt to save her life will work or not discussion half the time i had no idea what this author was talking about her prose is perplexing affected and overwrought it seemed as if she was getting paid by the metaphor relevance be damned here are some examples of what i considered to be overly elaborate overly confusing or just over the top i can see the five silver bars three feet beyond my arm's reach they shift into double vision as ten lines of coil prison garments a staff of music \" prison garments do they have five parts or something or this nighttime scene confused spears of darkness spiked through the metal bars...\" confused spears of darkness i'm confused too about her newest lawyer ...his voice was docile as a prostrated ocean as if he had slipped from his mother's womb begging for a nonprofit position and studio apartment to match \" what exactly does that mean \"prostrated ocean\" and what does that have to do with the rest of it about the mother of the murder victim who wants to understand the crime \"she's stuck there in that 'why' scratch on her record repeating ad infinitum until i pluck the disc from its player clean off the scratch with a simple puff of my lips and hand it back to her to hear the music properly she hasn't a clue that records have been replaced with newer technology \" okay i was following until the last sentence maybe my brain needs to be replaced with newer technology... it was an anomalous tuesday night in 2002 when the phone calls started for over a week...my apartment became a torrent of moral decay ... whirls of tornadic subjugation seeped through the little holes of the telephone receiver...\" if this took place in oklahoma perhaps i could understand the \"tornadic subjugation\" bit but since it is philadelphia it sounds a bit too anomalous to me one might say or this which i think has to do with the guy speaking to her but truly i'm not sure nothing else came out despite his necessitous expectations \" necessitous means \"needy poor indigent \" okay if he is needy or has needy \"expectations \" what would that have to do with his saying more or not rather than say her saying something why can't she just speak clearly instead of trying to talk pretty someday which brings us to... the \"metaphorgeous\" phrases i think the thing i actually miss the most is watching a sun sit still on a solid evening hour its talons skewering the clouds beneath \" sun sitting still talons what and this describing her trial i think i watched from the defendant's table during every clumsy excuse melodious sacraments to my dissonant entr'acte perpetuating a system that works more often than it does not \"omg i almost couldn't take it but perversely i did want to know what really happened which of course we don't find out until the last moment so i did not abandon the book although thinking of the ending brings us to... was it worth it well let me just say it's all about bad mothers or maybe the injustice of justice or something about the death penalty - good bad i don't know i'm not really sure there was too much purple covering up the prose... evaluation this might appeal to book clubs since one could debate about how it ends if one gets that far... oh but for the food book tie in theme you could serve \"death row food\" i e everyone gets to have their wildest fantasy food note this book has gotten a lot of praise from other sources rating 1 5 5","648":" enjoyed this book especially the scenes that focus on how one lives on death row knowing that at some point all appeals will be exhausted you can't help but find yourself rooting for the main character despite her many flaws and you can't help but hope that somehow she's innocent of the crime that question isn't answered until the end i did think the book dragged about midway through but as you near the end it really picks up i won't give away the ending but let's just say it was not what i expected and that's a good thing","649":"i listened to the audio version noa p singleton had a very gillian flynn esque feeling to it it's told by two narrators noa on death row for murdering sarah and sarah's mother marlene my biggest issue was with noa and marlene neither woman had any redeemable qualities i felt no sympathy for them they were both very unlikable women who made horrible selfish choices in their lives and neither one of them seemed to recognize their own faults i did enjoy the way the story unfolded between noa's conversations and letters with a young attorney and marlene's letters to her dead daughter it was an interesting way to go back and forth from the present to the past i liked that very much however did not like the ending and the lack of resolution felt a little cheated out of some closure","650":"i started out enjoying this book but as i got further in the book i started to lose interest i can't completely explain what it was that bothered me but i got to the end and was just thinking hmm not sure about this maybe i missed something but the ending left me cold","651":"this book was good because i was unsureof the ending there were so many ways itcould have ended interesting read that included many emotions and relationships","652":"emotionally and morally wrenching an excellent book","653":"this is a pretty good little mystery portrait of a woman on death row with secrets she has refused to tell during ten years of waiting","654":"ten years ago noa p singleton committed a murder her current location is death row mere months before her scheduled date of execution noa was a bright woman who was salutatorian of her high school class and offered scholarships to college although she was raised by a single mother who was more interested in men and her own well being than noa she seemed well on the way to making a successful life for herself then something went awry noa dropped out of college after one semester and has spent her life in meaningless jobs at her trial she didn't say a word in her own defense and she has never talked about her crime or its victim sarah dixon now she receives a visit oliver is a newly minted lawyer and he is determined to save noa if only she will tell him what really happened noa isn't fooled oliver is there only as the catspaw of marlene dixon sarah's mother and the woman totally determined to see noa dead her testimony at noa's trial was probably the main reason noa got the death penalty now marlene is holding out the promise of filing a clemency motion with the governor to save noa's life if only noa will talk elizabeth silver has created a memorable battle of wills between two strong women noa is a character the reader will long remember her story slowly revealed giving the details of what really happened the day two young women lost their lives this book is recommended for mystery readers","655":"i hated basically everyone in this book","656":" 3 5 sitting on death row waiting for her death sentence to be carried out noa seems to have no interest in appeals or petitions for clemency from the beginning the reader know what she has done but not the why and not the reason she will do nothing to help herself this was an intense look at the definition of legal guilt versus moral guilt it also looks at our legal system as a whole with a very dark but witty tone slowly clues conversations feelings are doled out in increments but i had no idea and really can't see where i missed something that would have given me the answer i'm not sure how i feel about the ending i think in a way it ended the only realistic way that it could anyway it definitely held my interest it was entertaining at times suspenseful confusing and well written","657":"ok read kept me reading and fast disappointed in the great reveal kind of killed the book for me","658":"i wanted to like this book more because it has a fresh concept and view of capital punishment but unfortunately i never really had empathy or became connected with any of these characters noa is a sad person with a horrible childhood etc but none of the characters have redeeming qualities except for perhaps oliver who i would have liked to have learned more about why give this even a 3 rating because i really wanted to learn the outcome and the suspenseful twist promised ending more a whimper than a bang not what i expected for this book which has made many reading lists","659":"i loved the slow unraveling of the story and how there is just so much more going on in person's life than the obvious headline news noa is at times unlikable and i never found her narration uninteresting","660":" i bought this based on the review in entertainment weekly and i enjoyed it though maybe not as much as they did it was gripping and thought provoking i will say that sometimes the dialogue felt underdeveloped but then again the narrator has spent the last 10 years in jail so she hasn't been able to have many normal interactions i did notice a couple of typos in the kindle version but obviously that doesn't take away from the story at all it was good and the author did her research about death row sometimes it felt like the attempts at using vocabulary in a new and interesting way were too far reaching for me but all in all this is a book that could lead to some interesting book club discussions about parenthood guilt and punishment loneliness power or the law versus ethics","661":"one of the hardest ratings to decide but ultimately settled on 3 5 i usually prefer a direct timeline in a book but in this instance the back and forth enhances rather than distracts this book challenged my ideas about the law our justice system and how i feel about capital punishment it makes you think and that's what reading is all about","662":" decent but not great mystery thriller well written but the plot was a bit thin and while i didn't really see the twists coming i wasn't shocked more surprised that an adult could make such ridiculous decisions i was also a bit confused by the ending view spoiler in that marlene's final letter was so disjointed and difficult to decipher i get that she's crazy but she had not been incoherent before hide spoiler i enjoyed the perspective of a female prisoner on death row and wish that there had been more of her reflections on life inside the prison","663":"really good story with a sort of good ending about a woman who is in prison for murder and the victims mother meets with her to try to help her with appeals as long as she tells her why she killed her daughter","664":"torn on this review i was really drawn to the early parts of this book but then as it progressed it fell flatter and flatter for me that said i was engaged and stuck with it and was entertained audio writing was a bit over the top oftentimes and ultimately the resolution was weak 2 5 stars really but the nudge to 3 for entertainment value","665":"when she was just 25 years old noa p singleton was found guilty of murder of sarah dixon and 10 years later she is on death row awaiting her execution just 6 months away she has long since resigned herself to her fate when seemingly out of the blue a high powered attorney marlene dixon who is also sarah's mother visits noa and is intent on filing for clemency on her behalf aiding marlene is an idealistic young attorney fresh out law school oliver stansted marlene tells noa that in exchange for commuting her sentence she wants to know why noa committed her crime the story is told from noa's point of view in flashbacks as she tells her story to oliver she does not seem to care about saving herself in fact during her trials she refused to take the stand and defend herself noa comes across as rude and cynical but oliver seems to see a person underneath that is worth saving this was a very gripping story and a hard book to put down once i started reading but the ending disappointed me the motives of behind the actions of marlene and noa were never really fully explained but it is still a story i believe is worth reading the author is a new writer and even though this book wasn't perfect she does know how to write an intriguing story and i look forward to reading more from her in the future i received a free copy of this book to review from random house reader's circle it will be released in june 2013","666":"beautifully written though the plot gets shaky at times","667":"this book was a hard one to get through it seemed like a really good premise woman on death row finally tells the real story of her crime but something just didn't work first of all the character noa was clearly a sociopath which was necessary in keeping in line with the story but she also seemed very very flat and as a result it was difficult to care about anything she said this isn't the redeeming of a woman who knows she did wrong or even the story of someone wrongfully accused it's the methodical recollection of a manipulative woman who cares about no one even herself for a thriller the book wasn't really thrilling the events that unfolded seemed very random and it never built up enough suspense to keep you glued to the pages everyone seemed very icky in this book which isn't necessarily a bad thing given the subject matter it's just that the characters didn't seem whole enough to be able to pull off being completely unlikeable if a character is going to be awful and least make them a rich carefully developed awful","668":"it took me forever to get through though at the end the story really came together in a satisfying way i can't tell if i would have liked it more had i been able to get through it quicker unlikable characters and foggy plot made for a slow read","669":"this was a very good book very nuanced well written keeps you guessing until the end","670":"i had a lot of trouble getting into this one but once i got into it and realized the confusion was purposeful i couldn't stop reading i enjoyed every twist and turn the last third of the book unbelievable sadness and darkness there at the end i'll be thinking about this one for awhile","671":"this was a really great book had me wondering until the very end what happened","672":" silver accomplished an arduous novel for her debut a complicated and controversial subject matter on many levels powerfully written with extreme detail irresistible page turner the reader understands the 'why' but most importantly you are left asking yourself the question of 'does the sentence fit the crime ' guilt and innocence are intricately entwined leaving the heavy question of mitigating circumstances the deciding divider between the accusers guilt or innocence inside and outside factors of the law also play an import role in the overall determination of noa's actual participation along with the root of her guilt or innocence silver will capture your undivided attention with her focus on details and outstanding characterization with superb dialogue the tension created causes great angst and the reader is hooked into the novel head on memorable will leave you asking yourself several uneasy questions for quite a while after the novel is placed on the shelf excellent selection for groups providing endless discussion","673":"so far so good only into the first few chapters but i am loving it want to read one more page and then another","674":"decent book i didn't really like the main character but you aren't really supposed to","675":" this novel was a page turner a hint of suspense throughout with layers of complexity and secrets revealed over the course of the book you could never quite tell which characters you liked or could trust other reviewers have complained about her vocabulary use but i for one enjoyed silver's more literary prose which is absent from most popular fiction these days other reviewers seemed disappointed in the ending which i won't spoil but one reader for example commented but what was it all for i think silver actually ended it eloquently with an ironic subtly that was both apropos and realistic if you are hoping for a perfectly packaged conclusion with the plot wrapped up in a sparkly bow move on this novel is meant to make you feel a little unsettled and question the fairness of the events and motives of the characters i rated a 4 out of 5 for two reasons 1 i found the mother's letters a little odd they were absolutely necessary in the absence of an omniscient narrator to try to decipher others' motivations and learn of others' actions that noa is not privy to but something didn't sit 100% right with me about them 2 chapter 26 specifically the revelation of ollie's work was underdeveloped and fell a little flat to me it seemed a little unrealistic given his gusto and the piece of evidence he had uncovered and i would have liked there to have been a little more depth to that chapter even if the outcome remained the same overall though i enjoyed it a quick read and a good one","676":" noa p singleton is awaiting execution for murdering her father's lover close to the 11th hour she is visited by the victim's mother who has had a change of heart about the death penalty and wants to campaign for clemency but nothing in this novel is as it seems it's a dark and twisty suspense tale dark cynical with an unlikeable and unreliable narrator - an easy read alike for those who enjoyed gone girl and other titles by gillian flynn my only quibble was the absurd overabundance of similes in the prose can't imagine why an editor or a writing workshop buddy didn't help her weed them out because they become distracting and unintentionally funny","677":"this was a unique story with a cast of unlikable characters but i was drawn in by the mystery of what really happened to put noa on death row while the story starts as a simple murder it ends as a complex story about love punishment and how we hear and act on the echoes of distant events in our lives","678":" i thought this was an important and very well written novel it was engrossing despite the fact that all of the characters save oliver were basically unlovable even by their own mothers i loved the pacing of the plot the skillful development of each of the characters the slight twists and turns and ambles of the story i waffled between 4 and 5 stars in all honesty it is probably a 5 star novel but i really disliked the ending and most of the characters even as well drawn as they were and i just cannot give it 5 lol talk about your emotional reactions to unreal folks","679":"no spoilers here good beach read complex enough to be compelling enough credibility to leave the reader satisfied and at least a few unexpected twists","680":"elizabeth l silver's first novel the author is also a lawyer the execution of noa p singleton is about life on death row it provides a close look at a complex 35 year old woman noa who wants to get to her execution date six months away over with as quickly as possible noa reflects upon her life and provides explanations for the personal changes that come with incarceration noa's is a powerful voice full of attitude which immediately drew me into the story the situation becomes more complex when marlene dixon who i never liked nor trusted a high powered lawyer who wants to work on a clemency appeal for noa is added to the mix marlene also happens to be the mother of the young woman noa supposedly murdered hmmmmm what's wrong with the picture the plot thickened as i got further involved with the characters including caleb noa's father oliver an attorney involved in her appeal process and more...i am being cautious not to divulge any spoilers but can assure any reader a fascinating murder mystery and a \"behind the scenes view\" of the process for executing another human being for whatever reason i really enjoyed well a difficult word to apply considering the topic the book and would definitely recommend it the book was well written and the characters intriguing","681":" i won this book in the goodreads giveaway noa p singleton has been on death row for ten years although a model prisoner she is combative with her few visitors refusing to offer any explanation for the crime which led to her imprisonment as we move inexorably towards 'x day' the various episodes from her past come together to cast light on her present predicament the execution of noa p singleton is hideously overwritten the opening paragraph being the worst offender and i felt slightly on edge throughout not knowing when i would next be ambushed by an overwrought simile or piece of incoherent imagery for example noa describes her penalty hearing as 'a circus in which to turn my picture of dorian gray into the blackened canvas in which it lay' and at another point she opines those words remain always while papers and evidence eviscerate peeling into orange curls and blackened petals in the crematorium of dead documents eviscerate what noa describes how ten years of incarceration have gradually destroyed her ability to express herself so you could argue that the overbaked prose is one element of her characterization the narrative however is also shared by the mother of noa's victim and there is almost nothing to distinguish her voice from noa's i did persevere with this novel and at times i found myself carried along by the narrative but ultimately i found it hard to care about noa or her fate not my cup of tea","682":"this novel was captivating and a page turner this isn't a criticism so much as it's a comment about my own preferences but i wish it had ended differently that's all i'll say for obvious reasons very well done and shows how a cross over from lawyer to author can write terrific fiction my hat is off to elizabeth silver","683":"the story was interesting and had some great twists but the writing style was so overblown it distracted from the story at times","684":" the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver is a novel about our capital punishment system taking place mostly in philadelphia this is ms silver's a lawyer who worked on death penalty cases debut novel noa p singleton is awaiting execution for the murder of her father's pregnant girlfriend as the months pass and her execution date gets closer noa is visited by marlene dixon mother of her victim marlene dixon is a powerful attorney she promises noa that if she'll tell her why she killed her daughter she will try and get the governor to commute the sentence from death to life in prison but noa has her own agenda and marlene is somehow involved the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver is a thoughtful book which keeps turning itself upside down with new revelations about the protagonist antagonist and several other characters the book is mostly narrated by noa but the chapters end with letters written by the victim's mother to her deceased daughter the trial scenes were fascinating and the selection of the jury was hilarious but best of all the book made you think not only about the nature of the death penalty but about the judicial system as well ms silver managed to write a fascinating book told by an unreliable narrator which manages to tell a fascinating story in shades of gray there are no good guys or bad guys in the story everyone has their own demons within them trying to make things right in their own head in each chapter the reader discovers some new revelation about noa and her relationship to the supporting cast the reader also discovers noa's state of mind while on death row her acceptance to the situation she is in and her lifelong story which landed her behind bars the execution of noa p singleton is an astute story which brings up many questions about human nature and the justice system the book's dark tones and story will stay with the reader for a while after one turns over the last page disclaimer i got this book for freefor more reviews and bookish posts please visit http www manoflabook com","685":"i thought this was just ok there were too many slow very detailed parts to warrant a better rating the ending did pick up speed but overall just average book","686":"blah blah blah complain so many complaints about this book ignore most of them this is a well crafted debut novel full of searing scenes sure it gets wordy at times and goes off on tangents but the heart of this story beats true if you want easy answers or writing that doesn't make you stop and think for a bit skip this these aren't likeable characters and it ends as it should again it's a debut novel lighten up people","687":"got half way thru and decided to quit didn't like any of the characters and didn't like the author overusing similes","688":"this was one of those wonderfully frustrating books that you keep wanting to yell into for the protagonist to do something about her situation i read this in a couple of days which is rare anymore with my busy schedule but i couldn't put it down intricate plot that continued to surprise me the whole way","689":"i really loved this book it kept me guessing until the end not so much about the fate of the titular character but about her backstory an insightful look at the american legal system and who is really guilty when a crime is committed","690":"well written entertaining story but not one that will stick with me meh","691":"unreliable narrator knew there had to be a twist but i enjoyed it all the same","692":" can't decide whether to give this book three or four stars the characterization is so very well done with such depth i was amazed real people i kept thinking noa is a bright young woman who had a tragic childhood experience and two shallow selfish parents yet she grew up excelling in school and was off to college when she had a miscarriage in the library that event caused so much distress that she dropped out of school i did find that experience beyond belief for a bright individual from that point noa s life seemed to spiral downward when she meets mrs dixon a prominent lawyer who wants her help her life path is determined mrs dixon is just as selfish and determined in her own way so much so that she tries to dictate her daughter's life what happens in the interim is for other readers to determine what a read","693":"hmmm i had this lying around as i had gotten it as an advanced readers copy i kept reading other books instead of this one but put in my suitcase for this past week i couldn't put it down all characters are broken so it's like a train wreck you can't look away from another debut novel that was well done","694":" i'm not sure i understand what elizabeth silver's point was in writing this novel due to her impressive resume of a law degree and playing gopher to real capital murder trials as well as touting a creative writing degree i expected much from this story that was so intriguing by the byline what i was left with however was an essentially very hollow story that was filled with an ivy league vocabulary that the author employs to dazzle the reader into thinking she can write a beautiful and haunting novel of the injustice of justice and woe to all who come in contact with the blind lady who represents our flawed system but her aim fell short for me her writing reads very much as a debut in desperate need of maturity and polish i think her next one will be better and i have no doubt she'll mature as a storyteller because the potential is there it's just not yet developed like a partially exposed polaroid fuzzy lacking colors but definable in its content","695":"excellent writing anticipation building as we approach noa's execution date or grant of clemency","696":"brilliantly gripping fascinating and well developed lead character","697":"the premise of this book was really interesting i was intrigued by the narrator's status as a death row inmate and was prepared for a good story that intertwined mystery and maybe some psychology what i got was a story i didn't quite understand characters i didn't particularly like and motivations that didn't make sense don't get me wrong i don't need to like the characters necessarily in order to like a book i felt though that the author wanted us to identify with noa and while the reader did learn throughout the course of the novel why noa did what she did i can't say the motivations really stood up for me in all i found it strange with characters acting in ways i did not feel real people would act in life the characters didn't feel fully developed throughout the novel it is reiterated how smart noa is how she excelled in so many ways while also discussing how terrible her childhood and her parents were but these were all just kind of stated without the reader feeling like there was much investment in this character or her life it ended up being a let down all around even though it had so much potential","698":"i wasn't always sure what was happening in this book but it had a certain pull that kept me coming back i wanted to find out what happened how and why it didn't disappoint in plot and character i simply wish some of the writing had been more clear","699":"i am not sure what i expected when i started this since i usually don't read what books are about first but it was slightly different than expected silver did a great job of making you dislike characters you should feel bad for and feel bad for characters you should dislike i enjoyed reading this and found it to be a fairly fast read","700":"the worst plot don't bother","701":"i listened to the end of this hoping to find something to redeem the story and characters no this felt like a more literary version of a tabloid or those newspaper scandal stories i avoid i wished i could unread it","702":" this was a difficult book for me to read i didn't like the narrator's tone and i found it hard to sympathize with her or any of the other self absorbed characters i kept wondering about the author's intent was i meant to sympathize with noa or was i meant not to i don't usually wonder about things like this when i'm reading a book but the problem was that i wasn't entering into the book as i usually do i was observing it rather than experiencing it it's not that silver can't write--she can i simply couldn't lose myself in this story the ending was a surprise that answered some but by no means all of my unanswered questions this is the sort of book i think would work better as a movie for me anyway i would have liked it more if i had only invested two hours in it instead of a week's worth of reading time on a totally different subject what's with this new matt finish on book jackets it always feels vaguely sticky and unpleasant doesn't it","703":"silver keeps you guessing what really happened to the absolute very last page of this book well crafted suspense but not a thriller","704":"this book had a ton of hype by the indie booksellers and i really expected a lot more i found none of the characters sympathetic or relatable","705":"the writing was amazing and really drew me into the story and finding out what really happened that fateful new year's day the twists just jump right out and grab you too overall i really enjoyed the book but every character was kind of a slime ball just a personal preference but i like when there's a character i can get behind and root for that wasn't the case with this book the way the rest of the story grabbed my attention and didn't let go definitely made up for it","706":" noa p singleton has spent 10 years on death row for murder this is the story of the final 6 months of her sentence and her bid for clemency by the last person she ever thought would help her - her victim's mother 244 pages that's how long it took before something actually happened in this book please note the entire book is only 310 pages long i can't say much without this becoming spoilery but what a waste of words and disjointed thoughts i bought into the back cover \"praise\" from the likes of herman koch and katherine dunn - now i'm asking myself \"how much did those suckers get paid for those blurbs \"","707":"loved i read this book in 3 days because i couldn't put it down very interesting how things came together a must read","708":"this is a legal thriller about a 35 yearold woman who is on death row there are some twists and turns inthis book which keep you reading but it is lso depressing","709":"was expecting a little more from the surprise ending","710":"what a fascinating book i can't remember what best of list this book appeared on to get my attention and it's not my usual genre but however this book found its way to me i'm glad it did just when you think you've figured out how things are going to unfold there's yet another twist this book kept me engaged from start to finish and is extremely well written for a first book and not overwritten like many you'll find from those with creative writing masters degrees looking forward to more work from elizabeth silver with more work under her belt i can see her becoming as well known as gillian flynn and lisa scottoline","711":"i enjoyed this book because of the way the author presents a familiar story i was most intrigued by how she constructed the plot presenting the elements through shifts in time and characters awareness this surprised me as i usually like a faster pace","712":"ugh i couldn't bear to finish this neither the mother of the victim nor noa were people i could bring myself to care about bunch of pretentious nevermind","713":"i really liked 90% of this book wasn't a huge fan of the ending but overall a great weekend read read through most of it in a weekend","714":"i'm not a big fan of prison stories but this one was intriguing told in the alternating viewpoints of the convicted and the mother of the victim and the mystery behind the murder is a page turner","715":"an awesome read kept me turning the pages and i just loved the way the book was structured slowly revealing the circumstances behind the death of sarah dixon which is the crime that put the main character noa on death row i was definitely shocked by a certain twist toward the end and would completely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of mysteries and or crime dramas","716":"i really enjoyed this book and honestly what i think i enjoyed the most was how i didn't quite know how i felt at the end seeing the two perspectives and reading how everything unfolded made it difficult to figure out where my allegiances lie the structure of the book was well done and the characters particularly noa were robust definitely enjoyed","717":"this book is well written and has a solid story however there is something about it that left me feeling empty i didn't feel empathy for the main character until the end and that was fleeting i came away from it feeling let down and a little depressed there are some books i read again and again this won't be one of them","718":"cheesy like a lifetime movie had read good reviews but i was not impressed the big twists never happened","719":"i was pretty wrapped up in the story and was anxious to see how it turned out like another reviewer i found the ending incomplete and unsatisfying by the end i wasn't sure what to think of any of the characters","720":"i really enjoyed this book the characters were frustrating the story intriguing and i was not satisfied at the end in the best way","721":"this is a sad story that gives you a little bit of information at a time and in the end there is no stopping what happens","722":" this novel is astounding immediately i was drawn in and held within this story until long after finishing it elizabeth silver does a phenomenal job in her character development the ease of her writing and the emotional reserve of her characters quite readily lend itself to a cerebral audience the constancy of depth within each scene is beautifully placed behind witty candor and simplicity silver is able to effortlessly piece together humility with egoism and calloused indifference with astute bravery in an almost poetically existential manner silver manages to sidestep the more obvious characteristics that the reader may wish characters would have in place of authentic streams of raw actions and mannerisms that give light to the most intricate and naked versions of humanity itself this character driven narrative balances itself on moral scales in such a manner that the reader is left with understanding and compassion and an adapted version of their own belief systems this novel is an amazing representation of the human race at its polar extremes and the recognition of just how thin boundaries can be once we accept humanity's residency in the gray this is a must read","723":" wow this book certainly took me by surprise it's an incredibly impressive debut novel one that sucks you in from its very first pages the titular character noa is on death row in pennsylvania the book opens six months before her scheduled execution date when she receives a surprise visitor a new lawyer accompanied by the mother of the young woman whose death has placed noa in her current cell noa narrates her story with literary references high vocabulary and a sense of style seemingly at odds with her status as a college dropout noa's life story unfolds with each section ending with a letter to the deceased sarah dixon from her grieving mother and as more and more of the pieces of that fateful day fall together a very different and surprising story takes shape i imagine that this would make quite the provocative choice for book clubs and discussion groups so much so that i can't wait for one of my own friends to read this so that i can talk about it it is such an interesting fast paced read it is a surprisingly powerful novel and a gripping literary thriller i am already looking forward to seeing what this talented author will follow up this exciting debut novel with i hope the wait isn't too long","724":" if you want a satisfying inspirational moral filled conclusion don't read this book someday dysfunctional will include the title of this book in its definition noa p singleton sits on death row unsure when she will be executed but it will be within a few months from the time her victim's mother and a young idealistic lawyer visit her offering to arrange a clemency petition she really knows down deep that something is just not quite right as the story unfolds there are excruciating examples of bad decisions and denial i couldn't put it down and think it's a five star read","725":"i did really like this it wasnt as much of a page burner as i was hoping some parts were very slow and it made me think a lot","726":"noa is on death row for the murder of sarah dixon six months from noa's execution date she is visited by an attorney marlene dixon marlene is sarah's mother and she tells noa that she has recently come to the opinion that the death penalty is immoral and so she wants to file a clemency motion with the governor to have noa's sentence commuted from death to life in prison but marlene's motives are not completely pure she also wants to know why noa killed her daughter marlene has never been satisfied with the prosecution's theory of noa's motive and noa herself has not been forthcoming the execution of noa p singleton the actual cover reads the execution of noa p singleton a novel is an account of the six months leading up to noa's scheduled execution date the story is told through a first person memoir that noa is writing and through letters that marlene writes to her dead daughter neither noa nor marlene is really a likable character nor is sarah nor are noa's family members her mother her father and her brother the only really likable character in this novel is oliver ollie stansted marlene's young assistant who is helping her with marlene's clemency plea but likable characters are not necessary as the story itself drives the reader's interest i will say however that about the first third of the novel is a bit slow going but after the first 100 pages the novel really picks up the pace and the reader is presented with several crucial pieces of information view spoiler marlene's bribing noa to break up the relationship between caleb and sarah marlene's providing the abortion pill to caleb to give to sarah surreptitiously noa's revelation of her roll in the accidental death of her childhood friend persephone oliver's revelation that he had almost a decade earlier witnessed part of noa's trial noa's admission in the final pages that she intentionally murdered sarah because of the way sarah treated her and spoke to her when she went to sarah's apartment to try to help her hide spoiler that propel the narrative forward and keep the reader guessing as to what really happened with sarah's murder and what will happen with noa's ever approaching execution i love the playfulness of the title with the strike through on the cover explicitly stating that this is about the execution of a novel is it execution in the sense of something being carried out namely a novel being written or is it execution in the sense of the novel itself being executed or killed i think it is both first obviously a novel has been produced so our author has definitely accomplished that and so has in a way noa executed completed a novel with the writing of the novel of her life secondly view spoiler noa's memoir personal novel is executed when it is basically killed and buried by marlene marlene refuses to forward noa's memoir to oliver or even to read it herself so it's not much of a novel as no one other than the author noa has read it and then marlene buries the unread novel just like a dead body so in a way marlene kills executes noa's novel hide spoiler i enjoyed this novel especially the final two thirds and was delighted with the way it kept surprising me and i very much appreciated the author's boldness in the ending view spoiler despite the title it seems possible as we are reading that perhaps noa's life will be spared but the author doesn't flinch and pull out any last minute heroics to save noa's life and noa is executed more than that the execution is leaving aside questions of the morality of the death penalty just noa we finally find out despite many misgivings from earlier did murder sarah in cold blood yes sarah's murder would have been impossible without marlene but noa certainly knowingly and intentionally shot and killed sarah now marlene's controlling personality and her blackmailing noa's father caleb into slipping the abortion pill to sarah set in motion the events that inevitably led to sarah's murder had marlene never contacted noa sarah would never have been murdered and true to her characters the author ends the novel with marlene an arrogant and self righteous woman never really comprehending or owning up to just how complicit in her daughter's murder she herself was despite not pulling the trigger for her willingness to give us an unhappy ending i applaud the author hide spoiler","727":"well written definitely keeps you hanging really enjoyed trying to figure out what happened for a while i thought perhaps noa's father had killed sarah and that she was taking the rap for him which was confusing considering she barely knew him the plot twists kept me guessing","728":" i spend time on goodreads like other people spend time on facebook i have enjoyed reading the reviews of this book as much as i enjoyed the book i write my reviews only for my goodreads friends knowing no one else will likely ever see them as there are often hundreds or even thousands of reviews posted on a book before i get around to giving it a read that being said this book concerns me because it is a challenging feat to give it a rating and i don't want to lose my credibility i finished this book this morning but i'm still not sure how to rate it i thought this was going to be at least a 4 but no i liked the book but in the end i needed more the story unfolded in pieces and it was interesting albeit strange none of the characters were likeable and they all made bad sometimes downright crazy decisions but that went along with the story and was fine there have been complains about the writing which was wrought with metaphors some of which literally did not make sense but i bought into the idea that the narrator spoke that way there were even some twists or at least some things that occurred that were surprising in the end i was looking for the story to pull together more and for there to have been more clarity especially where marlene was concerned did she really believe her own bs maybe i glazed over and missed something really critical at the end of the book in a lot of ways this should be better than 3 stars but in the end","729":"excellent novel this was a true page turning i can not put it down and need to find out how it ends story line well written great characters not the least bit predictable","730":" we begin the novel almost at the end of the life of noa p singleton noa in six months will be executed for a murder she committed we find out that noa was found guilty ten years previously for the murder of a young woman noa is visited by an attorney oliver stansted who is working for marlene dixon the mother of the young woman noa murdered oliver's goal is to get noa a commuted sentence so that she will not be executed for the murder ultimately marlene's goal is to get noa to reveal what happened to lead to her daughter's death though noa is reluctant to revisit that with the attorney or marlene i ended up just rating this three stars because even though the storyline is an intriguing one i had a hard time finding anything commendable about the character of noa or marlene you quickly find out through noa's tale of her upbringing and what led her to murder another person that she is seriously not a sympathetic person at all there definitely seems at the end that the author wanted to show that noa wasn't all bad but i just didn't get there when we come upon the character of marlene and what actions she committed to lead to this tale you end up feeling appalled by her behavior as well i think it is very hard when an author writes a story told from the anti hero point of view you have to give the readers enough details to at least show them where the character is coming from so that the reader can at least root for that person or become invested in them in some way however in the end i definitely did not root for noa or excuse her for what she did finally i really couldn't understand marlene's thought process we find out that marlene at least guessed at what happened and why so why she needed noa to tell her story so to speak was just a framing device that i thought really didn't work in this story the way that it should have please note that i received this novel via the amazon vine program","731":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really wanted to like this book and it really wasn't my cup of tea the author has a lovely style of writing i'd like to check out her other works but her flowery style really didn't work for me with the type of story she was trying to tell it cropped up at the most inopportune times and at moments where simple language was begging to be used it's also not impossible to write a novel with unlikeable protagonists but it's difficult to do it well see gone girl there's a reason that go i really wanted to like this book and it really wasn't my cup of tea the author has a lovely style of writing i'd like to check out her other works but her flowery style really didn't work for me with the type of story she was trying to tell it cropped up at the most inopportune times and at moments where simple language was begging to be used it's also not impossible to write a novel with unlikeable protagonists but it's difficult to do it well see gone girl there's a reason that gone girl has received the acclaim that it has and it's because you have two protagonists that are awful people and yet you're still going to care and feel something for both of them with this novel everyone was just an awful person and i couldn't get attached to any of them it lacked the emotional connection for me that would pull me in and make me feel something anything also the realization that noa was really just a sociopath didn't work with the character i found her flat and affected instead of interesting more","732":"compelling unexpected good narrative not sure what i was expecting but it was decent","733":" the execution of noa p singleton is the brilliantly written debut novel by elizabeth l silver once i began this book i didn't close it until the last page the voice of noa narrates the story as she talks about her past and what led her to death row noa is at times not an enjoyable character for obvious reasons she killed someone much of the story readers are kept in the dark about what really transpired the night 10 years prior to her conviction the novel begins with a welsh lawyer named oliver stansted letting noa know that the victim's mother is no longer wanting her to be executed so she's going to try all that she can to grant her clemency or a new trial this surprises noa because she can still vividly remember the words that the death penalty is the single most profound punishment to grace the judicial system among other choice words ultimately noa is dictating her life to oliver and keeping her secrets in the process initially noa seems cold abrasive and unnecessarily sarcastic but as the book goes on i appreciated her intelligence humor and acceptance this novel is full of characters that readers will either love or hate i'm not sure if i liked any of them but i still cared enough about noa and marlene the victim's mother to hope they came to some sort of resolution themes such as resolution innocence guilt and truth reign supreme in this novel i really appreciated elizabeth l silver providing readers with a complex novel that didn't go one way or another on the side of executions and wether it's right or wrong there are facts stated but nothing in your face about opposing the death penalty or not it's a hot topic that will forever be debated until forever thankfully we don't have to have that argument here and in it's place is actually a really great novel in conclusion i highly recommend the execution of noa p singleton to everyone it's a fast read that's immediately engrossing with very rich characters the mystery will keep readers guessing until the end silver has made a fan out of me","734":"very interesting story and kept me reading late into the night hints about noa's background and the full story are slyly revealed as the book progresses and the last third of the book is especially compelling","735":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here probably more like a 3 5 stars i found myself enjoying the book at times but it is one of those books that in the end you almost feel like it was all for nothing it just went on too long it was an interesting character study to see how things unfolded but then there was really nothing no resolution no justice in my opinion it was one of those books where practically everyone is unlikeable and then you find out why and ta da the end","736":"this book was boring p i dnf @pg 100 and i've been reading this book for 2 weeks p oh we'll better luck next time","737":"don't read this the plot twist isn't worth it i will personally explain it to you if you're dying to know and then you will say and and i'll say that's it and you'll say oh um k and that will be that","738":"entertainment weekly gave this book an a minus i usually agree with their recommendations not this time","739":" i did like this book i recently started getting the sunday nyt book section from my friend chris i guess i thought of it as the holy grail of book reviews and have been avidly putting myself down on the online lists for my library this is the third one i've read that was recommended by the new york times one i didn't read beyond the first 20 pages i never do that what to think i don't know the second one was good this one was good however i've read better books that haven't made it to the hallowed pages of the nyt that's all i have to say about it well almost this is a good book i wonder if i would have liked it better if i hadn't gone in with exceptionally high expectations don't let this review stop you from reading it if you've heard good things","740":"my wife always says i love boring books boring books are books where nothing happens but the author spends a lot of time and effort in the craft of making nothing happen or they can be called works of literary fiction i always make fun of my wife for reading terrible books terrible books are books where everything gets tied together in the end but the author spends very little time and effort in the craft of creating beautiful sentences or they can be called works of mystery and or thrillers this book is both boring and terrible it gets two stars for being slightly boring and only partially terrible the total cheat of having two first person narrators first of all the letters from the mother of the victim to her daughter the victim duh coupled with the omniscient ugh and unreliable first person narrative makes for a narrative where the reader is given everything he or she needs and don't get me started on the twist in the plot i did not see that coming yeah well that's because it's just ridiculously stitched into the fabric of the narratives veiled references to such a traumatic event in a first person narration sheesh i respect the hell out of the authors blurbing this book i have to wonder how they saw what they say they saw","741":" every book has a potential to be a great read this book barely took off before it crashed and burned this author was so busy trying to give her words colorful turns that some sentences made no sense it brought to mind the book entitled me talk pretty one day referring to title only in this case the author should have renamed her book me write fancy one day finally i admit that i stuck to the end there had to be some redemption to this book but alas none came sorry i wasted my time on this","742":"i can't say that i enjoyed this book it was a bit too arms length for me to feel really invested in either the novel or characters but the novel was really well written and amazingly powerful the last couple of pages were surprising and searing","743":"\"it's a funny phenomenon you can never visit your own funeral but if you want to see how people feel about you commit a crime \"","744":"i'm frankly shocked that people liked this book so much i was excited to start because the whole premise seemed to be so interesting but what silver did was take a good idea and fill a book with bad writing and one dimensional characters who i cared nothing about i made myself keep reading because of the great twist at the end which is my weakness pffft don't bother so many really good books out there this is not one of them","745":"wow what a book","746":"2016 vreading challenge a book whose cover is your favorite color the cover was purple so i grabbed it and started in with no further vetting let's not get into arguments over whether the cover is really purple or really blue - my mom and i had that same ongoing argument over a particular sweater i owned for literally decades at any rate i like that color that hovers somewhere between deep purple and deep blue diagnosis too ambitious for a first novel but enough interest and promise that i look forward to silver's next outing from the beginning i wanted this book to be more than it was and in retrospect i think the author did too it's clear to me that silver tried her best to make it into more but bit off a bit more than she could chew in terms of literary goals it could have been a tense psychological exploration of the mind of a murderer or a searing indictment of the american justice system or a legal procedural that focuses on the post conviction criminal appeal process or a portrait of american class warfare it didn't quite succeed at any of those things but it came close enough on all counts that it broke my heart to see it fall short in the opening scene we meet our cynical world weary anti heroine noa p singleton who is on death row for a murder she has never denied committing and oliver stansted the fresh faced earnest young lawyer who wants to take an in depth interview to build a last ditch petition for clemency based on a plea of compassion for noa as a person for this he needs to get the unwilling uninterested and uncooperative noa to spill her life story and to really let him get a glimpse of what makes her tick so he can convince the state of pennsylvania she's worth keeping around we also have ollie's boss marlene dixon who is not only one of the more well connected and influential criminal lawyers in philadephia but just happens to be the bereaved mother of noa's victim sarah dixon allegedly she's had a change of heart about the death penalty and has put her young associate ollie on this assignment to save her daughter's murderer from execution it's fairly clear her more likely motivation is to simply extract a genuine confession and explanation of her daughter's death from noa in light of noa's ten years of stubborn silence on the issue of what happened that day from that promising beginning i immediately got a vision of this story as a great dramatic interview movie in the style of doubt or frost nixon the concept is sort of a mash up of a chorus line and that classic interview between hannibal lechter and clarice starling only done from the point of view of the one inside the cell it could have been one of those movies that pits two great dramatic leads opposite each other for two hours in a prison interview booth with almost nothing else happening and wins oscars and golden globes there could have been a climax where earnest young lawyer loses a searing contest of wills with cynical death row inmate and gives up a personal confession of his own fundamentally changing the tenor and direction of the entire story there was in fact such a confession but it was a big nothing in terms of this dynamic and the structure of the story so much more could have been done with that i couldn't help picturing who might play the major characters on the screen christine baranski as marlene dixon wearing a perfect suit and an air of icy competence that masks something brittle something screaming inside at her inexplicable inability to save her wayward daughter goldie hawn maybe as noa's flaky fuck up of a mother a pathetic woman who made noa everything that she is and isn't a wanna be actress whose career takes her from failed audition to failed audition and whose biggest moment was a cat food commercial but who still thinks her big break is ahead of her mickey rourke as noa's absentee dad caleb an ex con who's trying to live a low key life a small time tough who's good with his fists but a total wuss at handling anything more complicated than a bar fight and whose mo is to run away just like he did from noa's mom someone vanilla and pretty as sarah dixon who was being groomed for a perfect life of upper class privilege and was indulging in predictable fits of rebellion by slumming with caleb and has convinced herself she's genuinely in love with him instead of just mad at mom someone equally vanilla and pretty to play oliver stansted the idealistic young law student who fell in love with the american legal system while visiting and came across the pond from london to fight the good fight on behalf of america's imprisoned underdogs his sole job is to get noa talking but i couldn't figure out who would play noa herself even after finishing the book i don't feel like i have a clear enough picture of her to cast her clearly smart a fuck up from the start wasted potential a victim of a flawed system a victim of bad parenting she's not particularly likeable but nor does she come across as all that loathsome in so many ways she's a metaphor for the book itself a promising project that came to a bad end none of them are particularly likeable but they're all at least moderately interesting and when you put them together we have the makings of something that could be really really good but no from those early airy hopes the literary souffle quickly falls flat the moment silver used the phrase \"delectably irresistible \" quite early on i groaned and gave up on this being a great piece of dramatic writing or anything that could possibly be the basis of that great dramatic movie i was hoping for it's clear that silver wants it to be that serious sort of literary book and it seems to try to be a number of different things at different points but it doesn't quite succeed at any of them silver's trying to make noa into a devilishly clever willful manipulative yet somehow still sympathetic adversary somewhere midway between a rebellious punk kid and a less terrifying more human hannibal lechter but she's just not up to the task and the narrative sinks into white banality while noa remains muddled and unconvincing as either a fascinating villain an understandably bitter victim of the system or an admirable martyr she comes off as more bratty and sulky than anything else and i'm not sure it's entirely due to lack of craft on silver's part i really wonder if you can write that kind of tense gritty psychological struggle between interviewer and prisoner from the prisoner's own first person pov where there is no mystery preserved about the killer's own thoughts attitudes and motivations in terms of structure the story quickly gives up all pretense of lawyer interviewing prisoner at all and just becomes noa telling from her own point of view both her life and the story of what happened and what went wrong it left me wondering why silver ever bothered introducing the milquetoast character of oliver stansted at all with oliver so ineffectual as a character the narrative and the dramatic struggle between the characters would have been tighter and cleaner if it had just been noa versus marlene from the beginning i mentioned white banality and yes noa is white and the entire narrative is as white as white bread - never mind that the actual demographics of women on death row are decidedly non white it took me a while to actively figure out noa's race and my first clue was the complete absence of race in the narrative until we finally get a couple of clues that her mother has auburn hair and her father is the \"only white guy in the bar \" i think only a white narrative could be so obliviously color blind the reviews are all over the place as to whether the writing is wonderful or horrible and here's the thing silver isn't a bad writer she could be really good she clearly likes wordsmithing maybe a little too much but i get that because i like it too the problem is she's caught up in the fun of writing nifty metaphors that she thinks will impress people but they too often just come off wacky and distracting instead probably all the text really needed was a much firmer editor's hand to tone down all the unwarranted flights of fancy there is a beauty in solidly crafted workmanlike writing that just gets out of the way and tells the story but silver hasn't mastered it and her editor clearly doesn't appreciate it either if a book were a building i'd tell silver to work on just crafting a solid brick house first and make sure you can build one that stands up and keep out the weather before you try your hand at fairy castles but don't give up on the craft entirely because you might have some real talent in there on further thought i wonder if we all ought to give silver a little more credit with regard to her wacky metaphors because the entire narrative is in noa's first person perspective could it be that she's intentionally writing clunky prose to channel the voice of gifted but wasted noa who has nothing but time on her hands to stare at her cell bars and come up with silly ways to describe them and her life on the plus side it passes the bechdel test in spades all the most important characters are women and their favorite topic of conversation is the dead one sarah","747":" as they say in popular culture \"i can't even \" giving \"the execution of noa p singleton\" one star makes me want to revisit my other one star ratings and score them higher it was bad i feel that reading to the end reflects badly on me like why didn't i give up where should i begin i started taking note of the examples of the truly awful writing but quickly gave up i'm relieved that many other goodreads reviewers also quote some examples there are many to choose from but two that actually made me stop reading to just appreciate the awfulness were \"a sooty drop of vanilla fell to his chin and he removed it with his tongue long and lean as an amusement park slide cleaning off the frozen remains \"how can vanilla ice cream be sooty soot is defined as \"a deep black powdery or flaky substance consisting largely of amorphous carbon produced by the incomplete burning of organic matter \" i guess it could be flaky but sooty as an adjective is generally used in reference to its color and why does the narrator need to reminisce about her father's tongue being long and lean why is this simile necessary what does it add i know it seems like i'm being too harsh on one isolated sentence but the whole book is written in this way one needs to plod through one unnecessary affected flourish after another and it detracts from the story here's another line that bothered me \"the quest toward a windmill is more fulfilling than an empty stroll sometimes even if the windmill isn't real \" i feel like the author once heard something about don quixote and quests and windmills and just tried to make this literary reference but just... no the writing is so needlessly opaque that it's hard to keep up with what plot there is and you know what i think i should just wrap this up very quickly the relationship between all characters are ridiculous and unreal noa oliver noa her father noa marlene and characters are unlikeable unidentifiable and unbelievable in a bad way like joffrey baratheon is unlikeable in a good way one enjoys hating him eva from \"we need to talk about kevin\" is not someone every reader will identify with yet you get where she's coming from and amy dunne certainly ends up being almost too much unbelievable yet the author has done such a good job you better believe in amy but here the characters didn't make any sense why would he do that why would she say that etc series like \"rectify\" have beautifully portrayed complex characters in death row even orange is the new black does a better job explaining the different choices that women take that lead them to prison here adult noa behaves like a sullen smirking teenager with her arms crossed and tongue constantly stuck out whether her tongue is long and lean or short or stubby or just regular sized the author didn't specify don't read this book not even if you're in vacation with nothing else to do and are waiting for the books you ordered online to arrive not even if this was on sale","748":"i loved the authors writing style and use of language and character development a she successfully uses morality and guilt to paint the grey area that causes an emotional response in the reader the problem is i have to give her an f for the plot devices she uses to bring about the situations of conflict that make the book otherwise impactful i just couldn't swallow most of the twists and turns a five star story teller with a 2 star story i still enjoyed it and think it is worth reading","749":"wonderfully written and a compelling read narrated by a woman on death row for murder interspersed with letters written to the victim by her mother highly recommend","750":" i am torn as to how to rate this book the story dragged at first was difficult to get into and yet once i got into it i was unable to put it down finished it in one session i didn't like the main character and yet i sense that was exactly what the author was going for how easy is it to like someone on death row facing execution essentially unlikable in society and yet i think i liked noa as frustrating as she might have been the story had some nice twists and turns and definitely kept my attention i would recommend it and will look forward to further releases from this author","751":"this was a great debut novel it was suspenseful with great character development of noa and marlene","752":"this was just okay","753":" in this novel death row prisoner noa p singleton narrates the story of her life how she ended up on death row and how mysteriously the high powered lawyer mother of the woman she killed is trying to work to get her sentence forgiven i am pleased to say that this is a murder mystery not of the who but of the why in which i was not able to guess the why although i was convinced my svu watching skills were going to pay off yet again i was actually pleasantly surprised by the ending i think what really elevated this novel above being a simple boilerplate mystery was its driving theme that so often we decide the truth about someone and then work at it so it becomes the truth this is presented clearly throughout nora's trial and especially so through the ending which i won't spoil this idea presented by an author who is also a lawyer is a powerful one and one that should be on the minds of everyone who sits on a jury","754":" definitely a thought provoking read do not continue reading this review if you haven't finished the book yet i'm left fascinated by marlene's character she seems like a sociopath with the misfortune of having an involuntary maternal instinct there weren't really any likeable characters though noa is a depressed girl who doesn't react well to her life circumstances she basically goes along with the guilty charge and death penalty because she doesn't actually want to live marlene is a conscienceless tyrant whose main talent is threatening blackmailing people into submission caleb is a spineless drunk noa's mother is a selfish whore who doesn't like being a mother unless it garners her attention and from what we saw if sarah in the final pages she is as violently unlikeable as her mother a very dramatic drama if it weren't such a fast read i would not have made it to the end","755":" eh this book was just ok the story was pretty good but i just couldn't find anything there to feel anything about i think i was supposed to feel something for the narrator the eponymous noa p singleton but i really didn't the book is told in first person from two different perspectives neither of these characters made me feel anything for them and neither of them did i find to be trustworthy narrators the twist toward the end if you could call it that was not shocking i didn't see it coming but it also didn't really make me feel anything all in all i found it to be pretty shallow reading","756":"interesting twists and character relationships","757":"noa's story the tale of her life and the months leading to her execution is not something i normally would pick up after hearing a great deal of buzz about it i dove in and soon got lost in the intricacies of her story it left me unsettled but in a good way this is one of the few books in which i held off on the temptation to turn to the back read the ending and then go back to the story at least until 3 4 of the way through the book","758":"different could have been great","759":"i was deeply disappointed with the ending even as i knew both narrators were unreliable i expected some kind of resolution which did not come","760":"thought provoking love the way the story slowly unfolds","761":"if you are looking for a page turner that you won't be able to stop reading this is for you did noa commit the heinous crime of which she has been convicted is the victim's mother really going to plea for clemency for her while she sits on death row this book is full of twists and surprises and it will leave you guessing until the last chapter it will make you think about the death penalty and the complicated relationships of family this will be a great choice for book clubs","762":"page turner withnsome surprises but no redeeming characters i felt for her and disliked the mom and no one won so i felt empty at the end","763":" beautifully written dark tale of an inmate on death row u0026amp the motley crew of characters that make up her life that is all yes it has dark tones to it but there was nothing really twisted none of that law u0026amp order svu fancy last minute triple double throw you through a loop kind of twist when the big reveal arrives you kinda feel like ok now we are getting somewhere only to discover that you've already arrived that's all you are going to get once that moment passes the book continues on to its predictable ending that is suppose to be sad but kinda misses the mark it's a tale of accountability fini","764":"a good story with many twists and turns and that ending","765":"nicely written novel that i would definitely recommend while i had a good idea on where it was ultimately leading i sort of hoped xxxx would have better acknowledged her involvement in sarah's death and would have suffered more emotionally because of it used xxxx to prevent spoilers obviously this little issue does not take away from the story at all but as a fan of the more vengeful incarceration novels such as count of monte cristo i really wanted revenge in some way","766":"audiobooki can't say much without giving away the entire book but this one was quite enjoyable","767":"an extraordinary story about two murders one girl whose parents should have been banned from parenting and all the events that lead noa to the end of her story i thought it was well written not only for the story line but the author's use of language i loved the ending and would enjoy discussing it with others who have read this novel","768":"i can't figure out how to do half stars i's give this 3 1 2 stars it's a good read but as usual i scimmed the last 10 pages i'd had enough","769":"this book was a good read all based on the ending unfortunately the ending was so horrible and it made the book fall so flat at the end that 2 stars is a gift","770":"i guess i'd say the plot may have been strange and the writing may have not been perfect but it was easy to become absorbed in what was happening that's all i really want from books i want the pages to keep turning as fast as i can skim the words almost forgetting there's words at all as i watch it play out","771":"no laughs here this is a serious thought provoking book that kept me engaged i'm still wondering about things","772":"i agree with the metaphor review and am not quite sure i read the entire book because my mp3 player skipped or something anyway no surprises and i don't think i missed anything","773":"i really liked this book very interesting plot development","774":"didn't like the book ending was not satisfying or plausible wouldn't recommend it","775":" this was an excellent book i couldn't wait to get back to reading it each day noa is a complicated character one who is difficult to like but also one you empathize with at the same time i found myself wondering throughout if noa was innocent or not the actual crime is not described until near the end and when i finally found out what happened i found i still had mixed feelings about it all this is a story that really opens your eyes to how easily people can fall astray a great first novel for elizabeth silver","776":" i searched for this book and read it based on a review in a magazine all the time i was reading it i was perplexed as to why anyone would think it was special but as i devoured the final few chapters i was left mulling over the underlying mysteries that were never quite wrapped up as neatly as we've come to expect that wondering is what makes me hate the book and love it at the same time i might think about this one for a while noa is on death row for capital murder the victim is her father's pregnant girlfriend the entire book seems to be a convoluted memory trail that leads us to wonder about who should really be termed the victim in this story","777":"definitely a page turner but an unsatisfying ending i'm from philadelphia where the book takes place so i could picture everything as it was happening","778":"really well written with interesting characters","779":"i got all the way to page 9 and thought yuck what a waste of words and paper the author seems to want to be clever and it only turns out to be stupid here's an example from the first paragraph in this world you are either good or evil the gray middle ground that mucous thin terrain where most of life resides is really only a temporary annex like gestation or purgatory it shadows over everyone in its vacuous and insipid cape flying across the sky making smoke letters out of your fears mucous thin what then the middle ground shadows wears a cape and flies across the sky making smoke letters out of your fears what in the world does that mean and the paragraph continues on in the same vein i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed so i reread that paragraph many times to see if i was just missing the metaphors and similes nope i don't think so it's just awful writing by page 9 i shut the book and will return it to the library when it stops snowing","780":"this book was lent to me by a friend not my usual cup of tea really there were no surprises yes she was guilty not of one but two murders did the victim's mother really have a change of heart no she was still bitter and mean and just wanted to watch noa twist in the wind i like my thrillers to have a more clearly defined path rather than all the touchy feely stuff a bit of a disappointing read","781":"a bit slow to get into at first but then i couldn't put it down i also was kicking myself at the end for not making some connections sooner","782":"this is for sure a book that you want to talk about with someone when you finish reading it it was a page turner that i couldn't put down however at the end i was left with questions so i really would like to be able to give the book a 3 1 2 but don't have that option","783":" i can tell this one was written by a lawyer jesus this person likes to hear themselves write talk whatever with the exception of oliver there were no likeable characters in this story this was chosen for book group and i can't wait to tear it apart it was horrible i was never entertained intrigued connected enthralled nothing if there would have been some more solid emotions behind the characters' and their motives at least something anything give me just a modicum of anything real i think this would have been a whole hell of a lot better noa deserved to go to prison caleb was a sniffling cowardice of a man marlene was just cold and none of her letters were felt with any sympathy or concern sarah was just like her mother all of them were just wretched and for the record 1 simile is quite sufficient maybe 2 at the most i don't need 4 i don't need to read a paragraph full of what something smelled like or how the person walked or every little effin detail get to the story get to the guts of the matter get to the point i'm out","784":"i stuck with it but i did not enjoy the book","785":"to long to wordy not at all satisfying","786":"i wavered about rating this book a 4 but didn't for a few reasons while the last 1 3 of the book definitely sucked me in as the author dropped bombshell upon bombshell it took a long time to get there i also struggle whenever i read a book where every single character is unlikable and this was one of them i wanted to feel sympathetic for the main character or at least have some feeling of understanding her but despite the very well written story i never really got her","787":"i have mixed feelings on this novel overall the plot was good and had some twists that i was not expecting but the characters were all either unlikeable or empty i could not empathize with any of them by the end it did not matter to me whether noa died","788":"regardless of which side you're on concerning the issue of the death penalty elizabeth l silver's the execution of noa p singleton is a thought provoking debut six months before her execution noa p singleton receives an unexpected visit the mother of her victim marlene dixon informs her she's had a change of heart and doesn't believe in capital punishment working with her associate oliver stansted she creates an organization mad mothers against death but noa doesn't want anything to do with marlene or her organization oliver works tirelessly on noa's behalf but noa doesn't talk as the countdown begins to her execution we're left with questions regarding noa's version of events will noa be granted clemency or will she be tied to her fate narrative is first person and at times it makes it difficult for the reader to trust noa silver does a good job slowly detailing noa's past since this is noa's story and we're on a journey to find out exactly why she's on death row it makes sense that it's in first person we do get marlene's point of view via letters to her daughter and some readers call them melodramatic and i agree but again marlene has made a career as a lawyer and she knows how to give a presentation the only complaint i have is regarding oliver he was fresh out of law school and in many ways naive but i would have loved his thoughts on both marlene and noa we're introduced to another secondary character and i won't go into detail as to who they are specifically and i'll leave that up to you to find out but i was upset on behalf of noa the heart of the novel really is noa and her past as she slowly begins to open up you can't help but feel sorry for her here was this woman who did what she did because that's all she knew i'm not revealing a spoiler as to whether or not she's guilty i'll leave that up to you to find out at the same time we have a grieving mother who is linked to noa in ways the reader can't imagine i was shocked and the twist silver gives us i wasn't expecting it there are a few unanswered questions but i'll let them be because in real life those don't get addressed it's true what silver writes regarding a crime or a murder and that everyone wants to know why as secrets are revealed i couldn't help but think i didn't want to know about sarah our victim it's terrible to even think about it but by the time we're introduced to her we've spent so much time with noa that you can't help but be on her team and cheering for her silver makes it difficult for us to feel any empathy towards sarah i debated with the rating heavily shortly after reading it i gave it a five but in hindsight it's a four i really liked it but the writing is a bit too descriptive in some areas and it makes it difficult for the reader to decipher what silver is trying to convey silver doesn't take a side with regards to the death penalty nor does she explore the topic in depth the execution of noa p singleton makes us think about noa's history and how this fictional character on death row becomes a little more alive with each page it won't make you change your stance but it will leave you thinking about the injustice of the system and if your friends read it you'll have a great discussion about the book and the sentencing of death row inmates my favorite quote \"it's a funny phenomenon you can never visit your own funeral but if you want to see how people feel about you commit a crime \"if you're looking for a thought provoking novel add elizabeth l silver's the execution of noa p singleton to your reading list this review posted at literary etc","789":"wow just wow it's going to take a few days to process this one loved silver's sharp writing and the intensity she created from page one so dark and twisty","790":"a generally an alright read however death row prisoner stories even fiction aren't my first choice in reading materal this book is from one of my book clubs there was an interesting development that improved my overall opinion but would not probably recommend this one","791":"really liked it good plot twist","792":" i may have been influenced by the other reviews on here of this book but even if i was the reviews are accurate the book is only ok as many of the review have said the books has an interesting idea but it takes it nowhere there is no character development no advancement of the plot the story is told from a few different views noa who is in prison for killing a young woman and the victim's mother i had hoped for other perspectives or even some change in the mothers or noa's perspective but there is none i'm not going to say much about the plot and maybe that's because my expectations are shaped by movies that the viewer reader needs to be left feeling good about what has just been seen or read that does not happen here as with most of life the book just ends but i can't help but feel disappointed that there wasn't some sort of justice done unfortunately that happens all too often in life too","793":"i listened to this book and it was okay i liked the premise but was left waiting for twist that never came","794":"i think that this could've been 4 5 stars but life just kept getting in the way of my reading i would pick up the book read 2 pages then get interrupted if i hadn't read it in such small dribs and drabs i would've been completely engrossed in the narrator's voice this is an expertly crafted novel with expertly crafted sentences paragraphs chapters etc highly recommended","795":"wow great book and excellent writing a woman sits on death row her memories of her crime and punishment dysfunctional families great read kept me guessing","796":"i'm surprised people are not talking about this book i thought it was similar to gone girl by gillian flynn but even better","797":"actually 3 5 a good idea and certainly different but it took more effort than it should have to get to the end while i loved the characters and much of the plotline i found the writing did not remain interesting for long stretches which made it a little stodgy overall","798":" the execution of noa p singleton grips you from page one it tells the tale of noa p singleton a woman on death row for murder noa has never spoken a word about what happened on the night of the murder - not even at her trial noa meets a new lawyer oliver stansted who convinces her he might have the key to commute her death sentence to life but if only she opens up about what really happened on the night of the killing enter marlene dixon high powered attorney and the evil pompous and manipulative mother of noa's victim and oliver stansted boss noa was a surprisingly likable character even though she is not all together trustful or truthful the casts of main characters are complicated self serving and dishonest everyone has ulterior motives i highly recommend this book this book has it all secrets betrayal deception and lies","799":"great read could not put it down","800":"read my review here http utahmomslife blogspot com 2013","801":" i kept thinking this is surely going to become a david fincher movie then i look up david fincher on imdb com and see that he's directing the movie adaptation of gone girl ahhh interesting i admit to having picked up noa p because random house has been touting it as a if you liked gone girl which has to be the book marketing catchphrase of 2013 but noa p doesn't leave the reader hanging at the end of each chapter like gillian flynn's bestseller i wanted silver to stop using fancy words and fancy metaphors and get on with telling the story no one talks like that no one thinks like that ex use of the words wont and fortnight i frequently had to consult with my husband who has a jd on some of the legal terminology and he wasn't even sure on a couple things coincidentally i've been watching orange is the new black via netflix streaming the last couple days like noa piper is a thirty something incarcerated educated white female while piper's waspy ways make her an outsider you never get the feeling that she thinks she above everyone i speculate this is why orange is taking off noa's snobbery is insufferable at times i thought perhaps the execution of noa p singleton would rattle my position on the death penalty instead it unintentionally makes a case for gun control if anything i predict a drastically different looking paperback cover and maybe a film by fox searchlight","802":" i don't know what to think i am left depressed after finishing the novel sad as if i lost someone instead of just having finished a novel i wasn't even sure how to rate it because it was well written and captivating but left me lost and bereft as odd as that may seem all i can say for certain is that i need to read something else as a palate cleanser before i go to sleep update several months after reading it this is not a book for those wanting a happy escape this book will stay with you and can be depressing to think upon even months after you finish it don't get me wrong it is a great book but be forewarned that it is a heavy book 10 star rating 8","803":"http maryward booktrib com reviews","804":" this book had a good flow that made it quite easy to quickly read and had some good characters in it that made the reading of the book enjoyable almost as if reading a biography of a killer on death row but it wasn't a biography and that is what makes me give this book a 3 5 as there was no intrigue no suspense and the characters made it seem even less interesting as they were very apathetic towards every thing in the book i felt that the writing was good and maybe even above average but the story lacked intrigue and instead of using the characters to make it more intriguing the author choose to use them to push the story in the other direction and make you the reader feel as if the whole thing is pointless i can only recommend it for the writing at this point and if you enjoy court law then maybe you may enjoy this as well","805":"this seemed to take me forever to read which already says something i liked how the murder was revealed but by bit but i just didn't have any desire to turn the pages characters weren't that interesting plot was too long","806":" i finished it even though i didn't really like it because i was expecting some great payoff that would make it all worth it but it didn't happen it was written well enough except the author really overdid it with the similes and metaphors to the point that it got on my nerves i felt like she could've saved some time and pages if her descriptions weren't so cheesy and over the top also none of the characters was appealing or sympathetic seriously none of them i didn't hope noa would be released i just wanted to know if she really did it the mother of the murdered girl was a manipulative nasty a hole the deadbeat dad was a boring pathetic loser and the murdered girl wasn't developed much but the brief time we got to know her she seemed like a nasty jerk too so anyhoo it was long winded with some cheesy over the top writing all of the characters were unlikable jerks and there was no payoff at the end so none of it was worth it you can thank me for saving you from reading it","807":"a disturbing book interesting discussions on death penalty but characters that are very flawed and hard to love our systems seem stymied by subjective bad behavior retribution guilt and vengeance makes a fair trial impossible and while well written with a forceful plot energy making me read forward i ended with a queasy feeling","808":"interesting character development with twists and turns along the story leaves you wanting more","809":"noa singleton is on trial for murder and about to be die power attorney marlene dixon wants to commute her sentence to life marlene has her own agenda and the showdown between these two is entertaining plus a hitchcockian twist at the end","810":"i hate typing on an ipad so this will be a choppy review this is about a woman on death row who is approached by the mother of the victim and tells noa that she will do her best to get her off death row then story goes thru flashbacks and scenes from the past until we get to present day this was quite a page turner and i finished this in about 3 hours it's a bit reminiscent of gone girl i really liked the writer's style and the overall premise of the story but the ending was a bit meh","811":"avery depressing story about a woman who couldn't seem to take charge of her own life yes she had a crummy mother and her father ran off but there was still opportunity for her to make something of herself but she seemed to refuse and then tried to cover up her evil acts too much of a downer for me","812":"gave up on it out of boredom around 60 pages in","813":"this is not an easy read noa singleton is on death row for murder when the thoroughly unpleasant and manipulative mother marlene of the woman she killed shows up 6 months prior to the execution date offering noa the possibility of a reprieve what follows is the flashback story of noa her childhood with a narcissistic single mother meeting her absentee alcoholic father and how she commits the act for which she is condemned her story is rough and heart breaking yet noa is never self pitying in fact she's fairly unlikeable but somehow draws the reader in interspersed with noa's story are the visits with her new attorney oliver who seems too naive to be working a death sentence case and the self serving letters that marlene writes to her long dead daughter the ending is shocking yet somehow inevitable","814":" i finished this but barely it was touch and go and if the book had been much longer i wouldn't have made it the author's writing just doesn't appeal to me the metaphors are too thick the literary phrasings too forced the moral or point of the book not effective i think the author intended this to be a book that forced the reader to ponder the value of the death penalty and the workings of the us judicial system but i never got beyond a passing curiosity and overall boredom with the characters and their stories was this supposed to be suspenseful was i supposed to be asking myself whether noa did the crime and if so why should i have been focused on marlene's obsession what happened well i wasn't mild curiosity was all i could muster not recommended","815":" elizabeth silver's debut novel opens with the introduction of noa p singleton waiting on death row in a pennsylvania prison six months prior to her scheduled execution ten years after her original trial and with little hope of an appeal noa has accepted her fate when she is unexpectedly visited by powerful lawyer marlene dixon with a sudden change of heart marlene the mother of noa's victim has decided to work toward a clemency petition as noa's execution date nears she attempts to piece together her past to figure out who her changing circumstances will benefit and if she truly deserves forgiveness as i started reading the execution of noa p singleton i was quickly distracted by the flowery style of silver's writing with strings of mismatched words often interrupted by afterthoughts in parentheses i felt more like noa was writing a college admissions letter than introducing readers to her story however as noa begins to detail her past she takes on a lighter more narrative tone that is easier to digest silver is quite adept at leading readers down unexpected paths and into unforeseen moral dilemmas what i thought might be a simple examination of the american criminal justice system was actually a novel that kept me guessing to the very end the execution of noa p singleton is a well researched smart look at the perils of capital punishment with just enough suspense to keep readers on edge","816":"i enjoyed this more than i thought i would makes you question the true meaning of innocent and guilty and it changes throughout the story","817":"an involving story about a woman on death row and the mother of the victim","818":" a study of a convicted murderer on death row as her life is recounted in the final months awaiting her execution is the subject of this first novel by an author with three college degrees including one in law at the same time it delves into her relationship with her mother her father and others who have interacted with her especially marlene the mother of the victim who is not a particularly sympathetic character there is no suspense with regard to the ultimate execution of noa p singleton this fact is included in the title whatever suspense exists derives from the introduction of a possible clemency petition by the mother of the murder victim a well known philadelphia attorney who by the way initially demanded the death penalty and then supposedly years later approached noa on behalf of an organization she founded mothers against death claiming a change of heart apparently a major point of the novel is the juxtaposition of noa and marlene and their motivations about the only truly insightful looks into marlene are in the form of letters to her daughter following her death and these are really superficial and lack sufficient depth to create either sympathy for the mother or deeper knowledge as to why she has acted as she did to tell the truth for this reader the writing was too wordy and the novel's construction somewhat artificial","819":"the book was unconvincing the writing oscillated from elaborate and forced to simple the author seemed to write the dialogue she imagined in her head without considering how characters might really talk finally i found the story especially the trial naggingly unrealistic such a trial does not seem plausible to me at all bypass this one if you see it on the shelf","820":"omg this one hit me hard right in the solar plexus and the heart it's been a long time since a book made me cry especially one without cute animals in it but this one had me hiccuping on the drive home from work silver had written a masterpiece that will stay with me for a long time the character of noa speaks to me the unreliable narrator with the smartass cocky exterior protecting something a bit softer inside you might not like her but you can feel for her and her train wreck of a life i had very little sympathy for marlene and i'm not sure that the reader should as for noa's father you end up wishing she never knew who he was highly recommend for the plot and compelling characters","821":" i loved noa's voice and the way that all of the minor details from her seemingly unrelated story turned up again in a different light at one point she makes a reference to kevin spacey's monologue in the usual suspects that's a great nod to the reader that she knows exactly what she's doing unfortunately none of the other characters seemed even a fraction as nuanced as noa the plot machinery required to pull of the ending requires a few twists that felt like they undermined a lot of the thoughtful character development i will definitely keep an eye on what silver does next","822":"some interesting parts about capital punishment and prison system a page turner but for me the characters were so flat and i didn't care about any of them","823":"i really enjoyed this book a lot of unexpected happenings it's a goodread","824":" the execution of noah p singletonbyelizabeth l silvermy in a nutshell summary noah is about to be executed this book is about her life the life that led up to her impending death my thoughts after reading this book this is such an unusual book for me to choose to read noa doesn't seem to care much about the fact that she has been on death row for years and then just months before her execution marlene the mother of the woman she was convicted of murdering approaches her with a plan to save her from being executed so she ends up with this bitter woman and a british attorney who seem to be trying to save her life most of the book is about noa's life her mother her absent father her friends her life it's sad it's bizarre it's enlightening what i loved about this book this was such a sad book i read and respected its sadness noa had a sad strange life and at times she seemed to be emotionless i was surprised by an event in her childhood i think you will be too she seemed mostly alone in this world sort of stiff and cold and alone what i did not love it's incredibly easy to strongly dislike noa it was also incredibly easy to strongly dislike marlene noa seemed off she seemed to lack some basic human values and she seemed incredibly harsh and cold final thoughts this was an interesting book to read it was different but it absolutely captured and kept my attention","825":"i was really unimpressed with this book it wasn't terrible or annoying or poorly written but it was also not interesting thought provoking or entertaining if you're into memoirs from death row then it's a fine read but that's purely all it is so don't expect anything more","826":"boring slow unlikable i could not get through a quarter of this book what a waste of $ and time","827":" as elizabeth l silver's debut novel opens one crucial fact is made abundantly clear inmate noa p singleton sits on pennsylvania's death row awaiting execution for a crime that she committed it's the why behind her actions and not the question of her guilt or innocence that remains woefully unanswered with just six months to go until her execution date could the sudden appearance of her victim's mother and the promise of clemency she carries with her hold the key to unlocking the mystery behind noa's actions oh if only things were ever that simple read more http www typographicalera com the e","828":" i really wanted to like this the premise had a lot of promise but silver's overwrought writing and the incomprehensible characters turned me off about half way through the author wasn't honest about the motivations of any of her characters i was particularly annoyed with oliver the pro bono attorney who simply up and left when fired by marlene after having been characterized as very involved and optimistic about noa's chances for a reprieve and marlene was just plain crazy manipulating everyone including her daughter which does not allow much room for psychological understanding ultimately very disappointing","829":" i wanted to like this book so much and i was so excited when it arrived i was disappointed this novel is chock full of purple prose and excessive metaphors to the point of distraction nothing about it seemed realistic the story makes it seem like we execute inmates all the time which we really don't and particularly not in pennsylvania where the author takes great pains to constantly remind you is where the story is set i wanted to like or understand noa but i neither liked nor understood her i couldn't empathize with her at all and really couldn't stand any of the characters in the story the novel read pretty quickly though i just wish i'd been given more to care about","830":"excellent wanted to keep reading to see the ending","831":"i wanted to like this i thought the writing was good as was the premise about a woman on death row but i jut didn't like it i think it was too dark for my liking and all of the characters were more bad than good someone them d no good in them at all i'm glad i read it but it kind of made my tummy hurt","832":"a drama that is human and sad you fall under its spell of avg people who act on their own needs and perceptions creating their crooked live's paths","833":"this book is about a woman who is on death row and what she did to get there surprising ending my daughter loved it","834":"great book about a woman on death row and a last ditch effort by the victims mother to try and gain her clemency in exchange for the reason why her daughter was murdered the victim's mother has some serious control issues and manages to find a way to call all the shots and is never happy with the way things turn out and can't face the truth when she hears it anyway","835":"i absolutely loved this book it has been a long time that a book grabbed me from the beginning and kept me on my toes from start to finish highly recommend","836":"i wanted to like this book but i just didn't i found the story compelling but the characters unlikeable unsympathetic and incomprehensible i didn't understand why they did what they did but i wished they'd all die","837":"well written but depressing","838":"a really quick read it took me maybe five or six hours to get through the whole thing that doesn't meant the book is easy none of the characters are likable and you're left with a dissatisfied feeling at the end no one gets what they want nothing is solved and things remain a mystery i suppose that's kind of like a trial where things are less about truth and more about different interpretations of the truth","839":"this had sounded promising when i read a review but this was a time that i gave it an hour and gave up could not get interested in the character or her situation my current life is too full to spend time reading a book that does not grab me if some of my friends read and like it maybe i will try again some time","840":"on the fence on how much i enjoyed this book i liked how the author started with noa on death row and slowly revealed the details of her life and then the true actions that lead to her conviction didn't care too much for noa which made it difficult to want to keep reading","841":"a random pick off the shelf turned out to be a surprisingly good one","842":"misplaced guilt by the protagonist leaves her apathetic about her future silver captures very complex emotional detriment","843":"this book is more of a 2 5 star rating it's an easy read that flows along smoothly and interestingly enough there was just a little bit of lackluster quality to it i wanted it to go deeper into the story than it did at times but not bad overall for a book you can read in one day","844":"disappointing noa is totally lacking any emotion u0026amp is not very likeable","845":"meet noa p singleton a young woman on death row she has been sentenced to death due to the charge of capital murder meaning the killing of two people in this case the killing of another young woman and her unborn child it is six months before x day as she calls it and suddenly marlene dixon shows up with another lawyer oliver from london or ollie as noa ends up calling him marlene wants to know what actually happened that fateful night that she lost her daughter to the murderer noa and is hoping that she will open up to oliver so the two start meeting and talking about noa's life over the next five months before x day and oliver learns more about noa that he bargained for marlene is still unable to deal with the death of her only child and begins to write letters to her dead daughter about what is happening now to noa and how marlene is trying to find the truth which she is so determined to know noa begins to tell oliver of her life she starts at the beginning of her life with her birth to her parents her odd parents one who is a wannabe star and the other a runaway noa then goes into her mother's long line of men that she dates and or marries through noa's lifetime then moves onto her best friend school graduating going to penn state meeting her father and then the meeting of marlene and then sarah with many twists and turns in through all of this noa lays out her life for ollie and the two become close but are they close enough for noa to finally tell what really happened that night trying to get more out of noa oliver brings in all of the court records for noa to go over hoping that she will tell the truth of what happened leading up to and during the death of sarah and her unborn child oliver hopes that by noa seeing all of the testimonies all over again will help her to see what others thought of her and will convince her to tell the truth and to clear her name but as noa goes over the records she starts to drift back to those days in court and the people that were present her lawyers those from her childhood and those in her adult years as well as marlene and her father she starts to recall the jurors and the way they reacted to the testimonies every word uttered and every movement made she starts to recall again the pain and agony of that time in her life will the truth come out will it set noa p singleton free this book as amazing a little slow to begin with and was unsure of where the story was going to go but once noa started to talk about her life and the events that lead up to fateful event that changed noa's life forever very well written and i liked seeing the story from multiple points of view noa's as she went through her life first third person when noa and oliver were talking to each other and marlene's letters to sarah so very interesting the thoughts and emotions that were evoked through this story i enjoyed how noa contemplated her life and what her last words should be and how she would say them how she contemplated others in her place and what they did before they died such a powerful book with so many twists and turns one never did know where the next chapter would take them in the journey through noa's life i would like to thank read it forward for my arc copy of this book as well as the author elizabeth l silver for writing and allowing read it forward to give away an arc copy","846":"noa p singleton was tried for murder convicted and sentenced to death without testifying on her behalf elizabeth l silver has noa admit right away that she is in fact guilty of her crime in the execution of noa p singleton but the truth of what led up to the murder is so much more nuanced than anybody knew just months before her execution the mother of her victim shows up with a young lawyer and plans to get a clemency hearing the mother really wants answers and the lawyer legitimately wants to help every time you think you might have things figured out a new twist comes along as noa finally decides to share her story you can by turns feel protective of noa and then deeply disturbed by her walking a fine line between loving and hating her nobody wins in this story but it is utterly thought provoking","847":"very disappointing so much did not make sense the character of the victim was not at all developed which made the crime too puzzling to care about the perpetrator the device of the mother writing a letter to her dead daughter was a ridiculous way to add details to the plot also way over blown prose and out of conrol metaphors","848":"this one kept me reading all night long and i have already recommended it to a friend","849":"got a new computer an all in one and wasn't able to get into goodreads from there so i've saved up several books that i've read this year and can now log them in for some reason this book really caught and held my attention not sure why it was a nice book but not an exceptional one however once i started reading it i stayed up until dawn to finish","850":"the writing was interesting and i wanted to finish the book but my overall feeling at the end was just wellllllll alrighty then","851":"holy crap what a book","852":"a 2013 staff fiction favorite recommended by melissa h and connie check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","853":"i love an unreliable narrator and this was one as unreliable as they come despite everything i still found myself hoping she wasn't as guilty i loved the flashbacks her internal monologue and this vivid prison scenes i couldn't turn the pages fast enough very well done","854":"i thought the book was well written i found the story interesting but no compelling reason why noa gave up and did not fight against the charges also no clear reason why marlene started the clemency petition so that is why only 3 stars","855":"i loved the angles that e silver took to deliver this story it was unique this novel bespeaks how each of us has a responsibility for the others we encounter in our lives","856":" in her debut novel the execution of noa p singleton elizabeth l silver introduces the reader to the title character six months before her scheduled execution date for the next 300 or so pages silver presents a woman resolved past care distant thoughtful and damaged with a plot that twists and doubles back revealing lies and truths and the things that shape noa for good or ill on that day six months before what noa p singleton terms 'x day ' in walks high powered female lawyer marlene dixon along with oliver another lawyer in her firm to build a clemency case what makes marlene different from the other parade of lawyers noa will talk about through the novel is that she is the mother of sarah the woman noa has been convicted of killing the opening chapters leave the reader with questions as to intent and while those questions are resolved by the end it doesn't do so with pretty bows the prologue in the opening paragraph sets up one of the themes of the novel in this world you are either good or evil if not then a court or a teacher or a parent is bound to rage your identity before you've had a chance to figure it out on your own the gray middle ground the mucous thin terrain where most of life resides is really only a temporary annex like gestation or purgatory... it waits for you patiently until the day it wraps you in its cyclone and you can no longer vacillate between black and white artist or scientist teacher or student it is this point at which you much choose one way of life or the other victor or victim the turns of plot the reveals of information and the gradual details of character painted as the story moves along reinforce the idea of that vacillation between extremes only to land squarely in the gray as a former literature teacher i always wanted my students to think about narration especially first person narration and readers should here the unreliable narrator yes mr poe i talking to you... comes into play here not once but twice sprinkled in through the narration of noa are letters from marlene to her dead daughter marlene has her own agenda -- ostensibly to learn what noa has revealed to no one what actually happened on the day sarah died but the letters to her dead daughter bring that too into question the novel is about how one women not a stereotypical murderer comes to be on death row and how she faces her execution and her past as well as being a story of mothers and fathers the things people do for love for self preservation to survive and to expunge guilt the characters are well drawn and fortunately unlike many first person pov novels the voice of noa is distinctive maybe not holden caulfield or ishmael but distinct all the same some readers have complained about silver's use of metaphors and simile but while i found them hit or miss they seemed more about the character of noa than about silver's prose beyond that the narrative moved quickly covering the whole of noa's life and doling out just enough to keep an astute reading reevaluating and putting the puzzle together certainly without standing on a soapbox silver does make the audience think about the death penalty as a lawyer silver paints a good picture of the justice system particularly about the various cliches of death row defense and appeals the description of noa's life behind bars is well done -- the three musketeer's bar incident and descriptions of patsmith's nightly ritual are good examples of that but by no stretch is the novel about death row or the moral implications of the death penalty -- not a variation on \"dead man walking\" or \"life of david gayle\" -- but it is enough to make a reader think about 'big' ideas like guilt and innocence class and privilege and 'the system' the narration and questions about the veracity of both the stories of marlene and noa brings in another level where i found that i questioned what came before that made me see noa in different light there is a reveal of information where for me there was transition between victim and victor or victor and victim depending on how you want to see things ultimately the book is about memory and perception about lies we tell others and ourselves of how we interpret stories we hear and how we alter stories we retell","857":"i was not impressed by this book not what i was expecting","858":"the book had an interesting concept but i didn't like the character noa or the marlene noa would rather face death for the mistakes that she made in the past but not for the actual crime that she was put to death for marlene dixon manipulated her way out of taking responsibility for her involvement in her daughter's death would be a good lifetime movie though","859":"one star one word ugh","860":" i read this in response to stellar reviews that for some reason i cannot find now maybe in the washington post anyway sure it's a corker silver has chosen a unique and compelling premise the switching of narratives is subtle and strong overall fits together quite nicely but perhaps too convenient for the reader one thing i will say is this if you're going to write a story about humanity actually make the characters human there was nothing sound in their decision making all irrationally selfish it just became a pain to read because of that problem no matter what all people have some good in them reveal that and you have my and many other people's interest","861":"i bought this on a whim in the sale at waterstones and wasn't expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised it charts the last six months of a death row prisoner flitting between current time and past events a good showing of the flaws in human characters","862":"i have mixed feelings about this book i read it in one sitting last evening but cannot say that i liked it the story is noa's life told while in the final 7 months of her stint on death row she is approached by the mother of the woman she killed who only wants to know why she killed her daughter and her associate lawyer oliver oliver is the one noa finally opens up to after 10 years of silence on death row noa is very gritty her story is odd and harsh and she doesn't try to prettify it up i think the problem i had with this book was i had read somewhere about a twist in the story and in my mind that meant a twist like the kind in the books by gillian flynn sharp objects gone girl problem is those are psychological thrillers and only at the end of the book i realized this was a mystery this could be the absolute first mystery book i've ever read so when we got to the \"big reveal\" i was completely underwhelmed well written intriguing characters...if you like mysteries pick this up","863":"a pitiless riveting narrative an unsettling fascinating read","864":" it's like gone girl and we need to talk about kevin had a baby and one which lacked the language skills and literary style of its parents so just attempted to copy those styles onto a story that lacks the gravity or over the top surrealism to plant it firmly in either camp it started off well enough with a familiarly close mouthed but seemingly falsely accused female and goes on from there and on and on silver really wants us to appreciate her ear for the poetic so her prose is quite overwrought in places similes where they needn't be popping up throughout like dandelions in an overgrown garden you know another book where everyone is an a$$hole and there's no one to root for it can work see the parents of this book i mentioned earlier but here it doesn't and when everything shakes out it's almost boring given the lack of sympathy or emotion i have for anyone between the covers","865":" i couldn't tear myself away from this novel it opens with noa p singleton inmate number 10271978 in the pennsylvania institute for women introducing herself and telling us that i pulled the trigger post conviction i never contested that once she is on death row and nearing her execution date noa is unnervingly calm as she begins to tell us the back story she is adamant about her guilt and sees the past ten years spent in prison and her impending execution as the logical outcome of her crime the murder of pregnant sarah dixon she isn't even particularly ruffled when high powered attorney marlene dixon sarah's mother visits her to announce that she no longer believes in the death penalty and will be pursuing a clemency petition for noa marlene just wants to know why why did noa shoot her daughter noa has never answered this question publicly and does not intend to now noa's story is so knotted and convoluted that it takes the entire book to tease it out this novel is about identity self identity and imposed identity and about all of the little and enormous factors that go into making us who we are or at least the factors that propel us to a certain place and time and point of action the opening passage sets the tone beautifully in this world you are either good or evil if not then a court or a teacher or a parent is bound to tag your identity before you've had a chance to figure it out on your own the gray middle ground that mucous thin terrain where most of life resides is really only a temporary annex like gestation or purgatory silver makes the point again so precisely and dexterously in chapter eight one of the quickest changes you experience when entering prison isn't the compulsory adjustment to the food or square footage or the privacy you lack during your odd numbered days in the showers it's not even the rapid loss of the former friends and family of your life rather it's the internal acceptance that finally you have become the person you were meant to be when you enter true you are given a new number new residence and new wardrobe but it is only when you place those garments upon your limbs that you realize they were designed for no one but you no former splinters of your personality carry over into prison life no relationships fictional or otherwise accompany them either any superficial intimacy you claim to have experienced with another whether consanguineous or not when you wore any color other than cocoa brown fades as quickly as a puff of cigar smoke you are now the person everyone knows you to be i was impressed that silver stuck to the humanity factor of such a hot button political issue in telling noa's story she does not tackle the morality of capital punishment directly she never asks us explicitly if noa deserves to be on death row she doesn't push us to judge feel as you will about capital punishment but consider the person consider the process and then maybe consider it all a little further noa p singleton is subtle complex and quite stunning","866":"this was definitely an interesting read it wasn't exactly what i expected but it was a book that i would recommend to people who like psychological mysteries one of the things i enjoyed most about the novel was the way it unfolded the reader really doesn't get too much information at the beginning and the protagonist and narrator noa doesn't give too much away only as the story moves forward to we start to get glimpses of what really happened to noa and sarah this way of telling a story creates lots of tension which makes for a very interesting read the writing for the most part is lovely there were some phrases that i found a bit overdone but that might just be personal taste all in all it was a book that is hard to put down once you start it if you like unreliable narrators and psychological mysteries then this one is for you","867":"read due to book review recommendation did not love","868":"excellent read it in 3 days could not put it down anxious to hear the author's thoughts this week","869":"i can't decide if i liked this book and that seems to be the general feeling from other readers it definitely was a page turner and kept me interested but not really because i thought it was great i wanted to find out the details of why noa was on death row and that happened at the very end i would not recommend this book","870":"make me care it was hard for me to care about noa since she didn't care about herself took too long to find out why she didn't care whether she lived or died","871":"simply awful writing","872":" the execution of noa p singleton is elizabeth l silver's debut novel silver grabs the reader's attention from the opening pages you must choose one way of life or the other victor or victim and when you do the fear drips away as seamlessly as a river drains into an ocean for me it happened on january 2003 i was lucid attentive mentally sound and pumped with a single cup of decaffeinated lemon zinger tea when i pulled the trigger and simply doesn't let us go noa is sitting on death row convicted of a crime that is only slowly unravelled and exposed chapter by chapter or is it noa is not a reliable story teller does she have a faulty memory or is it just selective is she choosing to lie and prevaricate or can she not remember what is fact and what is fiction as her execution date draws near and a young lawyer seeks to help her she recounts her life and the path that led her to the cell she now sits in initially i found noa quite unlikeable my opinion changed many times over the course of the book as more is revealed but again it is hard to discern what is real versus what truth noa wants us to see or accept the addition of letters from the victim's mother sent my emotions and thoughts spinning in yet another direction but is she herself victim or victor the other characters are just as complex as noa in their recountings and motives silver brilliantly explores relationships in this dark psychological tale she also provides a commentary on the legal system and the death penalty that is sure to spark discussion silver is an attorney silver masterfully plays with the reader in this debut i was kept off kilter and unsettled as the countdown continued to x day noa's own term i turned the last page and just stopped did i like the ending what would i have liked to have happen the execution of noa p singleton is an incredibly strong debut elizabeth l silver has a long literary career ahead of her one i'll be following","873":"you'll want to finish this book quickly because you will want to know what motivated noa interesting read that kept me on the edge of my seat but also a bit confused","874":" i sat on a jury once it was a murder trial in which a man was accused of murdering his live in girlfriend both had been drinking extensively and engaged in a domestic dispute he killed his girlfriend beating her with his hands and feet and a hand held vacuum cleaner i found the entire criminal court process interesting i had worked in a courtroom for years but only in the juvenile dependency court so the criminal case was a new experience for me the information that could be entered into evidence the way the attorneys made their arguments the instructions to the jury i came away from that experience feeling a bit disillusioned and not too confident in the entire jury trial process at least not in the case i heard it's hard to be when no one cares about the juror sleeping off a hangover during testimony or the jury foreman who asked his fellow jurors to keep in mind the defendant's age when condemning him to prison time despite having just been instructed by the judge not to take that into consideration because it wasn't relevant to whether he had in fact committed first degree murder and so noa p singleton's story was not surprising i have worked with a variety of attorneys over the years some inexperienced others burnt out or apathetic they were mixed in with the good ones one of my favorite juvenile court attorneys was a court appointed one not a private attorney brought in from the outside so the stereotype of court appointed attorneys not being the best advocates for their clients isn't always true that's neither here nor there in terms of the book however what most stood out for me was noa's experience with the court process and how unfortunately realistic it was portrayed it's clear from the novel that the author is well versed in criminal law and the ins and outs of the courtroom particularly in criminal cases involving someone without much money i was caught up in noa's tale right from the start the novel is told from her perspective in first person with the occasional pause for letters written by marlene dixon to her daughter the murder victim the two narratives offer a glimpse into both noa's mind and marlene's their stories are intertwined right from the start their relationship is an interesting one one that creates more suspicion at first rather than understanding the author has a gift for only offering a piece of the mystery of how and why sarah was killed here and there keeping the suspense building and the reader wanting to know more neither noa or marlene are particularly likeable characters neither are very reliable as narratives or are they it's a question that i kept asking myself as i continued to read i never really connected with noa being isolated on death row had given her a lot of time to reflect on her life and the direction it had taken we learn about her childhood and her relationship with her parents particularly her absent father who suddenly reappears in her life she hadn't had an easy life and i could see how her behavior and attitudes led her to make the decisions she did still i never quite got a handle on her she seemed disconnected from her own life and the people in it was this a reflection of her current situation and isolation or was it really a part of who she was marlene brought in her own complications she said she had a change of heart about the death penalty but noa suspected an ulterior motive from the start and as the reader i did too it was in the way marlene presented herself and the words that came out of her mouth i just didn't trust her truth be told i trusted noa more i admit going into the novel i expected a rather fast read but i didn't find it to be so elizabeth l silver is a descriptive writer whether that was a part of noa's character or just silver's style i am not sure add to that the fact that the reader spends so much time in noa's head philosophizing and analyzing things it slowed the pacing of the book down at times i didn't mind at all as i found it interesting but other times i wished i could hurry the book along i really wanted to get to the truth what happened to sarah why was she killed what was noa's role and what about the motive all of this remains a mystery until the end of the book and although by then the truth comes less as a surprise there are still some surprises to be had when i finished reading the execution of noa p singleton i wasn't immediately sure what i thought of the book on the one hand i did enjoy it on the other i felt a bit unsatisfied ultimately though i am glad i read the novel and feel that as a whole it was a worthwhile book one that is particularly thought provoking review book provided by publisher","875":"very good mystery not quite as good as last year's gone girl but very enjoyable","876":"good reading wasn't predictable at the end so that was good","877":"really good book keeps you on your toes the whole time","878":"good book but difficult to follow in spots","879":"good twists towards the end of the book","880":"i enjoyed this book but found it dragged at times","881":"#compntbkborrowed from library fs in this world you are either good or evil ls but everyday it is with me when i drive my car when i got to work when i climb the stairs to the courthouse when i wait in a crowded elevator when i present at a meeting before 40 business people the bracelet is always fastened around my wrist forever yours and only yours mom","882":"noa singleton is on death row for murdering sarah dixon she did not defend herself at trial or on appeal and it is six months until the execution a new lawyer shows up trying to get her clemency and to get the story out of her though the book is generally too long noa's past is fascinating and the truth of what happened at sarah's death and before and after is unexpected it's not brilliant but it's worth a read","883":"a bit unnerving wanted to smack half of the characters the ending makes it somewhat worth the desperation i felt","884":"noa has never spoken in her own defense as to why she killed sarah dixon did she in fact kill her with six months to live sarah's mother wants to know what happened this book is pretty good attempt at a psychological thriller what events in noa's past led to sarah's death unfortunately there was a little too much coincidence in the narrative which made it a stretch for me to believe what happened","885":"i don't understand the hype around this one i felt very detached from the main character noa p singleton herself and the unpredictable twist meh","886":" this novel was enjoyable to read but the ending left me ultimately unsatisfied i don't require a tidy conclusion but i do want to have insight into the motives of the main characters and noa baffled me even in the end noa was on death row awaiting execution for murdering her father's girlfriend the mother of the victim marlene dixon was an attorney and she visits her shortly before her execution date with a puzzling offer of clemency this woman was a most unlikeable character...to say the least i was never quite convinced that her offer was genuine and her motivation was never clearly disclosed...in my opinion i was bewildered by some of noa's actions as well she had a cynical personality and often inappropriately blase about her dire situation in addition the secrets that were gradually revealed about her past were very interesting but failed to clarify any rationale for her refusal to defend herself against the charges that put her on death row even with these flaws the book was appealing and it held my interest until the very end","887":"a fascinating study about the nuances of guilt and innocence this one kept me up all night trying to peel the layers back to discover the truth of what happened on new year's day who truly bears the guilt a stunning debut","888":"intriguing and real kept my attention the entire time","889":"book club rating 2 9","890":" there are some good things about this book silver is an assured storyteller and the story moves along at a nice pace at times particularly in the beginning of the book a few overwrought similes threatened to keep me from going the main issue i had was the implausibility of a few plot points everything with persephone and what happened in sarah's apartment i can see how the two things are connected how one informs the other but i didn't fully buy it sometimes a simple explanation is best and most believable and i found that this didn't quite ring true the thrust of the story seems to be that noa doesn't truly deserve to be executed but based on her actions i can't say that's exactly true","891":"disappointing not very suspenseful didn't like or really care about any of the characters and felt no sense of any real motivation holding things together i almost didn't finish it but really thought it would get better","892":" this would be a great book club book beyond the mystery of what exactly happened the day that sarah died the question of who noa is and of what it means to be innocent and guilty take center stage noa's story unspools in the present and in the past allowing the reader to see how she arrived in sarah's apartment with a gun on that fateful new year's day and all the choices of all the other guilty parties which directly influenced what transpired i particularly appreciated how noa's behavior was explained by others she shares the list of diagnoses she's received and yet the reader knows from the very beginning that noa has never actually explained what happened so how can others presume to understand her motivations this is a story as much about what is not said as what is said about parenting about failing to parent about secrets about guilt about family and love about how the things that happen to us shape our lives and can ruin us if we let them it's also a story about the death sentence without being overtly pro or against but the reader will have to think about whether justice was served in this case or not","893":"honestly i am conflicted about this book and couldn't decide between two or three stars i settled on three because it was decent enough that i felt compelled to finish it the story telling was solid but the conclusion of the story left me wanting more","894":"riveting and reaming","895":"this was an ok read it was a good story but the characters were underdeveloped in my opinion","896":" disclaimer i have prosecuted many murder cases including one death penalty case and worked with far too many people who have lost loved ones to murder and my review's objectivity should be questionedthere are many aspects about this book that make it worth more than my rating of 3 stars it is well written there is suspense throughout the novel there are surprises complex characters especially the narrator and it provokes thought the plot is intriguing a woman on death row noah is visited by the victim's mother a high powered lawyer who has changed her mind about wanting noah executed who has now started an organization against the death penalty the novel effectively shifts back and forth in time from noah's early life to the trial back to the events before the murder and back and forth to her time on death rowspoiler alert my discussion of my criticisms of the book include details about the ending my objections to this novel are the novel's values and in the guise of being a realistic courtroom drama uses unrealistic devices to further those values first of all we learn that noah was guilty she shot the victim intending to kill her because noah would be in trouble if the victim lived and told authorities what she knew about noah yes there are issues that cause some sympathy to noah and in real life would serve as mitigating factors to prevent the death penalty in a vast majority of states but i challenge the reader to find sympathy for the innocent victim and she is a completely innocent victim while the novel is compelling in its sympathetic portrait of noah second the portrayed villain in the narrative is the victim's mother she collected evidence for noah's clemency petition but did not file the petition but concealed the evidence she also blackmailed noah's father to prevent him from giving favorable evidence at trial and the capital sentencing phase and then blackmailed the young idealistic lawyer she had hired to help her help noah when he becomes too effective while this device adds dramatic tension it is unrealistic to believe anyone would have the power the mother had in this novel and her motivation of wanting to learn details about her daughter's novel does not make sense given the high risk she was taking in obstructing justice the concealing of clemency evidence and blackmailing a witness to withhold evidence again i challenge the reader to find evidence in this novel of any sympathy or compassion for a mother whose only daughter was murderedagain this is a well written book with suspense and as this review shows provokes thought however its use of unrealistic dramatic plot points to further questionable value statements made it an unsatisfactory read for me","897":"so many similes and metaphors i found myself rolling my eyes as i read weak story that tries too hard","898":"seriously hard to put down","899":"this was one of those books that had a great premise but disappointed i hated all of the characters they were all terrible people and i never felt sorry or even intrigued by any of them blech","900":"in a stunning debut elizabeth l silver has written an unforgettable gripping novel where guilt innocence good and bad are words that occupy a murky gray area dealing with subjects such as capital punishment and the hell of living on death row this remarkable work is ultimately an examination of the human soul ms silver is definitely a writer with a bright literary future","901":"2 5 stars this book never paid off for me however i have learned two things from this book 1 if the author photograph looks as if it were styled and shot by danielle steele's photographer i will put the book down and walk away kidding 2 if the author bio states that the author possesses an mfa from anywhere i will put the book down and walk away as 9 out of 10 times this book included what will follow will be an exercise in self aggrandizement i want to be in love with the story not in love with the fact that you as the author are in love with your perceived ability to string words together totally not kidding this one was a big disappointment for me","902":"while this book certainly had a few flaws i really enjoyed it the story and characters were very engaging i was surprised by how much i sympathized with noa as she reveals anecdotes from her life that have led to her place on death row with her execution looming it's a very fast paced book and once i was hooked i couldn't put it down","903":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked the multiple povs but the technique of using marlene's letters to sarah as a way to reveal key plot details seemed weird just because the letters were written as a scene complete with dialogue maybe i am just a lazy letter writer but i would never write such detailed letters to a dead person write about my feelings sure but a blow by blow replay nah other than that noa was a complex character but some of her motivations seemed foggy i wished i had seen the correlation between i liked the multiple povs but the technique of using marlene's letters to sarah as a way to reveal key plot details seemed weird just because the letters were written as a scene complete with dialogue maybe i am just a lazy letter writer but i would never write such detailed letters to a dead person write about my feelings sure but a blow by blow replay nah other than that noa was a complex character but some of her motivations seemed foggy i wished i had seen the correlation between her past experiences to her crime more clearly i mean it was implied sure but those past experiences still didn't 100% explain her decision to murder sarah the persephone accident disappeared but she had to have known this one wouldn't was she trying to take the fall for her dad or did she just panic who knows anyway kept me entertained and offered a look into life on death row and futile clemency appeals and the complexities behind assigning blame for murder when many factors come into play more","904":"couldn't put this down though ending was slightly anticlimactic definitely would recommend regardless","905":"an intriguing character study infused with a plot that meanders between the past and the present reading carefully is a must to gain the clues to noa oliver and maureen the interweaving of the plot leaves the reader hoping for more information in a later segment however that information doesn't always appear fortunately i read some reviews when i was almost finished with this book because no matter how carefully written the reviews revealed some of the plot i hope i did not here","906":"this story is told by noa a lady who is on death row for murdering another woman the murdered woman's mother who is a lawyer brings an employee fresh out of law school with her to visit noa in prison saying that the mother doesn't believe in the death penalty anymore and wants to change noa's sentence i still don't know how i feel about this book i finished it a week ago and just waited to see how i felt a little while after reading it the book was engaging and i read it straight through the book is unsettling but it also didn't seem terribly depressing we learn how a woman on death row feels when she knows when the exact date and time of her own death will be i won't spoil it by saying if we find out if she actually committed the crime or if her sentence got commuted this one was really hard to rate i won this book through bookbrowse com","907":"another grabber of a story makes you really think about the death penalty and the conflict of interest when the victim's relative is also a powerful attorney frustrating ending though","908":"the first few paragraphs almost turned me off due to the lofty arrogant wording but i kept going i really enjoyed the story but did not like the ending at all i saw it coming but i'd hoped i was wrong i really do not understand at all why noa chose to trust a person who clearly was not trustworthy so that ruined it for me but i'd still recommend the book for the story between the first few paragraphs and the last few paragraphs","909":" 3 5 starsintriguing and provocative story without any moral head bashing the reader can't help but think about capital punishment and in particular women who commit murder the characters are each complex and not always likable this is not a book where you are rooting for someone to triumph or survive you know from the title that doesn't happen the story is not about what occurs but about why the plot raises more questions than it answers there is a lot of built in ambiguity some of which bothered me in particular the victim's mother is very hard to get a read on a very compelling read and well written the first page alone will draw you in with its intelligence and powers of desscription","910":"the execution of noa p singleton was a very interesting and unique book its about a woman noa p singleton who is on death row for killing a pregnant woman its told in the first person by noa herself she is unapologetic and seemingly unremoreseful she has 6 months left till her execution date during her time in prison she has had very few visitors save the media and attorneys then she is visited by marlene dixon the mother of the woman she is on death row for killing and a high powered attorney she says she has had a change of heart and no long believes in the death penalty and wants to help noa's sentence be commuted to life imprisonment instead marlene brings with her a young man named oliver to help her they want her to tell her story on the reason that it will help them in building the case that could spare her life the story is told in the form of journal entries and noa speaks of her life on death row the tedium of being kept in a cell for 23 hours of the day and allowed outside for 1 hour she seems to be indifferent to this as she seems to be about everything marlene does add another voice later in the book as she begins to write letters to her deceased daughter sarah and in these letters you begin to see a very calculating and vindictive person this creates another level to the mystery and you begin to start questioning what really happened noa begins to tell her life story to oliver slowly unfurling to him a far more complex person than he originally thought he begins to do his own investigating and what he discovers leads him to believe that noa didn't get a fair shake and hopes to try and get her a new trial with what he uncovers i have noticed that a lot of people seemed to dislike this book or only slightly like it mostly because of the vagueness and indifference of noa and not enough from the other characters i disagree with this i found the book to be written in a very unique and haunting voice and wonder if this is what might be expected of a woman who was this close to her execution on death row i think its that people want a more \"likeable\" character in noa or they want her to be a true sociopath what they find is neither of these but a woman who is resigned indifferent bored its only in her journal that the story of what happened begins to fully unfold her father finding her just shortly before the murder the victim his young lover a girl her age that he met while he was trying to track her down she learns about sarah when she meets marlene who wants her to break the two of them up because she doesn't feel noa's father is good enough for her daughter more and more layers begin to develop as the story progresses i found it to be a very complex story told in a very authentic voice i would not be surprised to find there are many in prison that would have a similar tone noa would be barely likeable to most people as she doesn't even seem to care much about her father or anyone else in her life so in that way she was a sociopath but she was not only lacking in empathy but lacking in emotion almost entirely its a haunted tale about how things are rarely how they appear and guilt and innocence are often a multi layered thing on the same coin its an excellent novel and even more so given its a first novel well worth the time to read i for one will watch for the next book from this young author http sephipiderwitch com the execut sephipiderwitchfebruary 2015","911":"tense and amazing much like nick and amy in gone girl noa is unlikable and horrible yet i couldn't not find out if she was protecting someone and what marlene's intentions were","912":"noa p singleton is on death row but does she belong there whether you are for or against capital punishment does this particular inmate deserve death noa believes she does but not necessarily for the reasons presented to the jury this would make a great book club discussion","913":" i have rarely felt such ambivalence regarding a book i found the characters totally lacking they all seemed either unlikable or empty whether it was this preternaturally bleak aspect or something else indefinably amiss by the end i was more than ready to part company it is hard to say what it is about this book that left me dissatisfied disliking the characters does not necessarily lead to my disliking the book but in this case it did towards the end of the book and by the final resolution i was left wondering what the whole point was i have no problem when evil triumphs but i like for there to have been a point a logical lead up to the conclusion","914":"amazing some really beautiful writing and a story that took me by surprise till the very end every time i thought i knew what was going on it took another turn excellent first novel","915":" it took me a minute to get into this book but once you're about 25% in you can't put it down it was overall a really good mystery but i felt bad for noa i despised marlene and caleb they all had contributed to what happened but were totally fine with the blame completely going onto noa not that she wasn't innocent but they definitely were the ones who got the ball rolling and set up the chain of events the final chapter and letter was quite telling my marlene very intriguing book and kept me wondering what actually happened","916":"this is one everyone should read you'll get sucked into her story but still be able to remain impartial lots of twists it's a quick read because you do not want to put it down","917":" this novel was spectacular in a subtle creeping way this is a riveting story about human behavior and motivations and violent crimes it encouraged thoughtful analysis of the death penalty and the legal system i enjoy good legal novels but unlike other novels that cover the death penalty in a sensational way i e just off the top of my head john grisham's the confession elizabeth silver manages to convey a depth and complexity to the circumstances and characters such that you cannot simply say this system failed or this person failed the basic premise is that noa p singleton will be executed in six months for the murder of her estranged father's pregnant girlfriend sarah there is no debate on this point noa never denies shooting sarah sarah's mother marlene a superstar attorney has had a change of heart regarding noa's death sentence and wants to petition the governor for noa's clemency when noa begins to tell stories of her childhood and her past leading up to the murder the story really began to surprise me this is a novel not simply about noa's crime but how she got to that moment what informed her decisions in life and what motivated her to stay silent and not speak to her own defense the ending of noa's story completely blindsided me i was not in any way prepared for or anticipating the p story though the novel started slowly i became mesmerized and attached to the story and the characters and wanted to know the why's why did marlene want to help noa would oliver truly stand by his commitment to justice and help noa what role does noa's father caleb have in this story and crime and ultimately noa why oh why oh why oh why this was a satisfying though very serious read and i would recommend it to those who enjoy thoughtful legal novels","918":"i was pretty underwhelmed by this book perhaps because i'd had such great things about it being a suspenseful tale of a woman on death row the story flits between the current day with noa a woman in her mid thirties counting down the days to her execution and her traipse into the past to recount the events that led her to where she is now there is a slight hint that all may not be as it seems which is intended to drive the narrative but i found that not enough happened and that noa wasn't an interesting or believable enough character to sustain my interest i also found the style of writing incredibly grating perhaps the author was trying to create a unique voice for noa but it came across as pretentious and a little unrealistic given that noa has spent 10 years of her life and jail and never even finished college","919":"just finished this book and i've been thinking about it all day","920":"excellent i hated the ending but loved the book","921":"i thought i was going to love this book it reminds me of we need to talk about kevin only it didn't suck the prose is written so you have to take it slow and read closely which i really liked but the last 100 pages killed the book for me i just ended up hating the ending i didn't really like any of the characters which i guess is understandable and i just didn't particularly enjoy the book shrug","922":"the book lacks a linear narrative a single likable character or even a cohesive theme i presume it is intended as some sort of weighty exploration of the issues surrounding the death penalty but the author dives into the murky waters surrounding executions without an ounce of panache the plot twists are nonsensical and hard to follow there are no clear cut answers at the end either and long self indulgent and mundane soliloquies by noa and marlene throughout skip it","923":"a multi threaded tale that moves along at a frantic pace this novel is full of thought provoking ideas some are actually on the pages others are merely suggested leaving the introspection up to the reader nowhere is this more evident than when the novel comes to an end that seems an abrupt surprise even though the countdown is evident on every page not for the reader who wants all the loose ends tied up neatly by the sensibilities of the author","924":"very well written book that was fresh unpredictable and engaging it is not the usual political novel on the death penalty which i try to avoid i was amazed at the creative story and the strong writing i will definitely look for future books from this first time author","925":"a dark story of the events leading up to a murder from the perspective of the inmate waiting to die on death row","926":"lyrical prose fast moving story line and a main character that you can neither love nor hate i enjoyed this read and would recommend to those interested in psychological thrillers","927":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2013 06","928":"a very well organized story about a woman on death row in pa it's a mystery wrapped thoughtfully in the judicial system as it relates to criminal acts and the death penalty it's actually more about the life of noa p singleton and how she got on the row in the first place i especially enjoyed meeting the author at mysterious galaxy while i was reading her book the story is truly unpredictable and a real page turner","929":"storyline was so so but i liked a lot of her thought processes","930":"this book seemed like it was going to be really good but it was so wordy which is even harder to deal w in audio","931":"very good read silver writes with a clear voice that is rich i read this book in less than 3 days i was so eager to know what happened next and where the next turn would take me as a reader the lyricism with which silver tackles a topic like the death penalty is uncanny there are issues she proposes without actually proposing them as problems this book was enjoyable and i would highly recommend it to anyone definitely glad i picked it up","932":"this is not the style book i like to read i finished it because i knew there was a smoking gun the smoking gun made the story even harder to read and understand the execution of noa p singleton was a book i did not like what i am not sure of is did i not like it because of the content or because of the book either way i did not enjoy this book if you enjoyed the dinner the house of sand and fog or the story of edgar sawtelle this book is going to be up your alley i did not like them but this book is very much like them","933":"it was ok not a summer read but not my favorite type of storyi never really liked anyone in this book i felt shame and pity for everyone so it does invoke feeling however i don't like reading books to feel shame and pity i just have to look at my own life","934":"$12 99 i paid for it the writing was bad a real mess of nonsensical similes and metaphors and some excruciating alliteration as i said in a comment to another review of this book it took me a week to read 291 pages something i normally could read in a day or two that is because the language caused me such irritation i repeatedly had to put the book down and do something else to give my brain a res i thought i was going to love this book but i didn't not at all in fact i am lamenting the $12 99 i paid for it the writing was bad a real mess of nonsensical similes and metaphors and some excruciating alliteration as i said in a comment to another review of this book it took me a week to read 291 pages something i normally could read in a day or two that is because the language caused me such irritation i repeatedly had to put the book down and do something else to give my brain a rest from trying to figure out what exactly the author was trying to convey not even wanting to know the ending would have kept me reading if i hadn't paid so much money for it otherwise i would have given up long before that last page just an utter disappointment","935":"more like the elimination of or the erasing of i keep flipping the back pages wanting to know what happened next surely something must have this is the kind of story where you keep going back and forth on whether someone should die and how things could have gone so horribly wrong with a failed system","936":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm not sure how i feel about this book i didn't hate it but i didn't really like it either noa p singleton is not a likable character however a character does not have to be likable to be intriguing and that is why i continued to turn page after page i was very curious to know the circumstances that led to noa's incarceration and death sentence as well as how marlene dixon was involved marlene dixon is also very unlikable marlene reminds me very much of glenn close's character the i'm not sure how i feel about this book i didn't hate it but i didn't really like it either noa p singleton is not a likable character however a character does not have to be likable to be intriguing and that is why i continued to turn page after page i was very curious to know the circumstances that led to noa's incarceration and death sentence as well as how marlene dixon was involved marlene dixon is also very unlikable marlene reminds me very much of glenn close's character the morally challenged attorney patty hewes from the tv show damages she does not come across as a devoted mother so it is impossible to feel any sympathy for her situation all of this being said i was glad that noa goes to her death without giving marlene the information she wants regarding sarah's murder marlene is looking for a way to assuage her own guilt and she thinks that a confession from noa explaining the events of her daughter's murder might provide her with some closure what doesn't make sense to me is that in order to keep sarah from blowing the whistle on her complicity in persephone riga's death noa shoots and kills her she commits one murder to keep another one a secret sarah tells noa that her father shared this secret with her i'm sorry but at what point did noa share her terrible persephone secret with her estranged father when he asks her what's the worst thing she's ever done she tells him that she was arrested for shoplifting once and that she dropped out of college it's one thing to keep the readers in the dark about what happened to persephone but it's not fair to shift gears without warning and suddenly two other characters are in possession of this information this is the basis for the entire story if sarah hadn't threatened to expose noa then noa wouldn't have killed her for me it was much too contrived to spring on readers at that point in the story more","937":"it was ok","938":"this is a 3 1 2 star review i was so exited that i won this book on first reads as the story line has so much promise i really wanted this to be a fantastic book but it only lived up my standard of good i think one of the story's main flaws wash feat that i found all of the characters unlikeable and i found myself unbothered by the outcome just a bit curios how the story might pan out the story started well but then moved into a lot of boring detail for example i didn't find it necessary to be given the details of the jury to me it added nothing to the story and to be honest i skim read a lot of the unnecessary detail i rather enjoyed the last third of the book that was a lot more fast paced and revealing all in all this was a good story that maybe i have judged to harshly i just like a storyline with character i can care about whether good bad or ugly","939":"slow to start but lots of surprises i didn't see coming the book felt like it took place in england and not philly i really enjoyed it","940":"elizabeth silver's writing kept me totally intrigued from both noa's and marlene's perspective oliver's character leaves me to ponder what might have been if very captivating read could not put the book down until i understood the web silver had spun","941":"the character did hold my interest therefore i did finish the book in three days noa p singleton troubles started long before january 1 2003 as she stated i didn't see the message the author is trying to suggest as far as parenting as far as her childhood secret goes was both parents the reason for noa's behavior or maybe it wasn't one all in all i did like the book for the twist i had several endings in mind and none of them happen","942":"this book is very well written the narrator is excellent storyline extremely interesting i was a bit mesmerized listening to this book on long car drive i did not give it a 5 star simply because it left me wondering ' what the hell just happened here' which is also part of it's charm","943":"4 stars for the general writing and sucking me into the story 2 stars for leaving touch with reality both from a medical and psychological point of view","944":"not a lot i can say about this one w o spoiling something if i could give it 3 5 stars i would though the writing felt at times a bit verbose a la atonement it was a fast read and definitely different it kept my attention but when i was done i felt a little confused and still had questions looking forward to discussing w someone else who reads it","945":"excellent but also a bit disturbing story very well written not the ending the reader hopes for but great insight into human naturea very good read","946":"overall this book was good kind of depressing but the characters and their motives were fascinating i liked the main character but i wanted to smack her at the same time it got a bit boring in a few places but the ending was really good","947":"noa is on death row this narrative explains in flashback her journey while i yearned for more fleshed out detail about the surrounding characters i found the novel quite enjoyable","948":"i was so bored with this book","949":"4 5 stars for me i adore unreliable first person narrators and the way silver allows noa to slowly unspool her tangled story is fabulous there are several dramatic plot twists in the novel and yet they felt so natural so uncontrived so true to this character noa marlene and noa's father are characters who behave in unsympathetic ways but i felt enormous sympathy for them well mostly for noa and her dad there's not a single character here who does what's right or who is faultless and that rings very true to me while i wished over and over that noa would just tell the truth she is so ensnared in the web she has walked into mostly on her own volition that she can't see a way out doesn't even seem to want a way out and yet even now i'm questioning whether if i have just been completely manipulated by her i suppose some readers might be critical of the way marlene is portrayed as a rather cold calculating manipulative woman with no moral compunction to do what is right but since this is noa's story narrated by noa it makes absolute and complete sense to me for her to come across this way this book is a page turner and its intensity builds as we move toward x day and the hoped for revelation of what really happened most of my criticisms i'm realizing are things i wish happened differently like i really wish noa's dad made an appearance in the present but i can also see the reasons why silver wouldn't allow the character to give us that kind of easy closure but has instead created a realistic portrayal of flawed characters that allows us to question all the ways in which guilt overlaps","950":"great premise but a horrible execution pun very much intended","951":"5 of 5 starsfrom the first paragraph of the execution of noa p singleton i became entrenched the story of death row inmate noa who tells the story of the six months leading to her scheduled execution her voice is sarcastic at times detached and occasionally humorous she's visited by two attorneys the young eager oliver and marlene who happens to be the mother of sarah the woman noa murdered apparently now marlene opposes the death penalty and she promises to advocate for clemency to the governor if noa will tell her the reasons for the murder additionally marlene has started an organization called mothers against death mad reference to mothers against drunk driving madd to advocate for prisoners on death row marlene writes letters to sarah which are both touching and revealing this is a well written often lyrical novel i found myself rooting for noa even while i wanted to shake her i didn't want the story to end and immediately after finishing i started to reread to see what i may have missed the first time","952":"really wanted to like this book but i was so irritated with the actions of a certain character","953":"outside of my usual genre interesting story line","954":"interesting ending not what i expected","955":"i had a hard time rating this one i enjoyed the book for the most part but i never felt attached to the book it took me over a month to finish and while i enjoyed the big reveal i didn't really love the ending","956":"a novel that strives too hard to be the new thing the execution of noa p singleton while having an engrossing plot line fails to live up to its potential the author is of the writing school wherein you use 5 words when one would suffice the literary pretension of using different fonts to show differing viewpoints grows wearisome i did finish the book but the ending offered no great revelations nor a sense of satisfaction nancy","957":"the first half of the book was interesting and engaging at about the halfway point it got even better and i could not stop reading to find out what was going on","958":"starting this book i had high expectations the synopsis was good the premise was wide open and i was ready for the best the first quarter of the book was left to details of noa's life prior trial and prison i did feel that this may have lasted a bit longer than was necessary ~~ background is good but after a while you just want to move on with the story and get to the meat of the book with that said i do believe that this is silver's first novel and all in all this was a minor flaw in an overall good book the next half of the book dealt with noa's crime and her imprisonment this was never in question ~~ she was guilty ~~ and calmly awaiting her execution date however in the last quarter of the book was when the plot thickened this is the portion of the story that took me from 3 stars to 4 stars for a new author i felt that the cause and effect elements and the number of surprises in this last portion were excellent things were not as they had appered and twists just kept coming well worth the slow beginning to see it appear much differently as the story ends this is an author that i will definately read again","959":"3 5 starsi have mixed feelings here while i thought the story was interesting and different the characters were all a pain in the ass i did not like one of them not one was normal or endearing or empathetic and i am not suggesting that a book must have a likeable character but it should give me one that i have a feeling besides derision for you can tell noa is one smart cookie but she cannot possibly speak in the convoluted nature that she speaks in prison the others would have no idea what she is talking about her prison relationships are not addressed here only because she probably does not have any besides patsmith...i don't know - i feel like i am being too harsh here i finished this rather quickly because it is a fast and good read but i am not going to run out and tell anyone they have to read this also wtf was in the box at the end really ugh","960":"incomplete and realistically so the uncertainties and unspoken reasons lent this novel the frustration we collectively feel in terms of crime and punishment and humanity daunting and serious well worth your time","961":"agree with the review that said the book should have been better than it is","962":"rating 3 5 starsno spoilers and therefore a somewhat vague review i think this is going to be quite popular when it comes out this summer it was compelling enough that i read it in three days noa is a convincing narrator with an unusual life story to tell her voice is gritty and sarcastic and resigned just as you'd expect from someone incarcerated for ten years and awaiting execution for capital murder although i'm not sure i liked noa herself i did like her narration noa killed sarah dixon ten years ago and all of her appeals have been used up now she's just counting down the months until the state of pennsylvania takes her life her only visitors are oliver stansted and marlene dixon sarah's mother marlene claims that all she wants from noa is to know why she killed sarah but marlene's a slimy operator and her true motivations are never made clear it seems she wants to revel in noa's suffering oliver is a young idealistic lawyer from england who sincerely wants to save noa's life it is for oliver that noa begins her narrative alternating her life history with the events taking place in the present my favorite rating is 3 5 stars which means i always have to agonize over rounding up or rounding down my primary reason for rounding down is that there was a feeling of incompleteness when i finished the book there's too much we don't get to find out about the characters so their motivations and behaviors don't quite make sense the only person we really get to know is noa p singleton and even her behaviors don't always seem to fit what we know about her i appreciate the brevity of the novel but i think it might have benefited from a bit more depth i do realize that's tough to pull off without an omniscient narrator one glaring error i hope will be corrected in the final version noa tells of a medical emergency she had in her college library she says it took place in the n section then goes on to list all the subjects beginning with n nefertiti napoleon north korea etc psssssst nonfiction books are not shelved alphabetically","963":" noa p singleton sits on death row just six months from her execution date she has made peace with her death date she confessed to the murder she was imprisoned for and she is ready to die she contemplates her last words her last meal then marlene dixon comes to visit marlene is not only a high power attorney but also the mother of the woman noa says she murdered marlene's testimony was partly what earned noa her death sentence but now marlene says she has changed her mind about the death penalty she no longer believes anyone should have the right to send another to death even for heinous crimes marlene wants to know the story of what happened on her daughter's last day alive and noa is the only one who can tell her marlene says she will do everything she can to get noa's sentence commuted to life in prison if she will tell the true story of what happened when her daughter was murdered noa isn't convinced marlene is sincere and doesn't want her sentence to be commuted she is ready to die for her crime as noa's story unfolds we are left wondering if she really committed the crime she says she confessed to committing this novel reminds me of a gillian flynn novel twists and turns psychologically thrilling characters you want to like but can't even the style of writing is similar and since gillian flynn is one of my favorites that is a compliment to elizabeth silver a great story that made me think about family bonds and reasons a person would murder another and whether or not the death penalty is always the way to go","964":" i received my copy of this novel through a goodreads firstreads givaway i began reading this novel and struggled so much that eventually i accepted that i wasn't going to finish it although i very much enjoyed the beginning of the plot and the idea behind it i was struggling i've been trying to put my finger onto exactly what was making the book such a hard read for me and i have found it to be a combination of two things these being the excessive use of long descriptive words that i have never heard used in a conversation before and the fact that when i find time to read i am generally rather tired since the novel is written in first person i an unsure whether the use of language is the authors personal style or a personality trait of the main character noa herself either way it sadly wasn't a book for me","965":"meryl streep as marlene dixon in the movie","966":"i would give this book 2 5 stars the writing was good and kept me interested i can't quite put my finger on it but i kept waiting for something big to happen that never did it was a perfectly fine story just not quite what i expected","967":"i enjoyed this one the story of a woman on death row and the victim's mother who is actually working to delay the execution as the story goes on the layers of the relationship of everyone involved becomes more tangled","968":"hadn't heard of this one but checked it out from my library i love being surprised by a good story even though the ending may not be as happy as you'd expect tight storytelling interesting characters and enough twists and turns to keep you reading","969":"i gave this three stars because of the premise i generally hated the characters and thought they were almost over created for their roles it was like the author was trying too hard to develop characters to fit her plot i disliked the remaining character at the end i pretty much disliked this book but i had to finish it because of the plot that's it","970":"1 16i refuse to finish this book i simply do not care what happens to the main character i don't like her and so i don't care to know what happens in her life i don't usually stop reading books that i start especially those which i am more than half way through but i just to care to finish this book i gave it a very solid try and i give up i hate the writing for such a simplistic story line the writing is just too dense and i don't enjoy it it's not that i don't like complex writing i do it's jut that this story line does not warrant this type of writing","971":"for the most part i enjoyed the book but the ending left me feeling rather meh what was the point of the whole exercise","972":" this was a novel that i truly enjoyed clever plot great pacing convincing self destructive characters but i had some reservations about the writing so i'd choose 3 1 2 stars to rate or 4 stars for structure 3 stars for the glut of metaphors and similes that drag it down clever metaphors yes but not essential to the story for the first half of the book as noa sitting on death row launches into the sad story of her derailed life i sensed that the author was doing that meticulous descriptive thing they must teach in creative writing programs hovering over an idea and squeezing as many metaphors from it as can be derived in a sitting amazingly just after a life threatening clog of them in chapter 8 my hands were cuffed facing each other like confused children outside the principal's office later my eyes pickpocketed the room the air cleared and the story sailed off at a satisfying clip this reader felt relieved i hope the author felt that way too as her story unfolded without all of that high strung hovering and her wonderful story telling voice was liberated from then on the pace was just right and enough information fed out just to keep the reader on edge and hungry for more noa's guilt is never in question but the degree of her guilt is does she deserve the death penalty why is she so passive these questions accumulate as the story moves along and you're never really sure of anything until x day passes","973":"if i simply can't put a book down then i know it's really really good this novel was excellent i did not put it down at all this first person narrative for the most part is from a woman on death row noa p singleton she's just received her date of execution when a new lawyer shows up wanting to file for clemency the individual who is co sponsoring driving this effort is the mother of the murder victim that may not seem so strange but as the story unfolds the history of noa's life things become more complex than you might imagine noa is a fascinating character and i wanted to try to get closer and closer to understanding what happened noa doesn't claim innocence but maybe she is what really happened why does the victim's mother have a changed perspective now and how will it end really it's a fantastic story and i highly recommend","974":"interesting read a little different writing style","975":"i enjoyed listening to this story i loved all of the references to philadelphia where most of the story takes place the main character noa is compelling and convincing the plot weaves together to let out small bits of information that kept me interested and curious i wished for a different ending that's why it only got 4 stars","976":"enjoyed reading the book i was hoping expecting more of a plot twist at the end","977":"the main character noa is not particularly likeable nor is any other character in the book i kept waiting to have that moment where you identify with at least one of the players in the book and sadly that never happened i began reading the book with great anticipation and slowly came to realize the summary of the book was far better than the whole thing it is a fast read with a few twists but not something i would recommend to others","978":"total page turner probably a 3 5 but the writing is terrific","979":" convicted of a murder at age 25 after refusing to participate in her own defense noa p singleton is visited a few months before her execution date by the mother of her victim marlene dixon you might think the resulting novel the execution of noa p singleton elizabeth silver's debut is a meditation on what drives us to crime or a look at the bonds we unwittingly form with people in our lives or a study on what guilt is while it is all of those things it is more importantly a skillfully written superbly plotted quiet page turner that builds chapter by chapter until you the reader are as entwined in the inbetween as noa and marlene set aside time you will want to read straight through reviewed by stephanie chase seattle public library","980":"this book got better in the middle basically noa is a complicated character and not at all likeable none of the characters are likeable in my opinion it was well written but i just wanted to finish reading it","981":"the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver is a real page turner noa p singleton is on death row for murdering a girl she is visited by marlene dixon the mother of the girl who noa is convicted of killing she is haunted by her daughter's death and wants noa to tell her the story of the night the murder happened in exchange for getting her off death row will noa tell the mother about what happened or not does noa get put to death or will the mother get her off there are lots of questions and to find the answers you will have to read the book for a first novel the writing is outstanding it's a very good book gerard's review","982":"really a 2 5 for me i liked the idea of this book and i thought the premise was clever but it moved too slow for me by the time noa finally gets through explaining the back story to why she is on death row it had just gone on and on and each little piece was revealed so far away from another little piece that i found myself not really caring what had happened after all i also didn't have one character that i found likeable or real and that always hampers my ability to like a book noa was interesting but too acerbic for my tastes i'm sure being on death row would make you that way and she didn't have the easiest of childhoods but i never really got her i especially didn't like her father or marlene or sarah and oliver should have been helpful but ended up just fading out of the book all in all the writing was good but it just missed the mark for me","983":"i had high hopes for the novel but it just took way to long to get to the point of anything the narrator is in prison for murdering her friend and she reminiscences on what got her to this point in her life good premise but lots of side stories with to me frustrating extraneous detail the wiping of a bar table for example gets an entire paragraph or more the narrator's tone also was off putting to me it could be just a personal take after starting this one i acquired another book i was very much looking forward to reading so i may have been impatient","984":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here 2 2 5 3 i don't know i went back and forth so much that i confused myself more than the overwritten prose did it kept me reading to the end which is something positive but then i was kind

was trying so hard to be elevated and smart that it made me feel idiotic and annoyed the english ma 2 2 5 3 i don't know i went back and forth so much that i confused myself more than the overwritten

that was that a lot of the metaphorical prose most of the words in the book actually was trying so hard to be elevated and smart that it made me feel idiotic and annoyed the english major in me cried tears of disappointment and frustration that i hadn't faced since the last shakespeare play i tried to comprehend semi unreliable narrator none of the characters were particularly likeable and i felt that marlene dixon in particular had really no purpose other than to run the story around in circles many times i found myself thinking just get to the damn point everytime marlene or noa spoke and don't get me started on how frustrating it was to see noa not fight for her life until you realize oh wait she actually didn't really deserve to be exonerated it feels like there was really no point to this story so why the hell write it other than to show off some flowery writing huh i guess that answers the question of how many stars i should give this more","985":" noa p singleton is an inmate on death row 6 months away from her execution she was convicted of killing a young girl named sarah but never explained what happened on the day of the shooting even as a defense at her trial suddenly sarah's mother marlene shows up claiming to no longer believe in the death penalty and saying she wants to help noa get her sentence commuted as long as she will set the record straight on what happened the story moves in flashbacks to how noa sarah and marlene are connected and to finally reveal what happened on that fateful day the book was ok it kept me engaged enough mostly just to find out what did actually happen but for the most part it wasn't a very well written book i didn't find the characters believable and most of the time their actions didn't really make any sense there are definitely better suspense novels out there","986":"7 apr 2014 a good beginning 3 stars a good read","987":"this is a well crafted mystery in the vein of gone girl the dinner and the other typist","988":" noa p singleton has resided on death row in pennsylvania for ten years and is within six months of being executed for the crime of murdering a young pregnant woman in elizabeth l silver's thought provoking debut novel the execution of noa p singleton marlene the mother of noa's victim sarah argued persuasively and successfully for the death penalty but now ten years later she has changed her mind she now believes that no one has the right to take a life and that includes the state in retribution for murder noa is rightfully suspect of this change of heart and as the story unwinds in noa's voice and letters marlene has written to her dead daughter we can see why it is difficult to review this intriguing story without giving too much away but here goes noa is what is known as an unreliable narrator we cannot trust that what she has said is the truth this novel tries to untangle noa's story beginning with life with a sometimes actress mother who lived with a lot of men as noa grew up did any of them molest noa and if so did that effect her later behavior her father left noa and her mother and she had no contact with him until she went to college and found that he owned a bar in the city where she went to school noa left college after an incident in the college library that left her physically and emotionally scarred she is reluctant to become involved with her father an ex con with a lot of problems he wants to become a part of noa's life but she is leery of him still she spends more and more time with him one day noa runs into the bar and tells her father a man was following her her father chases after the man and catches him that sets in motion a chain of events that leads to noa being convicted of sarah's murder the trial scenes that silver writes are fascinating from the 12 hour police interview to the juror selection after just having served jury duty i found this part really interesting to the actual trial conviction and sentencing silver is a lawyer and worked on several death penalty cases and her expertise shines through here silver writes noa's incarceration scenes with empathy and integrity the reader is dropped into a world not many of us know thank goodness and noa's sense of isolation is palpable noa comes to believe that she belongs there saying it's the internal acceptance that finally you have become the person you were meant to be when you enter true you are given a new number a new residence and a new wardrobe but is is only when you place those garments upon your limbs that realize they were meant for no one but you no former splinters of your personality carry over into prison life no relationships fictional or otherwise accompany them either any superficial intimacy you claim to have experienced with another whether consanguineous or not when you wore any color other than cocoa brown fades as quickly as a puff of smoke you are now the person everyone knows you to be reading this deeply affecting novel will have you questioning the use and human cost of capital punishment silver sprinkles in some jaw dropping revelations from secret relationships to incidents in the noa's past that are stunning and also explain much of noa's willingness to accept her fate the suspense here is so well done the execution of noa p singleton put me in mind of another novel i read with an unreliable female character marcy dermanksy's bad marie they have the same dark tone and unforgettable protagonists if you like a story that will make you think and question human nature this is the novel for you i'm still thinking about it days after i have finished it silver's debut novel has me looking for more from her in the future","989":"i wasn't particularly thrilled by this story it wasn't necessarily bad but it was just very underwhelming and not memorable at all not likely to be a book i'll share with others","990":"the narrative style keeps you interested","991":"i'm really serious about how writers should hire me as a checker of philadelphia facts it's girard ave not st and you couldn't go to a liquor store by penn's landing or a gun shop on the schuylkill because we don't have any businesses on our waterfronts duh","992":"slow to start some what anticlimactic and predictable end","993":" unreliable narrators make for good stories noa p singleton is a classic unreliable narrator and the pace at which she opens up to the reader is skillfully controlled until the very end noa sits on death row convicted of a crime that she never denies committing she talks directly to the reader this is supposed go be her prison memoir in a snarky affected manner this voice conveying the feeling that even now she is throwing up walls noa is not really sympathetic but it's not clear whether this was the author's intention even though the book is a halting revelation of her motives by the end most readers will probably not feel that those motives fit the crime i found noa to be strangely underdeveloped and the other characters even more so this was probably why i couldn't empathize with her though this book definitely pulls you in and keeps you reading it doesn't leave you satiated in that i just finished a good book kind of way the tone and narration of this story remind me a lot of gone girl but that book had better characters and is easier to recommend","994":"it was ok i liked it what would that be 2 1 2 stars unfortunately i can't really go into detail without giving certain plot points away let's just say some of it seemed pretty implausible most of the characters were unlikeable and the writing was overly clever at times but i read it all the way through because straining credibility as it did i still wanted to know what happened so since i cannot award 2 1 2 stars i will give it 3","995":" a friend whose book suggestions are usually ones i enjoy gave this book a rave said she was hooked from the beginning and couldn't put it down my opinion is the total opposite i didn't like noa main character couldn't get myself to care she was in prison and liked the two other main characters less the writing was over done i felt like i was moving through molasses half way through i started skipping because i just wanted it done after i finished i read amazon reviews and found people really liked it or really didn't like it i clearly didn't like it","996":"couldn't put it down very heartfelt story","997":"i read this as an audio book and don't know if the reader for the audio influenced my decision but the main character wad hard to like and hard to care about","998":"this was interesting","999":"i picked this up at the beach this summer and was halfway through when the book had to be returned to the library i enjoyed it enough that i checked it out to resume although this meant starting over since the structure of the narration is nonlinear and i couldn't be sure whether i had forgotten a plot point or whether it had not yet been discussed i enjoyed this one more than its reviews suggested that i should","1000":"intriguing characters and a story that leaves you wondering what would you do in their position i like that the book left me wondering what was it all for and why a wonderful book that does not wrap everything up in a neat little bow but instead keeps you thinking about it the characters their actions u0026amp why for days after","1001":"i tried i struggled i finished but with little satisfaction as i read i kept calling to mind to other books i have read this year this book had glimmers of possibility i kept hoping is would become another gone girl it never materialized i also thought of burial rites there was some compassion in that book this book was terrible disappointment","1002":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here interesting premise kinda boring book wearing that bracelet every day the mom needs to be in a psych ward 'nuff said not worth the time to read it pretty disappointed","1003":"very good read","1004":"yet another book that i just couldn't get into to save my life i'm a fan of the book tv series orange is the new black so i liked how the book started out with noa in prison but it went downhill from there","1005":"i was four stars on this until the full story was explained i felt that plot point was a bit of a letdown i guess i was expecting much more that said i'd read another book by this author","1006":"didn't really care for the main character or any of the characters really and struggled to finish the book","1007":"interesting story filled with despicable characters the least of which is noa p singleton","1008":"i couldn't get into the character of noa her sass grated on my nerves and the story wasn't compelling to me but the writing was clear and enjoyable i would read other works form this author again","1009":"elizabeth l silver is a talented writer this is a novel about noa p singleton who looksback on her life from her cell on death row strange as it seems to read a book aboutsomeone facing the death penalty the author does an amazing job of not onlyterrific writing but a sensational story is she guilty is noa p singleton guilty of murder or merely a person in the wrong place","1010":"good twist to the story unsatisfying ending","1011":"great idea but executed zing poorly the wordy mixed nonsensical and often just plain incorrect metaphors were really distracting didn't anyone edit this book i'm also not sure what the point was supposed to be i felt like the book just ended i actually had to check my digital copy to make sure i didn't accidentally skip several chapters i'm glad i read a library version and didn't pay for this","1012":" i would venture to say most felons in prison proclaim to be innocent and sadly enough some people who are convicted are not guilty of the crime unfortunately i became a victim of crime so i know something about our justice system that sometimes fails victims criminals aren't always brought to justice and made to pay for their crimes and innocent people that happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time don't get the fair and reasonable justice they deserve the main character in this novel is sitting on death row at the prison in muncy pennsylvania with only six months remaining before the death sentence is carried out out of the blue two lawyers who work for a non profit organization that represents inmates on death row visit noa p singleton marlene dixon is a high powered philadelphia attorney and also the mother of the woman for whom noa was convicted of killing marlene wants to convince the governor to commute noa's death sentence to life in prison all marlene wants from noa is the story on how and why her daughter sarah was killed oliver stansted tells noa \"i've recently had the pleasure of meeting mrs marlene dixon and she believes you should live \"noa remarks to oliver \"you think i'm wrongly convicted don't you you want to start your career off with a bowl of karma \"he answered \"innocence is always a factor to discuss especially when dealing with executions \"noa replies \"the truth is at one point i did contemplate my innocence but it was short lived like adolescent lust or a craving for chocolate \"oliver stansted was not the first advocate noa had seen that wanted to climb up the ladder of success but he could be the last will noa trade her story for a life sentence or has she come to terms with her impending death i especially liked that this novel was written in the first person narrative point of view i am fairly sure you will be at the least surprised at the ending jeannie walker award winning author","1013":"more than i wanted to know about death row i liked the puzzle but was missing a few of what could have been juicier pieces recommended as similar to gone girl not nearly as good a read","1014":"this was a very interesting book told from two points of view the killer and the victim' s mother nothing is as it seems as you progress further and further into the story there really isn't a likable character but you don't actually dislike them either you can almost understand what happens but wait is that what really happened this could be a good recommendation for book clubs but might be too deep and convoluted for a good summer read","1015":"check out the full review at kritters ramblingsa morbid central plot but presented in an interesting way with the person on death row telling the story popping in to the past and back to the present to catch the reader up on all the important details noa p singleton is awaiting her execution day and it has been set but out of the blue comes the mother of her victim claiming to help her get clemency and this is where the real story begins","1016":"interesting story it felt like the author was setting the reader up for a big twist and although there was definitely some twisting it went in a completely different direction than i had anticipated in the end i just wanted something more else","1017":"noa p singleton has reached the end of her appeals and will soon be executed when an attorney shows up offering to seek clemency on her behalf the novel reveals noa's trial life and the events leading up to the murder for which she's been convicted and sentenced to die the book's premise is promising but the execution is lacking with overwrought and ambiguous language dragging the story down 2 5 out of 5","1018":"noa is on death row when the mother of the woman she killed offers a chance at clemency if noa will reveal why she killed sarah but did she kill sarah this book took a number of twists and turns and was a fascinating look at human behavior motivations how people are punished and how they punish themselves","1019":"i think this is more of a 3 5 but i couldn't round it up to a 4 i think it was a good premise but didn't quite playout as i would have expected it to","1020":"i was not fond of this book at all it was not a page turner for me it took me 3 times as long to read as other books of a similar length i did not trust believe or like the narrator i am not one to say that characters have to be likable for a book to be enjoyable but not a single character in this book had one redeemable characteristic i loved gone girl and this is no gone girl","1021":"noa is a prickly inmate of death row who is trying not to help the last lawyer in a long line of lawyers who are trying to appeal her sentence there are a lot of floundering metaphors and the writing needs some tightening up but overall i enjoyed the story and found the ending touching","1022":"i really enjoyed the way this book is written but it just seemed rushed or incomplete","1023":"a quick easy read the protagonist is a bit of an unreliable narrator adding to the mystery of what really went down i liked this book because it kept me guessing till the end","1024":"i have never thought of what it must be like knowing the exact day that you are going to die not only is the main character on death row and has been for quite some time but her victim's mother is now trying to get her off of it the execution of noa p singleton by elizabeth l silver is a phenomenal book that reveals how important a parent's influence and example to her child is and how much that can affect them and the decisions they make when they grow up i thought that this book did an amazing job of really catching the reader's eye almost immediately noa's story is so complicated and so many things lead up to the day that she kills hers victim it is hard to put down the book once you start because all you want to know is more and more about what was going through her head and what happens next noa is on death row for killing a girl named sarah sarah's mother a lawyer and another lawyer that works at her firm are working to try and get noa off of death row this dives into an incredible story where the real truth comes out after a very long time and the true colors of people are shown for everyone to see noa did not have the typical upbringing of a normal girl her father was out of the picture and her mother had a many new boyfriends in shorts amount of time her mother did not lead the best example for her and you really see how that starts to effect noa as she grows up she makes bad decisions that could easily have been avoided if she had just told the truth noa does not realize the consequences of her actions until it is too late and is punished noa knew no better her role model growing up was her mother who made the same exact decisions and taught her daughter that it was okay to do so in this book the reader really sees how much a parent role model's influence can change their child's life in a second overall this book is an amazing story that will constantly keep you on your toes and it is great for anyone who loves lots of twists and surprises i enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone if they like a good mystery","1025":"just couldn't get through it returned it to the library halfway read today someone else might like it but despite its interesting premise it's just so danged strung out","1026":"i gave it 100 pages and quit the story started out solid but the plot became unrealistic and the tone throughout was depressing i couldn't stand any of the characters","1027":" good basic premise with flawed execution ultimately i found this book to be subpar if you want to find a book that depicts a protagonist as a misunderstood victim of a jury's societal prejudices then read camus's the stranger in comparison this book just seems like a cheap knock off noa p as the narrator of this book tries to justify her actions through cliche mother issues father issues she shot her childhood friend and used the same intruder excuse that her mother used to get out of murder it's all a bit too much at least camus's meursault is somewhat relatable and his antagonists are menacing arabs here i have no sympathy for noa p and cannot begin to relate to her motives her actions are wrong without a tinge of write that's were the book goes wrong without a anti heroine with which one can identify all interest is lost and the reader can not help but meet the ending with cries of hate","1028":"the story itself was decent but lots of weird similes and strange writing made the story drag out and hard to understand at times lots of big words i'm not even sure the author herself understood it took me awhile to get through this book it starts out rather slow i didn't find it to be a page turner but i did finally finish it and it was just ok","1029":"when i read the reviews in all the many book publication magazines i get i thought it was going to be great and couldn't wait until i could get an inexpensive copy so when i got a chance to get it free from the library for my mp3 i jumped at the chance thinking that if it was as good as it sounded like it would be it may be one for my book club after i was part way through listening to it the book itself became available at the library so i got it so i could skim the book also in case i missed something while listening to it i will say this for it it was one of the few books i've listened to that really kept my attention normally i tend to lose my concentration off and on since i'm walking as i read i still skimmed the book to be sure however it really wasn't worth as much time as i gave it the reader on the audio was very good i enjoyed her a lot and this novel is one that is better as an audio if i was reading it i probably would have grown tired of it the author writes very well in places but only in places the story itself is put together rather confusedly and the characters are all rather strange and not particularly believable or likable it is being called a mystery and a thriller there really is no thrill and since the title is the execution of noa p singleton there is very little mystery perhaps that's why she put the novel together the way she did so that the reader would be confused hence it could be called a mystery i went back and forth as i listened from thinking it was a really good story and it was really going to go somewhere to thinking well it's ok to then thinking it wasn't very good to thinking how much i wanted to like it but it was letting me down the previous sentence pretty much describes the novel obviously i'm not going to recommend it but because i finished it and it did keep me entertained will give it 3 stars","1030":"over written and under plotted","1031":" considering that this debut novel has been compared to gone girl and the dinner two books that i thoroughly enjoyed i had high expectations for the execution of noa p singleton the premise of the story is promising - noa a young woman who has been on pennsylvania's death row for a decade is just months away from the so called x or execution day when she receives a surprise visit from marlene dixon the mother of the woman sarah that noa was convicted of murdering although marlene a high powered partner in an international law firm had spoken passionately at the penalty phase of noa's trial she now claims to have reservations about the death penalty and has offered to use her resources to seek clemency for noa as the novel proceeds we learn that the acerbic sarcastic and sullen noa was a gifted student who had scored exceptionally well on her sats and had been accepted to princeton but studied premed at penn until her education was unexpectedly derailed yet noa's jaded affect was not honed in prison rather she is the daughter of a failed community theater actress with a string of doomed love affairs and a ex con father caleb who attempts a reconciliation after a 25 year old absence as caleb tries to right the past with noa noa learns that he is dating sarah who is pregnant with his child the prosecution claims that noa killed sarah and her unborn child in a jealous rage and noa who refuses to assist in her own defense is convicted although there are a number of surprise twists that kept me turning the pages the twists were so implausible e g why didn't noa reveal marlene's involvement in the events that culminated in sarah's death that i was left dissatisfied","1032":"noa has been on death row for ten years after having been convicted of murdering sarah six months before her execution is to take place sarah's mother marlene dixon an attorney visits noa under the guise of trying to change her sentence to life imprisonment as noa relates about the visits she reveals tidbits of her struggles to make a decent life before her murder conviction the reader also learns that noa did not speak up for herself at any point in the trial eventually marlene dixon's true intentions are revealed as the day for noa's execution nears after finishing the book i vacillate between enjoying how silver told the story from noa's viewpoint only and wishing for something else in the writing to help promote the plot and character development","1033":"a beautifully written book which is both gripping and haunting at the same time it deals with the subject of the death penalty and will leave you thinking after you have finished it","1034":"i was intrigued by the title as well as the blurb on this one it's an interesting premise and i liked the back forth presentation of the story from different time periods what i didn't like was the dense unnecessary prose one reviewer called it pretentious prose constant strange and mixed similes and metaphors it's a good mystery but there are far too many pieces left hanging and while i wanted to empathize with noa there really is no one in the book to champion","1035":"wow excellent excellent suspenseful thriller about capital punishment that certainly keeps you guessing until the very last page extremely hard to put down causing some marital friction when i wanted to read through lunch dinner and several evenings","1036":"i loved her writing great use of metaphor a story that slowly revealed more depth and characters that were flawed and real i would give 4 stars except i thought the plot lagged just a little mid book a solid read for those who like psychological drama","1037":"an inmate on death row slowly reveals the events that got her there in this psychological novel a mostly compelling book but i began to lose interest as the end approached and didn't feel there was enough of a payoff","1038":"i really do not write reviews but for this book i had to it was torture to get through and i finally gave up after reading goodreads and saw that people felt the same as me slow moving story and nothing happens","1039":" this book started off strong and the plot was there however it just didn't do it for me when i read a book i want to escape reality and fall into the author's world i wasn't able to do this all the time with this book maybe it's due to the dystopia genre i've fallen in love with that genre is my new high for now i loved the intelligent banter wit and mat gre vocabulary found throughout this novel the unexpected twist as to why her friend persephone never showed to her trial to speak on her behalf was anything but banal the initial reasoning for adopting her middle name was uncanny the mother of the murdered victim makes noa look like an angel yet i still believe this novel was ok maybe i just missed it maybe i should have read this another time i stick to my rating this book was ok","1040":" 3 5 stars this much like cartwheel is about a young woman tangled up in a mess i think i enjoyed this book more than cartwheel overall because it didn't try so hard but at the same time the writing was very much that of a first book noa had one heck of a life and this book gets interesting after about the half way point but i'll allow that a good tangled web needs time to tighten and release each character in this has their own motivations that make it interesting though oliver was not fully fleshed out for me nor were noa's parents it's kind of there but more was important to the tale if you need a quick read and can let a few things slide for an overall interesting skeleton tale it's worth a quick red","1041":"a very intriguing book which really makes you think about the death penalty in america","1042":"weird strange eerie tale of a convicted murderer on death row compelling yes","1043":"its hard to say i really liked a book with no likable characters this book is well written engrossing and surprising i'm recommending it to my friends so i have someone to talk to about it","1044":"affirmed that i am not a proponent of the death penalty but kind of a snooze surprise ending was weak","1045":" in the end despite finding the book interesting in some ways i really disliked it i found it so hard to care about most of the characters and the ending was a real turn off i think the real problem is that no one in the book except perhaps noa is remotely sympathetic one character had promise but fizzled and so did the book in the end because everyone seems very damaged but the reasons for the damage are either unexplained or simplistic the resolution also seems simplistic and inexplicable","1046":"really i'm going to say 3 5 stars it was a decent book i liked the beginning and the middle but i wasn't satisfied with the ending there were some little twists in the middle though that i wasn't expecting","1047":"an interesting look at the death penalty although lesson before dying will always be the best look at the death penalty this book had good character development and some plot twists that i didn't expect","1048":"this was pretty bad not horrible but definitely bad silver overwrites there are all kinds of lengthy sentences and convoluted metaphors that's forgivable at least in my estimation but what is not forgivable particularly in what is essentially a mystery is that the book is just not believable the choices these people make the links between past and present the motivations the guilt that supposedly undergirds the whole thing all of it implausible and if you want to string me along for 300 pages and this is basically what mysteries do sometimes wonderfully then i have to buy what you're selling at the very end and in this case that just wasn't possible the very reason that noa does not participate in her own defense and is on death row in the first place read the premise for the whole book her unwillingness to tell anything that happened leading up to or during the murder made very little sense to me and if that doesn't make sense the whole book is basically a pointless exercise the whole thing just felt really amateurish","1049":"i found the ending disappointing the book was never wrapped up people simply disappeared","1050":"wow lots of unexpected turns no chance of guessing the outcome of this book in addition i found surprisingly beautiful prose for this genre i will look for this author again","1051":"i really enjoyed this book while we know what happened more or less to lead noa to death row it's the telling of the stories that bring out the details you don't expect or do expect whether you guessed the bits would come together or not it was a compelling book i found myself sitting in dark rooms parked cars and standing in the backyard with the dog just so i could continue listening","1052":"this book was interesting but not great i found the main character to be rather unappealing but the writing was good enough to keep me reading there is a major twist about 2 3 of the way into the book that totally took me by surprise this would be a good airplane book since it could be read while waiting for and on one flight then leave the paperback at your destination to find another home","1053":"read half of the book no thank you gimmicky weak and too self conscious","1054":"i could not get into this story at first the characters are very cliche the wise cracking underdog woman who is smarter than everyone around her the ex con with the bog heart the high powe controlling mother i kept on with the story because plot twists were promised later on the twists did not deliver","1055":"the book just kinda run out of gas for me i guess i was expecting some bizarre twist at the end but i thought the ending was rather lame to be honest","1056":"hard to get into at the beginning because noa is not very likable but once i got into it i couldn't put it down the author's words and phrases are amazingly descriptive love her writing style","1057":" i maintain that this was really well written and i did enjoy reading it it was a good look at capital punishment and judgment in general and i think is probably a pretty accurate portrayal of what life is like when you're in prison and your execution date is approaching the characters were all completely unlikeable which is always fun i just was kind of disappointed with the ending spoilers i think it was definitely right that noa had to die being inside her head was fascinating finding out what actually happened was really interesting i just wish her story had been shown to anybody even just oliver or i wish marlene had read it i want that woman to know that she's the reason her daughter died i honestly couldn't believe that noa who seemed to be a pretty spiteful character didn't at least pull that out for marlene at the very end the oh likeable character oliver also let me down in the end why he was able to just give up a case he'd been obsessed with for a full decade just to save his career is a mystery to me what a disappointment anyway i liked this i just felt let down by the ending i always feel better when a self righteous character gets put in her place and i wish that had happened","1058":"i was ready to give this book 4 stars even though the writing was somewhat awkward because it was so compelling however when i got to the end i still didn't know what really happened but not in a good way as you sometimes find in a superior book","1059":"3 5 stars i think not really sure how i feel about this book it was a page turner and it was easy to read but i didn`t like any of the characters so was not rooting for anyone and felt disconnected from them all which is the complete opposite of how i want to feel when reading","1060":"disclaimer i received a free copy of this book on netgalley from the publisher in return for an honest review authorelizabeth l silver is a graduate of the university of pennsylvania the ma programme in creative writing at the university of east anglia in the uk and temple university beasley school of law she has worked as an esl instructor in costa rica editorial assistant at a publishing house in new york adjunct instructor of english composition and literature at several universities in philadelphia and an attorney in both texas and california reviewi requested this book on netgalley because i was intrigued by the synopsis imagine being sentenced to death and all of a sudden the mother of the person you presumably murdered makes an attempt to get you of death row that must be all kinds of weird but as you will see at the bottom i am not that enthusiastic about the book after reading it and it mostly has to do with emotions the story is solid while it develops you get answers to your questions you can guess and puzzle along for motives and situations that will happen until you get the whole puzzle elizabeth l silver did a great job in keeping the last piece of the puzzle till the last page but i despised noa and her attitude i experienced the story as dark and depressing and negative noa does not want to be rescued never she think she deserves all th bad she gets and even though that feeling gets explained it made me dread picking up the book i do not like depressed people who cannot see light at the end of the tunnel and even though getting touched in any way by a book this bad could be something good i just cannot get any positive feeling with this book but please if you do not mind self loathing protagonists do pick up this book because the puzzle is done so well","1061":" the basic facts are clear from the start noa is on death row for a murder she committed the book delves into the circumstances that brought her to this place and the life influences on her and on her victim i think it is probably a 3 5 star book but i am a very logical reader and movie goer what happens has to make sense so without spoiling the story for anyone i think caleb and marlene each make illogical decisions take illogical actions that move the story along but i question them would either really have done those things","1062":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is my first ever review and really more of a commentary and question forget the prose and whether you like noa not one review that i've read so far even mentions noa's background and her mother's story or persephone these are such enormous issues and to me are the reason for her sad life i wish my book club would read this book as i so want to discuss it in person","1063":"this book is quite readable but in the end not very satisfying sometimes thought provoking and interesting but not tight enough in characters or story to be above average","1064":"this book was very well written it was a little like watching an artist paint a painting from beginning to end i did have some problems with the story none of the characters were really likeable which left me not rooting for any of them it was also hard to be sympathetic the cruelty of each character was well portrayed i'm still not sure i know exactly who did what and where and when i wasn't sure when some of them were lying or telling the truth they honestly were all hard to believe this could have been a true story as i could see it really happening the ending left me scratching my head","1065":" i went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars i really enjoyed this book and i'd recommend it other reviewers noted that it's along the same lines as the other typist and gone girl and the dinner all books i read and enjoyed i felt the books were similar but i did not see noa as an unrealiable narrator so much as a reticent one she never denies so much as omits and we do find out the truth in the end my one major qualm was the pacing although i found the book to be a page turner i wished the revelations had been offered up a little bit more evenly rather than primarily at the end for me this gave the book a weird structure but overall i really did love this book and i'll be sharing it with wpl's rave reviews","1066":"kept me guessing until the very last page and i was constantly wondering about the sanity of all the mainncharacters until the last page i tend to think that is a good thing in a novel makes me think harder and contemplate the messages inherent to the story puzzling to the very end and even then you aren't totally sure what you have read and how it all really ended for the characters","1067":"audio great psychological thriller enjoyed learning about the life of noa p singleton and how she came to death row many twists in this","1068":" gone girl the other typist the silent wife the execution of noa p singleton introducing unlikeable protagonists who may not be reliable narrators seems to be a trend among authors launching debut novels in the execution of noa p singleton we meet a young woman who is sitting on death row awaiting execution for murder we quickly learn within the first three pages that she \"was lucid attentive mentally sound and pumped with a single cup of decaffeinated lemon zinger tea\" when she pulled the trigger but of course there is more to her story a story that is told during the six month period leading up to x day somewhat reconciled to her fate noa is surprised by the unexpected visit of two lawyers oliver stansted a young naive brit who passionately believes she was wrongfully sentenced to death and marlene dixon a high powered attorney who also happens to be the mother of sarah noa's victim a strong advocate of a new agency called mad mothers against death marlene has undergone a change of heart since testifying at noa's trial ten years previously she no longer believes in the death penalty and wants to help commute noa's sentence at first she appears to be taking the high ground but a different marlene emerges in the letters to her dead daughter which are interspersed throughout the novel noa's story slowly unfolds as a series of flashbacks we read about her mother a failed community theater actress who shamelessly neglected her daughter and the absentee father who showed up several months before the horrendous crime in fact his intrusion in noa's life sets in motion a series of events that ultimately lead to sarah's tragic death the theme of betrayal runs rampant throughout the novel noa's former friends and classmates turn on her describing her as a pathological liar with manipulative tendencies her mother's acting skills fail her as she shamelessly flirts with the prosecuting attorney while testifying on her daughter's behalf as for her father he didn't even testify after the trial everyone disperses leaving noa to face ten years of incarceration before \"x\" day author elizabeth silver has written a thought provoking novel about that \"gray middle ground\" between legal innocence and actual innocence","1069":"this book had disgusting characters but it was well written review here http booksandbowelmovements com 201","1070":"see more reviews on the best books ever have we ever talked on here about how much i love unreliable narrators because i do i think it's a fascinating twist on what you know or think you know about a story's plot when you find out that your narrator who is supposed to be guiding you through the story isn't giving you an accurate picture of events the execution of noa p singleton doesn't just have an unreliable narrator it's full of unreliable characters in general every last person in this story is hiding something or lying or just not telling the whole truth it makes for an interesting reading experience as you slowly start to dig past the half truths i had a hard time connecting with any of the characters because they all just make so many stupid decisions that set a tragic series of events into motion i wouldn't say that any of the characters in this book are likeable but they are fascinating or at least their motivations are noa is a murderer and an unrepentant one at that she never denies her crime and in fact has never bothered to defend herself or tell her side of the story marlene the mother of the woman who noa killed is overbearing and manipulative and demanding and while she says she doesn't want noa to be executed you can tell that her changed mind isn't entirely out of the goodness of her heart noa's mother was more interested in men and her career as an actress than in mothering her daughter her absentee father who reappears through the course of the story is a liar and a criminal and can't give a straight answer to save his life even oliver the attorney helping the uninterested noa with her case is hiding something i enjoyed reading noa's account of her life the story is told part in present day part in flashbacks as noa writes out her life's story for oliver she's still not interested in doing anything to save herself but it seems like she knows she has to tell her story to someone her background is convoluted and sad and you find yourself wondering a lot about nature vs nurture hands up social sciences people i know you're out there was noa destined to become what she is could she have been saved or was she always slated to become a murderer was she led into it because of her circumstances because of poor parenting because of poor decision making elizabeth silver's writing in this book is very interesting writing from noa's perspective she uses a lot of flowery language metaphors that don't always make sense repetition etc it made certain passages difficult to slog through as you try to unpack what all of the grandiose statements meant but it also seemed in tone with the kind of person noa is perhaps someone trying to hide behind her words using them as a shield to deflect from the truths about what she's done in her life this is silver's first novel i'd be interested to read future books from her to see if this is just her writing style or if it was a tone taken up by her to best suit noa one of my only bigger criticisms of this book is that i was left kind of cold and unsatisfied by the ending i felt like there were so many loose ends that didn't get tied up it's not a book that lends itself to a sequel so the author clearly wasn't saving the missing pieces until later the lack of concrete resolutions is appropriate this is a book about murder and imprisonment and guilt and in real life cases like these there often aren't concrete answers and hard truths to wrap everything up neatly but i wish i could have learned just a little bit more about the characters to fully understand them before the book ended","1071":"this is a book club book it is written for book clubs and their members to coo and caw over no doubt someone you know in a book club will rave about this book and tell you that it is brilliant it's got all the elements a room full of wine soaked soccer moms need to talk and feel self important about as they discuss their opinions but that doesn't make it a good book it also doesn't make it a bad book this book is better than average but not great by any stretch of the imagination it's a solid 3 star book and perhaps 3 5 it's written in the technically sound style you'd hope to find from an mfa author like silver is and it has the kind of attention to detail you'd expect from a lawyer there are two major points which really work to it's detriment the first is the poor pacing after beginning interesting this book drags from about the half way point on you know the first person narrator is unreliable and that she's withholding information and it gets aggravating waiting for it my other issue is that in the end nothing happens nothing changes the point of the story is supposed to be a lofty idealist one it's supposed to provoke discussion on topics like guilt remorse justice and more but a book needs more than talking points to be good the story itself needs to have a point a moral a theme and this book lacks one in the end the story of noa p singleton does nothing moves no one it has no impact on any of the other characters in the story as a result a reader can finish this book and wonder what the point of it all was and that is a glaring and egregious omission i've been hard on this book despite my willingness to give it 3 or possibly 3 5 stars that's because there is a lot of good in this book too there is a clue as to the big shocker moment in this book that is dropped early on it sticks out and makes you question the author's apparent poor choice at the time but it's not a big enough issue that it affects the reader's ability to get into the story as was my issue with gillian flynn's gone girl so when it all comes together later in the book you can't help but have respect for the author's pre planning another bright spot is the narrator herself noa p singleton is very likable despite admitting to shooting the person she's on death row for killing right off the bat you can't help but like her and root for her and want her to have good reasons for what she's done and what she's doing in the end it's good but not great it misses it's chance to be profound and it's ending makes you feel like you wasted just as much time reading noa's story as she did in writing it down it's worth reading but not worthy of the book club buzz","1072":"i really loved this book it's so different from what i usually read but i was so captivated by it that i ended up reading it in 3 days since i don't want to give away any spoilers this review is bound to be a bit vague let's just say this is not what you expect it to be it's way better","1073":" alright what do you think of the death penalty if you're american i have a feeling you might be opposed to it at least that was the impression i got when the walmart clerk started criticising singapore's death penalty at about 2am in the morning when we just arrived for me i don't know i don't have any objections but then again i don't know anyone who was sentenced to death what i see is the death penalty given to drug mules murderers and the like not exactly people that you can sympathise with easily but in the execution of noa p singleton you get a very clever book that slowly shifts your thinking around i started out the book thinking that noa was annoying but i ended the book sympathising with her or at least i found another character to despise even more noa is not immediately likable she comes across as cynical and rude and basically my opposite plus she admits to killing the victim and her child but as she tells her story i realised that inside she's a softy she's just cynical because of her childhood and as cliched as that sounded when i typed it out it was actually quite moving when i was reading the book plus i hate it when someone games the system it was so obvious as the book progressed that noa never stood a chance she was up against a person influential enough to make sure she dies and no this is not a happy ending book when all is revealed all in all i think this is a good book it's engaging and thought provoking there's quite a few f bombs so coupled with the dark subject matter i'd only recommend it for mature people disclaimer i got a free copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for a free and honest review this review was first posted at inside the mind of a bibliophile","1074":"the story of noa and the events that led her to wind up on death row and just months before her execution unfolds as the mother of the girl noa was convicted of shooting shows up asking for the whys behind it all we learn about noa's childhood the father she never knew the mother who was to busy with husband # x and the woman who hired noa to breakup her daughter's relationship noa never fought for herself when she was on trial she believes she deserves to be there but the reader has to unfold her stories to truly find out what makes noa feel this way to me this was an interesting story about death row and how individuals end up there are they destined to end up there from their childhood did our law force truly convict the right person did they even look at anyone else and if you've always been on the short end of the stick is it right to just give up and assume it's your lot in life was the writing a bit verbose sure did i want to strangle some of the characters at times absolutely was i hoping for a different ending of course i saw a little bit of myself in noa and that only made me want her to fight harder for herself instead of just sitting on death row for 10 years in addition to the who done it mystery i enjoyed how the book made me analyze my judgments and assumptions about those who are sentenced to an execution","1075":"interesting premise i was enthralled by the narrative voice","1076":" i was grabbed by the story of this novel a girl is on death row for a crime she may or may not have committed and a lawyer appears promising to get her off at the beginning you wont' even know what the crime was but as the book goes on more and more details will be revealed my huge issue with this book was the complete lack of emotions that the main character noa portrayed she is stiff cardboard and cold i'm not sure if this was done deliberately but there were literally no redeemable characters of any kind in this novel what compeled me to get through it was the mystery aspect and finding out what really happened","1077":" this was a brilliant book beautiful written with such descriptive language that's sure to paint a picture in your mind with every sentence that being said i certainly felt upset throughout the novel and was downright pissed off by the end of it not because the story wasn't adequate it certainly was and it gripped me but because what i wanted and what actually occurred were very different things of course such is life and the emotions this evoked speak to what a great novel it is unfortunately the real ending it had made it a great story even though i hated it if you're looking for a rapidly unfolding action packed story this isn't it there are no great mysteries or major 'aha ' moments but what it has is depth of insight into the levels of injustice selfishness and apathy that people feel when faced with tough choices sometimes doing the wrong thing is easier and people will choose the easier path even if this causes great pain to those around them this is an honest and heartbreaking account of the what can occur when the system is fails and the cost that those who are at its mercy have to pay i was very pro capital punishment prior to this but reading this book and the experiences of a character on death row i changed my mind quite a bit don't expect to feel anything but anger and disgust throughout it but i would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for some insight into the life of someone on death row fiction aside it paints an accurate image of the people behind it the monsters we dehumanize to the point of becoming just another statistic of the justice system one of my favorite quotes from the book puts a unique spin on trials making us question our own biases \"jury trials are really nothing more than poorly written stage plays you've got two authors writing opposing narratives and a director who is paid not to care about either outcome hired actors sit on either end of the stage while unwitting audience members strive to remain quiet no applause should be rendered no gasps of glory witnesses sit agape with fury as they stumble across their rehearsed lines if only they had practiced just once more if only they had more time or a dress rehearsal then they would recite their packaged words with such eloquent delivery that the critics in the jury box would believe only them \"","1078":"this could have been should have been better it starts with an interesting premise but had for my taste an overly snarky voice it was engaging enough with an interesting twist at the end but overall it wasn't very satisfying","1079":"i won this book through a goodreads giveaway i thought it was pretty good i was a little disappointed","1080":"ijust read it and feel creepy it's just a creepy story with creepy characters","1081":"intriguing waiting to see what she does next","1082":"i would give it 3 5 i want it to be more than what it was sleep toward heaven","1083":"2 5 stars but i'm rounding down all the characters in this book are hideously unlikable the author did a good job keeping me interested until i found out the plot twists which turned out to be disappointing and in some cases bizarre but overall this book irked me there were many passages that i skimmed over because who really cares i e description of every single juror last meals of other death row inmates last statements of other death row inmates these things did not help develop this story in the least what was the point","1084":"amazing well written intriguing","1085":"great read fast and furious if you enjoy psychological thrillers read this book heavy on similes and metaphors but done well in the characters' voices","1086":"finished last night it's an unusual read held me captive but i'm not entirely sure the anticipation was worth the ending well written and not a bad first novel this is one i might have to read again in a while one good and unexpected twist which really adds to understanding noa's guarded nature","1087":"i despised all of the characters and hated the ending the book started strong with great writing but became insufferable after about page 40","1088":"i couldn't put down this book it was suspenseful but gave you enough little bits throughout the entire story to keep you reading it would definitely be a great book club book because all i wanted to do was to talk to someone else who has read it and to discuss capital punishment her defense etc it is certainly one of my favorite books so far this year","1089":"i agree with many of the other reviews this book leaves you hanging with questions about noa's motives the relationship between caleb and sarah marlene and sarah","1090":"this book was interesting especially as a debut novel but i was a bit let down at the end the write up for the book made it seem much more mysterious than it actually was although a provocative topic as well as seemingly innocent people are not and vice versa to me made a rather compelling argument against the death penalty for all sorts of reasons","1091":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this novel started off with a pretty extreme level of sarcasm u0026amp quirk to noa's thoughts and speech it lessened as the book went on which was good and made sense as she was scheduled to be executed as a character noa was secretive and distant leaving me unable to connect or care much about her story every character was less than fully formed and the relationships between them seemed like a stack of

prison didn't feel real court didn't feel real having a miscarriage in the library didn't feel real growing up with a negligent mother didn't feel real it was all so sketchy u0026amp distant but that didn't mask that there was no underlying truth soul guts credibility just a lot of weird metaphors and falsely ransacked rooms i have never read a novel where more couches got knifed in vain this review sums it up a bit more eloquently more","1092":"i'm not sure i can even say i really finished this book it was too depressing and confusing so i skimmed to get the gist of did she do it or not and then called it a day","1093":" noa is on death row for the murder of sarah sarah's mother marlene has decided that noa should not die for her crimes so begins the unraveling of the tale of noa sarah marlene and assorted friends and family members of noa every character seems to be hiding the truth from themselves each other and the reader it took me a while to read this book as none of the characters are particularly reliable and the story of an unrepentant killer is not uplifting i will admit that i skimmed some parts of this book but i kept going and never felt like it was time to stop reading i had my theories about what brought noa to death row so i kept reading to discover the answers i wanted noa's truth i wanted her to \"win\" in no way will this book solve the larger issues for the pro or anti death penalty factions but it will make you think about what is and is not a capital murder and who are capital murderers if some people are born with advantages then some are born with no chance as noa shares \"equality is a messy thing \"","1094":"an interesting look at a woman on death row for killig another woman who was dating her father a psychological twist of

ending will not leave you feeling warm and happy it can't it just can't i have been thinking about it since reading the final pages earlier today and there is no other ending this novel is a tragedy the whole sordid deal more","1098":"i really wanted to like this i looked forward to it for months but i just couldn't get into it maybe i'll try again when i'm in a different frame of mind","1099":"the characters' introspection in this book made me wonder about some of those what if scenarios how would i respond to people if i were on death row how would i treat someone if they murdered my child how do we let guilt and grief control our lives how do our poor choices as parents affect our children as adults because perspective was so limited i had to infer a good bit until the last third of the book which i always enjoy while the premise was gripping i didn't get as involved with the story as i thought i would it was a good read but not a favorite for me","1100":"i was so excited for this book based on the synopsis and prologue and i ended up disappointed it was just so boring i wanted to know what happened in the end but i didn't care much about it or any of the characters","1101":"the author of this book owes me several hours of my life back such good reviews but what a disappointment not a singe character is likable with the potential exception of ollie who seems to be one of the only people with any kind of moral code but that is okay however like other reviewers i was left with a what was the point feeling when i found out the true events of the night in question the only word that came to mind was seriously i have seen comparisons with this book and gone girl which was hemingway compared to this don't waste your time or money or a trip to the library for that matter on this book of big promises that just doesn't deliver","1102":"very interesting and thought provoking you either loved or hated the main characters i hated to see the story end but","1103":" see this review on 1776books net http 1776books blogspot com 2013 07 in elizabeth l silver's debut novel the execution of noa p singleton the reader counts down the months until the title character is put to death for her murder crime as is often the case with books nowadays silver switches back and forth between time periods...very effectively i might add as noa is waiting for her november execution date for the murder of sara she gets a prison visit from two people oliver a new lawyer eager to look into her case and surprisingly sara's mother marlene marlene has had a change of heart since noa's trial and even though she still believes noa killed her daughter she does not want her to die for it noa does not want any part of clemency because of the guilt she feels over a twist i guarantee you won't see coming with the narrative told in present day by noa herself and through marlene's letters to a deceased sara the reader is in for a treat with a multidimensional layered tale that's filled with suspense that being said the ending was disappointing and was left way too open ended for my liking with the exception of one or two characters none of them were very likeable or entirely innocent for that matter however for a debut novel the execution of noa p singleton is fascinating and silver definitely kept me reading into the night...until she left me hanging at the end my rating 4","1104":"noa is on death row for murder but the backstory is more complicated than it appears noa's childhood comes out in bits and pieces with a showstopping event with her childhood friend persephone into young adulthood she meets her father who had left them long ago and begins a relationship with him at the same time the victim's mother came to noa trying to get her help in breaking up a relationship between the victim and noa's father","1105":" keep an eye out for elizabeth l silver this is her first book and it has appeal on so many levels its hard to pin down to a specific genre mystery social commentary literary fiction overall just a really good story and really good writing what bumped this up from a good debut to really something is the fact that it made me think of my own position on the death penalty and death row cruel and unusual eye for an eye i don't know the answer but i am thinking about it i found myself highlighting many passages and reflecting on the characters silver creates while still being entertained with the author's mystery and wit now we wait for number two provided by the publisher","1106":"awesome smart articulate writing for a first time author thoroughly loved it page turner","1107":" this held my attention very well and there were some real surprises in it noa is waiting on death row when the highly placed lawyer mother of the victim decides that she wants to form an organization to go against the legality of the death penalty using noa as the example but noa will not speak to her on the terms she wants to impose the history and what happens are chaptered by time frame a different type of book good characterizations good conversations described and reactions i knew them all through my own eyes from this can't say more without going into spoilers and i do not want to do this to this book","1108":"wow what a powerful story amazing debut","1109":"really interesting premise

hassidic judaism the syntax and pace all helped to bring home the concept of how traumatized the community was by the hatred they experienced at the hands of the nazis i had not truly understood why it seemed to be such a driving force and sacred duty for them to have many children it is to replace those lost to the holocaust this was not a tender story by any means but one that hooked me from the first words it was very well written and i would read another book by this author","3":" as always it is interesting for me to read historic fiction and learn something new in this particular book it meant learning about satmar hasidic jews with their strict extremely restrictive way of life forbidding any free will and freedom of choice it was a very unsettling feeling however to read about this community especially since i am jewish we share the same ancestors and at the same time we are galaxies apart i never want to be in the position to judge anybody's religious beliefs however it is difficult to draw a line between religious faith and insanity in this book and it makes me very sad that religious fanaticism is most likely still a reality for many people who are part of this community with all its consequences jewish laws are full of wisdom kindness and hope however someone unfamiliar with jewish culture might be left with a completely opposite impression after reading this book the reader has to keep in mind that people described in the book are only one of many religious branches of judaism i am sure this way of life works well for certain people but unfortunately when it does not a person becomes forbidden and either becomes estranged from the family or much more tragically might end their life like judith did in this book boy am i glad to be free and choose my own destiny","4":"interesting and moving book about hasidic jews a real tear jerker","5":"i've got to start this review by saying that this type of book is not really my cup of tea yet i did find myself interested by this glimpse inside a world that most of the world knows little or nothing about the most insular sect of hasidic jews the satmar learning about this way of life is the main attraction of the book and anouk markovits presents it unflinchingly i'm sure she related closely to the character of atara--the daughter who leaves the sect as a teenager and must forever live outside the community--as the author bio indicates that this was her own circumstances in life it must have taken a great deal of courage and soul searching to decide to write this book and share the view of the community the story begins in transylvania in world war ii a young boy witnesses the murder of his entire family and is taken to be raised by a christian maid a young girl sees her parents killed before her eyes before being rescued by the boy both of them are rescued by zalman stern a highly regarded rebbe who arranges for the boy to live in america while he brings the girl to france to live with his own family as a daughter the fates of these two children are intertwined and we witness their journeys and relationship as it develops over the years filled at times with joy and life and at times with deep sorrow and tragedy i am forbidden makes you think i know that i found learning about the satmar community to be fascinating yet it made me grateful that it wasn't my fate to be born into such a religion although the book clearly indicates why one would choose to leave the community it also shows why such a decision would be incredibly difficult i imagine that the rituals laws and rules might provide incredible comfort for many yet it is easy to see how a person with a questioning mind and inquisitive soul would seek the wider world rather than stay in such an insular community the writing style of the book is somewhat poetic by which i mean fragmented and dream like at times rather than a straightforward narrative and filled with hebrew terms that sometimes made for a challenging reading experience however there is a glossary at the end of the book that defines some of the hebrew terms however i never found myself completely lost while reading if you just give yourself over to the ebb and flow of the story you'll find a glimpse inside a world that is wildly different from the world most of us know","6":"fabulous the best book i have read all summer i was mesmerized from the first page fell in love with the characters even though i was frustrated by their choices all were made for love","7":"i really wanted to like this book more but the story and characters were so suffocating multi generations of an ultra orthodox jewish family i heard the author speak giving her reasons for focusing on the structure of the community and how some people thrive and others may rebel like she did i get it but","8":"well i burned through this one too a great story full review to come","9":"this is a book about orthodox judaism the premise is that mila cannot conceive after 10 years of marriage in jewish law the husband is then granted the opportunity to divorce her because she is barren mila has a one time encounter with a stranger and voila she is finally pregnant meanwhile her husband josef has finally decided to get himself tested going against jewish law to do so simultaneously as mila breaks the good news to josef about her pregnancy josef gets the news that he will never be able to father a child thus he knows that mila has cheated on him and the dilemma is of course shall josef stay silent or tell the rebbe thus shunning mila from the community there is so much to learn from this book a complete enlightenment for me","10":"interesting look at super orthodox life not great but an interesting readd","11":"good but really really sad","12":"very interesting well written book about a world most of us will never know highly recommend","13":"very moving a thought provoking look at hasidic life and its horrors","14":"i learned a lot about a culture i didn't know much about which is why i gave 4 stars but i was disapointed not to learn more about how atara survived outside her community or how josef was influenced by his adoptive christian mother","15":" some strong characters and passages sometimes stilted and awkward glad i read it which i did after reading catherine the great and before seeing wajdja all of which reminded me how deeply fucked most women are and how i live in a little cocoon of personal liberty in all of the above a woman's value is explicitly tied to her ability to produce a male heir and knowing when to keep her mouth eyes and ears shut the alternative is flight exile abandonment isolation which isn't to say that the men get off easy argh","16":" \"the postman on his bicycle she envied him envied his wheels kissing the cobbles that he knew one language only one country only envied his undivided past undivided from his future \" markovits' i am forbidden is by far one of my favorite adult books of 2012 her novel is filled with a stifling air i do not mean that the book itself is stifling but that the actual subject and predicaments of a hasidic jewish life create this atmosphere in the novel i have seen and studied judaism including hasidim i was already well aware of how strict and formal the culture is however this story seemed too personal to view objectively the summary of this book is as follows a family is torn apart by fierce belief and private longing in this unprecedented journey deep inside the most insular sect of hasidic jews the satmar opening in 1939 transylvania five year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard and is rescued by a christian maid to be raised as her own son five years later josef rescues a young girl mila after her parents are killed while running to meet the rebbe they hoped would save them josef helps mila reach zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in whose home mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara with the rise of communism in central europe the family moves to paris to the marais where zalman tries to raise his children apart from the city in which they live mila's faith intensifies while her beloved sister atara discovers a world of books and learning that she cannot ignore a beautifully crafted emotionally gripping story of what happens when unwavering love unyielding law and centuries of tradition collide i am forbidden announces the arrival of an extraordinarily gifted new voice and opens a startling window on a world closed to most of us goodreads com i just want to state that this does not even begin to hint at the world the reader is thrown into from reading this summary i was expecting a double perspective of life one as a hasidic jew and the other as a renouncer of hasidim this is not the case we do see these two girls mila and atara grow in separate directions mila though is our main character it is her story of the true hasidic that we follow i actually do not know how to put into words what this book is about because i think it is an experience that readers should go in blindly the expression shit hit the fan can cover this book i think not only does shit hit the fan but it then is spread on the walls and floors as mila and josef desperately try to clean up the mess and keep on going with life also sins of the father doesn't even begin to cover the ending of this book it was so surprising and at the same time so sad because it was expected i guess you shouldn't be surprised at the ending but something inside of me wanted to keep the false happiness built by mila and josef through out almost 30 40 years what i liked 1 atara okay i don't like people being suppressed even if it is cultural religious and accepted atara was the voice of modern age thinking she chose to question history during a time of reflection the end of wwii she is also brave not that mila isn't it is just that atara had to chose the right life for her and that can be difficult especially if you lose family 2 fluidity there are no chapters just books i guess the separation of books within the novel and the city year headings could be thought of as chapters i just like that one minute you would experience a situation through mila atara josef's perspective and then right underneath you would see it through the other person's perspective while the story continues so that you are not stuck on the same scene for more than a page this can be tough on some people but my best advice is to breathe and read don't think that will only make it worse 3 history i do like when novels incorporate history but what i like most of this book is that this is a history more in depth there wasn't an overview of what went on or what the world experienced but of what a particular family from a particular sect of people mila josef and atara did not have to endure the camps but mila and josef did lose family it wasn't just a history of the holocaust and how that effected their life but a history of a family who happened to live through the holocaust i hope that makes sense i highly recommend this book if you like anna karenina there are some similarities but it's all about people trying to find their place in their world and the world at large","17":" my pick for passover a story about the satmar jews fundamentalist hasidic with difficult exploration of the satmar rebbe s unethical survival of ww2 the rigors of orthodox law moving acrossvromania paris williamsburg it is beautifully lyrically written with the cadence of yiddish and niggunim song and mostly focuses on 2 girls choosing arranged marriage or freedom which severs all familial and community ties interestingly the author was raised in the satmar community left it and chose to explore the issues of survival anti zionism fundamentalist mores marriage infertility anti semitism in very complex small circles because the novel would allow us to see and hear the humanity of the characters to view their humanity and vulnerability with some tenderness truthful difficult to empathize and very compelling to read for those who think there are only a few types of jews in the world this gives an almost exotic honest look at orthodoxy","18":"a fascinating look into hasidic judaism that explores gender and religious teachings and that eternal question of whether the ends justify the means","19":"excellent i really enjoyed how the history tied to the present","20":" beginning during wwii this novel spans four generations of satmar hasidic jews from eastern europe to brooklyn ny the author was formerly part of this community herself nevertheless i do not detect bitterness in her tone she writes with tenderness her style is sparse yet beautiful like a piece of lace she is able to explore character and motivation without over writing i am interested in religious fundamentalist communities of various faiths here as in others there seem to be some common characteristics a domineering leader who is often hypocritical no questions tolerated suppression of women and strict gender roles the story is compelling i ached for the lack of forgiveness of both self and others experienced by the characters and the legalism that kept them in a sort of spiritual bondage i finished with a much deeper appreciation for grace","21":"i received this book through the first reads giveaway program on goodreads a beautiful yet heartbreaking story","22":"this was a fascinating view of the history of the horrific time endured during the holocaust by a religious group that is still closed to outsiders all the more interesting because we learned about shanghai saving 20 000 jews who were willing to leave europe very good writing","23":"this is a heartbreaking story of an insular hasidic sect the satmar the author comes from that world and does a good job of conveying its rigid thinking and customs unfortunately the story doesn't flow very well and then jumps ahead in time without delving into key characters i'm left with many questions about motives and details as well as a sadness for people so bound by stricture","24":"this is a stark look at what happens when the rigid rules of faith become more important than the relationships they should guide i found the insight into the hasidic tradition eye opening and i am amazed that they are able to maintain a high degree of insulation from the world in these modern times","25":"wow just wow this book was amazing and amazingly sad my heart broke for every single character in this book it did truly show the power of religion whether that power is good or not is up for you to decide","26":"fascinating insight into an unknown culture and world","27":"rated meh after reading about 1 3 of it","28":"despite the inside look at a very tight knit closed religion which i'm usually all about this book was too dry","29":" this is a very interesting novel about 2 orphans joseph and mila who are rescued from nazi occupied romania by satmar rabi zalman stern the both grow up in the satmar community - mila in france with the rabbi and his family and joseph in the new williambsburg n y community in the u s eventually the 2 marry the book gives you a fascinating glimpse into the satmar world and its rules morals and values which always need to be questioned note if the great rabbi could do what he did to survive the holocaust then can't all rules be stretched and interpreted to one's own benefit","30":"i really enjoyed this book this new writer starts off with a strong start to this novel setting the stage in transylvania during world war ii the book follows two jewish children throughout their lives describing centuries of jewish tradition and forklore which i was educated on and taking you thru thier twisted in fate adult lives the ending was not as strong as the begining however i look forward to reading more books from anouk markovits","31":"i had high expectations for this book and the topic seemed really intriguing but it didn't keep my interest the first third of the book was great then the narrative became fragmentary and disjointed though this was an undeniably intimate glimpse into hasidic life i couldn't connect with the characters especially mila in her desperation to have a child their strict adherence to jewish laws makes them feel distant to one another and to the reader this extreme devotion to their faith only curses future generations and leads to tragedy though this was a detailed portrayal of the hasidic community i felt the story fell short because of the style of the writing i received a complimentary copy of this book via the amazon vine program","32":"this started out a little slow for me poetic language but i couldn't figure out what was going on then it picked up and i was immersed in this world of rules rules that keep apart people who love each other one astonishing storyline is about how the satmar rebbe escaped romania and made it to the united states some characters are willing to confront the truth some prefer the fable perhaps a 3 5 star book but worth a bump up","33":"a good book being very famailiar with that community it made the read more intereting if you are curious about that group then this is a good book","34":"wasn't what i'd expected the character was dark and not so likable","35":"it wasn't what i expected kept me intrigued with the inside look at an orthodox jewish marriage i liked it very much","36":"this was an enjoyable read i really enjoyed reading about the jewish life their religious convictions and how it shaped their worldview even though this was a culture and language that i was for the most part unfamiliar with markovits wrote in such a way that i was able to hear the language their use of idioms or jewish slang yiddish i think it's called and yet it didn't get in the way of my reading or comprehension she provides a helpful glossary at the back of the book i appreciated the realism that was created by one decision that produce a tension between tragedy and reward","37":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here heart ache of a book and more information about hasidic life than i had known before very well written and hard to put down","38":"interesting to learn about a religion i know nothing about","39":"outstanding and penetrating writing the story was engrossing and multilayered","40":"i mixed feelings about the book mostly because when i heard about it i thought it was based on a true account of the author's life realizing it was a novel changed the way i felt about it somewhat but didn't make reading it any less interesting i guess not a fan of the ending","41":"i loved the story very well written i think it definitely helped that i've already read so much about hasidic communities and watched some documentaries","42":"fascinating quick read","43":"i love history and i loved learning about the history and the religion of this book it is hard for me to grasp the fanaticism of the hasidim and personally i could never ever follow such a religion very sad and insular world","44":"the book is a great discussion book but it bothered me there were points that i didn't want to listen anymore i believe that mila suffered from mental illness i am not sure why joseph led the life that he did lack of communication in any culture causes disaster a minor issue in the beginning of the book joseph is 5 years old and all of a sudden he is 12 there is plenty of foreshadowing so you kind of know what's coming it doesn't make it any better","45":"fascinating one of the best books i have read in a long time","46":"a journey into a world i know nothing about a particular sect of hasidic judaism i felt horrified transported enthralled moved i don't want to say more before the book group discussion","47":"well written and better than most stories about drop outs from ultra orthodoxy or any cult for that matter interesting twist is that the story is from the perspective of one who stayed rather than one who left","48":"this book took me by surprise as my hopes for it were entirely to low perhaps it's because i've read many books about the hasidic sect of judaism but this book steps very far apart from those i've read before this author can write and it's seems that based on her own personal history she writes what she knows although there was a slightly elusive beginning to this book and i felt like i was lost it took no time to grab me and suck me in to this fanatical world of the hasidic sect called the satmar from the fields of transylvania to the streets of both paris and williamsburg ny this story unfolds between two sisters and a boy from their past who watched his family be murdered by the nazi's this book presents us with ethical questions within religion the love of family the full circle of life and the choices we make and ultimately how they affect others beautifully written is many short chapters and short sections some of which read like lines of poetry i highly recommend this book no matter your religion because the central themes are paramount to everyone while you learn about the satmar sect as well","49":"heartwarming little book interesting to see the way others live","50":"an excellent book i've never read anything like it had some trouble with the names vocab but was still able to follow the story","51":"confusing depressing there is an expectation that the reader should have way more than a basic understanding of the jewish religion i have a decent understanding of the religion and the orthodox sect yet just couldn't grasp what was going on it was too ethereal i was hoping to learn more because i find it fascinating but floundered the story was not new or interesting to me i've read so many shades of this genre that it just fell flat","52":" an emotionally gripping story of what happens when unwavering love unyielding law and centuries of tradition collide i am forbidden opens a window on a world of the strictest most insular sect of hasidic jews the satmar where every action and word is regimented by the law and tradition this novel follows the younger generation of one family and how it is torn apart by fierce belief and private longing the novel opens in 1939 transylvania as 5 year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard and is rescued by a young christian maid to be raised as her own son five years later josef rescues a young jewish girl mila and helps her reach the home of zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in turn josef is rescued from his adopted home and sent to live in america with the rebbe and his new community of hasidic jews meanwhile mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara zalman tries to raise his children apart from the city in which they live mila's faith intensifies while her beloved sister atara discovers a world of books and learning that she cannot ignore the choices atara mila and josef make as young adults will have consequences for all of them and for generations to come","53":" i guess this book was good it was dark and hard to read which isn't always my cup of tea but doesn't make it a bad book it also was so similar to some stuff i read by naomi ragen years ago that i felt like i had read it before all of that said it was a good story with some interested history i never knew before i was also taken by the author's bio raised in a satmar home in france broke away to avoid an arranged marriage has among other things a master of architecture from harvard and a previous novel written in french i kinda like this lady","54":"wow i'm still in awe of this author and novel","55":" i usually do not write reviews but this book was very good educational in many ways teaching me things about another way of life that sounds more unusual than foreign this book is not the type of book i normally read but i could not put it down the moral i learned from this book is that we all make mistakes some that affect future generation but we do it to survive the trials of our lives i believe that god forgives our transgressions if we are truly sorry and one must have faith in that god whatever faith we are to live our lives the best we possibly can","56":"just finished this book can't recommend it enough it's such a compelling and sad story but a real page turner couldn't put it down","57":"stark and compelling from start to finish","58":" this book puts flesh and blood hopes and dreams onto the otherwise typical wooden caricatures of the ultra orthodox it is a tragic story of loyalties in tension faith and freedom at odds and a hunger for truth and righteousness the characters are multidimensional and it's not difficult for the reader to find aspects of each to identify with the book actually picks up pace from start to finish and by the end it's hard to put down for those wanting a deeper understanding of the hasidic community this book is a must","59":"disturbing heartbreaking extremist religious beliefs","60":"3 5 stars pretty typical multi generational family holocaust story nice writing in a lot of places pretty portrait of a marriage better written than a lot of them much better than naomi ragen but overall probably not particularly memorable but we'll see if any of it sticks with me","61":" the novel begins in transylvania as we are introduced to zalman stern a rigidly religious satmar hasidic jew he is a follower of this sect which bridges no compromises in the practice of religion he is well known as a devout scholar the book then continues on to tell the story of josef lichtenstein a small boy who witnesses the murder of his family both josef and zalman are connected for both are miraculously spared from death on the same day in 1939 as others are wantonly murdered josef is instrumental in the rescue of mila heller which is another connection to zalman stern since both children eventually wind up under his tutelage both mila and josef have been orphaned by the tragedy of events leading up to and including world war ii josef spies mila and her family hiding near where he lives with his second mother florina he sees mila's mother gunned down by nazis as she runs to her \"rebbe\" who is sitting in an open \"special\" cattle car for prominent people who are being rescued from the germans although this fact is not known to her the \"rebbe has all the answers and is sought out to solve all problems when the \"rebbe\" told every jew under his jurisdiction that they must not leave their land they must tear up their papers to palestine they must not be zionists they obeyed him he said the religion forbade them from leaving their homes and land and forbade them to fight against their enemies it was g d's job to do that then he saved himself explaining his rescue with a story about having a dream that it was g d's will that he be saved and sent to america that story didn't sit well with me it actually filled me with disgust as his followers believed and justified the hypocrisy of his behavior he had condemned them to death knowing what awaited them but spared himself i had to remind myself that this was a novel josef protected mila by forcing her to remain with him and to keep silent so that she was not shot like her mother or caught as her father soon was he was later tortured and murdered more mature than their young years the children josef and mila find her father and bury him mila was told by her father that she should seek out zalman stern in the event of an emergency and josef does what he can to help her find him josef introduces himself to mila as anghel florina who had formerly worked for josef's parents was busy robbing their apartment after their brutal murders by jew haters when she found josef hiding under a table in the apartment florina did not like jews they were non believers but she loved josef oddly this is just one of the strange parallels in the book since the belief mirrors that of the satmar hasids who believe non believers should be ostracized avoided and perhaps punished florina takes josef with her and tells him never to reveal that he is a jew she has him baptized gives him the name anghel and raises him as a christian for the next 7 years when zalman stern learns from mila that the child he occasionally sees watching him on the road is jewish he makes several attempts to rescue him and when the war is over after many years of unsuccessful effort he finally does josef anghel is now 12 years old he is brought back into the fold lives with zalman and is eventually sent to america to study further and also to remove him from the pull of florina a good jewish male studies relentlessly a good jewish female supports him and is a good wife and mother with the rise of communism it becomes more difficult to practice judaism in rumania zalman decides to move his remaining family to paris where he takes a position as cantor he is a strict observer and religious observance there disappoints him his disposition changes and he becomes more intolerant more anxious his eldest daughter atara wants an education and when he refuses and threatens to lock her up until he marries her off she runs away abandoning her religious life because of his intransigence and its limitations on her freedom and independence she is mourned by zalman as if she had died meanwhile mila who has been raised by zalman and his wife hannah since the death of her parents remains home and grows more devout eventually she is betrothed to josef and she moves to america to join him she has fulfilled her dreams when mila does not conceive a child the community begins to whisper about her years pass a husband is allowed to divorce a barren wife after a certain amount of time she resorts to an odd interpretation of the religious doctrines and finds a way to become pregnant unfortunately it is at that time that josef also circumnavigates jewish law and finds out he is sterile when mila gives birth to a child the marriage is irreparably damaged although josef loves the child he suffers emotionally and mentally punishing himself ever after causing his body to deteriorate physically the novel explores the effect of fanatic religious observance on the people and life itself in these communities will tragedy continue to follow them will it be g d's will to punish them for their sins can they find loopholes in commentaries to justify what each has done are the personal tragedies as well as the larger ones including the holocaust as the hasids believed the result of disappointing their g d of not being a \"good enough practicing jew\" of somehow disappointing their g d thereby preventing the messiah from coming to save them this is a book that tells a story steeped in the customs and culture of a devout and fanatic jewish sect it will raise questions and concerns in the minds of all readers about the rights of women and about the approach of these believers to those who do not believe it felt like i was reading about a sect that had a deep abiding love and belief in the word of their g d but overhanging it all were the constant threats of impending punishment and doom banishment from the community if they were not blindly obedient rigid demands for fanatic observance is the same in other religions as well but does that justify the intolerance this was a difficult novel for me to review and a difficult book to rate it moved me fiercely emotionally in many conflicting directions as i read it it left me with many unanswered questions it presented a picture of hasidic judaism that opened my eyes to both their love of the religion and the rigidity of it it pulled me in polar opposite directions as i read it first respecting the observance than disrespecting the intolerance of the observers i wondered how such strict adherence to rules especially by the women who had few rights was possible and then i thought it is possible because every instance in their lives is governed by a rule questions about the rules are answered unequivocally by the rabbi and their education is completely controlled and limited they are only permitted to read certain books and most have no idea or desire for an independent life in the outside world because it simply does not exist for them they are forbidden to mix with non believers and they are brought up to believe that transgressions will be severely punished by g d or the community the rabbi always has the last world on all behavior i was forced to realize that most fanatic religions are like this and i shuddered because that is the reason there is such disharmony in the world there is no room for compromise","62":"this book was sharp and stunning many parts are sad even horrific as peoples lives warp and change around this core of hassidic jewish traditions i held the book with a sort of attracted weary respect i devoured the first half of the book but once atara has left the scene the book just seemed to slow and the plot dried just a bit i felt like the point had been made and it might have been more efficient to start wrapping up earlier not to demerit the later parts of the book but i felt like the important moral conflict plot segment had already risen and fallen and the next chunk of time felt like kind of a hazy grey area in the big picture the plot swiftly picked back up to it's former stride with rachel and then judith but it felt a little weird to me that judith got the climax i barely knew her at all and although she was clear with her point of view and the writing easily conveyed her personality it just felt a bit jolting that i was suddenly so deep in her emotions i actually dreamed about this book before i started reading it in my dream i was the bad daughter everyone was running around in hell but then there was this rope and all the jews could elevate to heaven or whatever but i couldn't because i had sinned","63":"a fascinating book tracing several generations in an ultra orthodox jewish community from their roots in transylvania to a post war settlement in new york","64":"i really enjoyed this book the characters and story were engaging i also enjoyed learning about the hasidic jewish religion and wwii history related","65":" i cried at the end of this book i was hoping against all hopes that everything would work out in this fairytale ending kind of way but of course this book was reflective of real satmar family community beliefs and customs and so things turned out tragically for some of the characters for those of you who are unaware of what the satmar is it is the most insular hasidic sect of judaism they have alot of rules and they take them all seriously devout is too weak a word to describe this community this books spans a few generations of a satmar family starting with jews in war torn europe during wwii who survived the purges also known as the holocaust we are introduced to mila an adopted daughter of rabbi zalman who becomes deeply devout and wants nothing more than to be a wife and mother something she feels is necessary to honor the lives of her lost parents and the other lost jews of europe and we are met with atara the biological daughter of rabbi zalmon who defies her father's wishes and who leaves her community in order to pursue her dreams of changing lives and becomes ostracized something she felt was necessary because she could not follow hashem god with blind obedience this novel was beautifully written thank you anouk markovits thank you","66":"love this bookthis book was of lives and culture of which i have no knowledge but i was mesmerized by it i stayed up reading all night i cared for these characters i despaired with them felt trapped i don't believe you have to be jewish to empathize with their lives this book moved me best book i have read in a long time","67":"love this book i am recommending it to my book club","68":" this is very well written and contains information about the jewish religion of which i was unfamiliar you learn a lot about hasidim and the very strict rules by which they live their relationship to zionists it opens in 1939 but says very little about world war ii at the beginning there is more later on one scene stuck in my mind where the very strict father whips his daughter with his belt for riding a friend's bicycle in a park on sunday after this she is hiding under her bed and eventually comes out and just walks away nothing is said of her injuries which had to be severe counting the number of blows she received that was a little disconcerting this beating causes her to run away and renounce the jewish religion the girl raised as her sister on the other hand marries with the religion well work reading","69":"this is a poetically written glimpse into a tightly constrained world the characters are written to be about as complex as any people reinforcing the overall impression that religious orthodoxy within any faith does far more harm than good to the human spirit i did feel that the period between the birth of the main character's daughter and the events surrounding her granddaughter were far too much of a blur","70":" this was an intriguing and fascinating story it is about the satmar hasidism coming from eastern europe before world war ii and settling in paris and the united states the author who comes from a satmar household glosses over a lot of the war and at times it seems like this family lived in a bubble of course that may be true since they're hasidic but the story is very well written and surprising i had read a review in hadassah magazine and am very glad that i went to the trouble of getting the book","71":"interesting book to follow up luminarium","72":"wonderful perspective on what it takes to walk away from ones faith and what it takes to stay opens a little window on the world of fundamentalist satmar jews would love to discuss this with my book club","73":"good quick read","74":"could not put it down very fast read","75":"i thought this was a beautifully written book the author draws on her own experiences in the orthodox jewish community of her upbringing so she has great knowledge of the topic when writing the characters background for her novel etc a lot of people that choose to leave their original faiths for new faiths can be angry hurt and willing to attack their original faith communities anouk does a beautiful job in this novel of not following that pattern of behavior instead i felt the book was very educational especially for someone interested in learning about orthodox jewish communities but with limited knowledge critical while respectful key to the success of the book personally i am fascinated with the theologies of all traditions so i appreciated a lot of the history actual theology and then the ways in which the author brought it all to life with the novel's actual story line i thought her method of following two characters mila taking the orthodox route and atara leaving the community in an effort to have access to more freedom of thought and study was brilliant both characters made choices that they each felt appropriate for them personally i would have liked to see atara with a more developed future i e husband kids professional success rather than seeming damaged by her leaving the orthodox community and lonely thereby showing it is possible to leave a faith and find new ways of living in all aspects of life but at the same time yes leaving such a tight knit community is upsetting and going it alone without family is isolating it's much like leaving one's country of birth and forever after being a refugee without country you're rather a pioneer having to create your own new community with other like minded pioneers i think that happens with all people who change their faith communities no longer fitting in the old community but being too different to fit in to new communities in this way i would have liked to have had the author share more of atara's story rather than the dominant mila's story maybe in the author's next book regardless the author is clearly a very talented beautiful writer of great skill the writing style pacing story development were all really well done and i became quite attached to the characters id highly recommend the book","76":"thought babrate 3 stars who baby miles and joesphe to divorced and marry confuse happens i mills baby l believe story","77":" a man runs naked to the aron kodesh a boy

meanwhile with aid from the zionists is on his way to safety in switzerland full review here http zackarysholemberger com 2012 0","78":" this was a fascinating look at the world of ultra orthodox judaism this is a woman's story told by a woman who ultimately left the fold in order to avoid an arranged marriage she writes of education marriage dictated customs rules and forbidden activities what is so interesting is that this story did not just transpire in the distant past in the old country but continued in new york in the middle of the 20th century the life shown in this novel was more or less lived by markovits until she left her jewish family and community in the late 1990's this is a novel about free choice or limitless obedience about finding happiness through belonging to a community closed in its tradition or through independence and individuality this book really made me think","79":"this was a completely original story despite the ubiquity of holocaust novels the characters were believable and unique the style is a little difficult to get used to at first the sentences are very short and terse but i loved the setting and the span of time covered during the plot i'm definitely going to recommend this to others because of the author's gripping storytelling","80":"by far the better written of the two books i've read back to back dealing with the struggles of the main characters both women trying to maintain their identity and courage among the satmars","81":"through the book and we only hear of her at the end mira is 10 years without get there's a description of a space in a synagogue where the women are separated from the men the women have to look through the holes in the screen to see what the men are doing during a service throughout this book it felt like there was a screen between the author and the reader never quite giving me enough emotion enough detail enough plot structure to be able to get into this book atara runs away about a  1\/3  through the book and we only hear of her at the end mira is 10 years without getting pregnant over a few pages and besides the obvious that this is not good in her world how is she coping with this how is she living for 10 years just watching her menstrual cycles for 10 years it's as if the screen is purposely there so we are only to know a finite amount about these characters i would have liked this book a lot more if the author had pulled back the screen and changed the plot structure alternate chapters between atara and mira and what is conversely happening in their lives i wanted to learn more about hasidic culture and i did find the appendix in the back that had a dictionary of terms i would have liked it better if the book had included these definitions and footnotes on the pages where they are relevant not in the back of the book one more screen","82":"there was nothing particularly wrong with this book but i just didn't find any part of it engaging maybe it was my mood but none of the characters were deep enough and it had such great promise i think i got my hopes up the story seemed to focus on the characters i didn't want to know more about and not enough the ones that i did","83":"i had heard negative remarks about the book so it took me by surprise started and finished it brilliant","84":"very heavy read good thought provoking but heavy about jewish religion","85":"interesting story about orthodox jewish life which being half jewish of hungarian descent should appeal to me unfortunately religious novels aren't my niche a well written novel about conflict of belief it kept my attention but did not blow me away","86":"interesting story","87":"wanted to like this more than i did","88":"i would not have made a good hasidic jew this book is sad u0026amp sad it was good i read it really quickly u0026amp am glad i did but what a tragic story","89":"this is the second book i've read recently on the same theme coincidence on my part but maybe it is a hot topic just makes me shake my head in wonder about all the ways people choose to be a person","90":"written by a woman who left her satmar chassidic family and community this book was hard to put down it was a very interesting portrayal of life amongst the satmar chassidim it was however quite depressing in some ways and had some disturbing themes","91":"a beautifully written novel that tells a heart rending story this was the best novel of the year for me i am still thinking about this book and how much the author has given in her writing a truly well written and heart felt book","92":"it was fascinating reading about the rituals and customs of the ultra orthodox and the impact that it has on their lives","93":" i am forbidden by anouk markovitsthree children who survive the destruction of their orthodox jewish communities during wwii are followed throughout their lives one survives because his catholic nanny hides him as her son until he is \"restored\" to judaism after the war one survives because that same boy prevents her from following her mother and father to certain death the third survives because her family is fortunate enough to escape to neutral land and then paris after the war the aftermath of the war influences all the decisions secrets and separations that follow them all their lives the ultra orthodox community is sympathetically rendered as is the decision of one of the three to leave that insular and confining faith the characters and faith are presented with clarity book groups will discover the lifestyle of the orthodox and its ramifications a discussion of the decisions of the three characters and the decision of a granddaughter should lead to a lively conversation 4 of 5 stars","94":"two thumbs up the characters were interesting and believable the plot moved quickly fascinating look into the world of ultra orthodox jews","95":"absolutely beautiful","96":"i really liked this book the characters are well crafted the author brought me into their world and made me care about them with the added benefit of learning about a community which i knew very little i look forward to her publishing more books in english","97":"an insightful book covering the hasidic jews it is a sect that live strictly by their interpretation of their scriptures and no deviation is permitted one is not allowed to question any aspect their of faith and blind obedience is de rigeur procreation is upmost in their life and contact with their outside world is strictly monitored","98":" this book is about hasidic jews and their beliefs and laws josef sees his parents and sister killed by nazis and is rescued by his christian housekeeper mila sees her parents killed by the nazis and comes to realize that their rebbi did not want to rescue them from death she is saved by josef when they are both children mila lives with a jewish family in france her sister atara rebels against the rules and lives gently in the world

realizes he is the reason they are childless so he knows he is not the father and does not accept mila's reasoning to make her child acceptable although josef does not let the secret out according to hasidic rule the family is unclean and is not marriageble their daughter rachel has 11 children the oldest is judith judith is devout and when she discovers that she is unclean through mila's diary and a letter to josef from a doctor she commits suicide by jumping in front of a train a week before her wedding the diary and letter are then destroyed by atara josef dies and the secret is never again acknowledged","99":"know very little about the jewish hasidic community and nothing about the satmar hasidic jews the big hats the side curls and the women trailing behind the men this was about all i knew to me they seemed liked the amish of the jewish world anouk markovits gives a glimpse into this world she opens a window just a little uncovering a world of extremes things we take for granted like reading unholy texts are forbidden to this community and for the women the list is longer there are no trips to the goyim world that aren't fraught with peril you may see a roman statue from the corner of your eye or see a catholic church by accident a woman must keep track of the days leading up to and following her period to know when she can have 'relations' with her husband which also cannot happen until she has taken her ritual bath and been declared kosher they definitely cannot visit the library and cannot read a goyim newspaper news outside the community is definitely forbidden i am forbidden's focal point is the satmar a very isolated very regulated hasidic jewish sect the story spans pre world war ii to modern times following two orphan's intermingled lives from transylvania to paris to williamsburg brooklyn it is a tragic love story stemming from people trying to do the right thing make each other happy and follow hasidic law which seems to be impossible to do there is no gray in the satmar community there is black and white man and woman married and unmarried clean and unclean godly and worldly what is right and what is holy aren't always in harmony and this torments the characters the characters live with memories of the holocaust and the troubling thought that their leader may have bargained with nazi leaders to save his own life while not saving his community author anouk markovits grew up in a hasidic home leaving it for a life of freedom and expression she knows of what she writes and i wonder how much of this book comes from her life you feel the pain she felt and understand what went into her decision to leave this book was lovely sad tragic and beautiful it isn't often that a book and make you feel deeply and teach you something all at the same time i definitely recommend this book","100":"i thought this was excellent and it held my interest throught i feel emphathy for people who are restricted","101":" this was an interesting look into hasidic judaism it follows two semi adopted sisters through their lives through world war ii transylvania and into their elderly years in america they each make different choices and have different takes on judaism it was interesting to learn some of the things that happened within the jew community while all of that racism with hitler was going on in the end we are all human and have to stand for the choices we make although in the beginning i thought the hasidic jew beliefs were very restrictive and archaic through mila and her adopted mother hannah and even mila's husband josef i have discovered a new respect for people who choose to live this way they are not bad people who hate women they are people who love their families and just want to live the best life they know how just because i don't agree with them doesn't make them wrong i wish i could read a book like this about everyone i have an opinion on i think it would make this world a more friendly and accepting place i'm glad i read it even if i wasn't completely enchanted as to the book itself story aside it moved very slowly and had little to no action it was sad and full of real life which is always kind of a downer i didn't like the ending i thought it should have ended a couple chapters earlier to make it the most effective but i understand why the author felt she had to tie up the last few loose ends life is sad and i'm sorry for everyone who had to endure what hitler did to their world","102":"the description sounded interesting but the book was actually pretty boring and i felt absolutely no attachment to or emotional investment in any of the characters who i thought were all pretty wooden one dimensional without really any emotional insights or interest","103":"i selected this book for a book group and facilitated an interesting discussion most of the readers were not familiar with satmar sect and we spent a lot of time on their history which required additional research outside of i am forbidden as a companion i also read unorthodox by deborah feldman","104":"a really well written authentic book i could not help but wonder how much of it is biographical but that is actually irrelevant the author writes with confidence creating people whose lives affect you whose actions are true to themselves but still did it have to be so very sad and hopeless maybe i'm reading it incorrectly but this book in the end left me with a deep sadness that all the good writing or possibly different intentions could not erase so read it gentle reader but know that i warned you it's not a weeping and wailing sadness but rather an intense sadness about the frailty of people","105":"good but not really for me","106":"very interesting view into the life of a hasidic jew though the author's personal pain did seem to cloud the story at times","107":"this is a fictional story about four generations of satmar jews an ultra orthodox hasidic group it begins in the second world war and goes through the present day the plot revolves around survival and the choices the characters make in order to survive this is not a cheerful story but there are many memorable haunting images and symbols throughout the text","108":"i received this book from a read it forward drawing that i won i am so glad that i did this is the author's english debut she is a french author the novel begins during wwii in transylvania she tells the story of a young jewish girl whose parents were both shot and killed while trying to escape she is taken and raised in a satmar home a jewish hasidic sect it also tells the story of a young jewish boy whose family was also brutally murdered he was rescued by a gentile woman who took him in as her own son until he is discovered by his own faith and sent to america to further his jewish studies their lives come together in a story that will wrench at your heart as you read about what exactly life and belief is like in a satmar home and how a deep dark secret will change their lives forever having been raised in a satmar home herself the author anouk is able to portray this story so well it is not a happy read but a very good one","109":"read for my book club took a while to get into it but was an ultimately good read where i learned more about hasidic jews","110":"i felt so oppressed and i wasn't part of this world it amazes me how people can use religion to keep their children so ignorant of the world please don't mistake that for me saying you can't have religion and read science books books for pleasure etc that's not what i'm saying","111":"beautifully written fascinating setting would read again the first half is richly developed but the final third left me feeling like the climax and resolution had been hurried or written against a deadline","112":"i learned lots about hasidic jews and what was happening with the jews in europe during hitler's rise to power very educational with an emotional story","113":"this is a very interesting book insofar as explaining some of the beliefs of a very ultra conservative branch of judaism i thought catholics had some hard beliefs to follow but i think the satmar are right up there","114":"an amazing book that totally gripped me however it is not a happy book the rigid adherence to religious views brings sadness and tragedy to the families portrayed","115":"let me first say i hate to give a book a negative review just because i didn't like it doesn't mean someone else won't love it i got to page 53 in this book i just could not get into it at all i can usually force my way through a book and say it's okay but when i find myself dreading not wanting to read i know it is time to close the cover and move on","116":"sad u0026amp depressing kept hoping for some positive resolution but found what little there was lacking","117":"so well written it was a breeze to read love it when that happens i highly enjoyed this novel","118":"i would have given this book 4 stars but the ending felt rushed other than that it was beautifully written","119":"the story follows a hasidic family from transylvania to the us the story line is excellant as the years go by and the families try to follow their law it was a real learning experience an interesting read","120":" the beauty of this book is it's exploration of any religious system or thought that is restrictive and narrow i think it stresses that any fundamental religion that relies on rules to guide our every thought and detail of our life is controlling and punitive such a religious observance robs us of humane thoughts feelings and our curiosity and questioning fundamentalist religions that have leaders in authoritative positions to interpret our lives are to be questioned as are their beliefs this story deals with the jewish hasidim after the initial introduction of the characters time and place the book runs through lifetimes quickly it 's underlying message is about the restrictions of fundamentalist thought and the damage it does in today's culture one often yearns for simple rules and ways to live and wishes for less choices but the consequences of living a rigid directed life are told here in an intense and powerful manner","121":" i dunno i'm perplexed by this book it was darn depressing which doesn't make it bad but i guess i'd say you need to be ready for this one it's not one of those books that washes over you in pleasant stages deepening your enjoyment as you attach to the characters and worry about their circumstances if like me you're fairly unfamiliar with the inside deal on satmar hasidic beliefs and dictates though i am familiar with the daily rhythm of hasidic life having lived for 15 years in mile end and outremont in montreal you may be as confused as i was in trying to keep it all clear in your mind while also absorbing the bleak storyline and chilly author's voice i think for some people out there perhaps especially those with ultra orthodox jewish experience this book might be uniquely resonant even though it's mainly a historical novel i wanted to like it but for me it became a bit of a duty","122":"a fascinating eye opening read","123":" i gave this book four stars for the lovely prose we'll fleshed out characters and enthralling story but that being said it is hard to like this story it is truly heartbreaking at times i am forbidden was hard for me to follow being almost completely ignorant of the hasidic sect and hebrew jewish terms etc i think someone with jewish knowledge or background could better appreciate the story but it is a good story which is why i continued to read it despite my initial confusion the look into the life of an orthodox satmar is also fascinating i think those interested in other cultures and history would also appreciate this book for them and those interested in judaism or at least familiar with it i would recommend this book the story may be hard to follow for ignorants like me but the writing is excellent","124":"when man's law take's precedence over god's many will suffer","125":"fantastic my favorite kind of book excellent writing a story that pulls you in so that your tasks go undone and a book in which you learn something you really couldn't have learned any other way an amazing peek into the lives and customs of hasidic jews from an author that was one before she became 'forbidden' i really hope to hear more from this author","126":"simply fascinating","127":"set in the orthodox jewish community i am forbidden shows how very repressive and destructive extreme religion can be mostly due to the sparse writing style i liked the book but didn't love it and wished there was more no one's ever called me a minimalist","128":"this book follows an ultra orthodox jewish family from around the start of wwii to the near present i ended up not liking the severe direction the author went with this story so it it ended on a low for me i would have liked to have followed more of the story of the daughter who leaves the faith the book does a good job of immersing the reader in the world of this jewish sect and what that life would be like from various perspectives","129":"superb writing stunning story i had no idea how restrictive the lives of people in some jewish sects could be how is this any different than the tyranny of some muslims lyrically descriptive his gaze drifted with a cloud and he thought of florina who called the color of his eyes wood nettle green and prickly topside gray and downy underside in the kitchen with the four poster bed anghel saw florina's love and her helplessness and it washed over him too they shared this moment of losing all of having already lost they changed trains in vienna as the stations went by linz munich stuttgart cities towns villages emptied of jews zalman and hannah recited psalms that streaked their cheeks when the door of his study closed their skipping resumed solemn as the ancient desert threat cast its shadow and flew past she started to read but again the letters stirred the lines written centuries apart joined and then marched together circling her future in a changeless round of faith nothing new could happen not since moses at sinai when mila's eyes opened they were filled not with atara's inebriation but with apology for surviving for being alive atara combed her fingers through mila's disheveled hair combed them toward what she hope might still be the direction of an escape josef pulled bacak his hips and stood a bit hunched coat closed to conceal his twenty two year old ammah rising in praise of mila and hashem she would help even if old hannah and zalman had to hear about their lost daughter enticing a young girl to leave the ancient laws had done enough damage she listened hard for the sound of zalman's voice emerging from inside and then she zigzagged away between the strollers not to cry not before turning the corner not to be seen sobbing not in this street not a sixty four year old woman wearing an immodest kerchief and a collar a half inch short of permitted i read this book during the year i was 64 years old","130":"what a culture description of the narrow mindedness and strictness of the satmars by a woman who experienced life among them and the horror of the holocaust as it affected those in the region of transylvania was very rich and enlightening the book lurched to an end and should have continued with the same depth as at the beginning later characters were not described as fully and richly","131":"like the author of one of the blurbs on the back of the book reading this book i learned some pieces of a history i thought i knew the complexities of the history and status of satmar hasidim in the united states the author's deftness in telling the story sheds light on the terrible conflict between freedom of choice and the comfort in assured doctrine because the particulars of the struggle itself are huge the narrative necessarily shortchanges the story of two women by focusing on one and leaving the other in shadow i feel that autobiographical considerations aside the fiction does not do justice to an examination of the impasse and conversely the weight of the impasse robs the fiction","132":"the story of satmar jews told from the lives of a strictly orthodox woman and her sister who flees the religion and thus her family this was beautifully written and a subject that is rarely addressed it spans from 1930's transylvania to paris to williamsburg in the u s where an enclave of satmars apparently resides eye opening thought provoking and a bit disturbing i would highly recommend this book","133":" like many people i have always had a fascination with the jewish people their history and beliefs so when i am forbidden appeared on the kindle daily deal page for the grand total of 99p it was an instant download the book is the story of two orphaned children a boy and a girl who lost their parents in the holocaust but were themselves survivors linked by their shared history as well as their faith the youngsters eventually become man and wife and part of the hasidic jewish community in williamsburg new york saved by the same rabbi the young boy josef is quickly shipped to the states in order to train as a scholar the girl mila is raised by the rabbi and his family close in age to their daughter atara the story takes us through the lives of the children even as the girls are trained in the art of becoming good jewish wives with atara ultimately rejecting her faith and lifestyle and in turn is rejected by her family once josef and mila are married this novel takes on a more intense and emotional turn the story spans over half a century and provides a great deal of insight into the lives and beliefs of hasidic jews the beauty of a faith which has held sway for so many thousands of years is clearly illustrated particularly in the busy ness of everyday life which then comes to a halt as each member of the community celebrates the sabbath the author does not shy away from the problems which occur when different interpretations lead to different conclusions or the clash of cultures and beliefs in the modern world seemingly illogical to the non jew examples of almost blind faith serve to show the importance of faith and perhaps help illustrate who comforting and strengthening religion ritual and faith can be in the lives of any individual on the whole i enjoyed this book very much it feels like an honest account as if the author has fist hand or inside knowledge of the community she writes about although she clearly shows the role of the women to be vastly different to the men in this patriarchal religion this is done in a matter of fact way rather than in a hostile feminist manner recommended","134":" well written the beginning was interesting the middle got a bit dull and then it sort of went off the rails the introduction of two mystery subplots that weren't all that mysterious or suspenseful felt like a concession to a commercial market after that i kept hearing the plot machinery creak the last two thirds of the book superficially zipped through about 50 years which made it difficult to care about the characters this could have been a great story but it was trying to do so many things at once and in a short space that it didn't live up to the author's well wrought prose","135":" this sweeping tale of family set over 70 years beginning in fascist europe and then in post war france and america presents a fascinating insight into the hidden world of an ultra orthodox hasidic sect within the jewish community essentially for me it is really about the level of pernicious indoctrination that all children of faith undergo in most if not all religions certainly in radical sects such as this as they grow up bringing with it an unquestioning belief system that makes it an impossibly difficult decision to even consider breaking away into the real world of life and freedom to an atheist like myself much of this is just incomprehensible ritual bordering on abuse and mumbo jumbo dressed up to cover over the cracks in the human condition but i would say that about all religions of whatever persuasion this one just seems even more deluded than most saying all that though would most definitely be forbidden i myself would be forbidden my name would never hereafter be spoken by family and friends and i've no doubt at the same time screwed up the return of one the world's multiple end of the world messiahs that's a risk i'll just have to take good and interesting read though about how two sisters and one husband struggle to make sense of it all as they come up against choices in a modern world that in a backwards and inward looking all consuming religious life they are not even supposed to contemplate","136":"if you have ever wanted to learn more about the most insular hasidic sect the satmar this book demonstrates the day to day life of one satmar family the book begins prior to ww ii and continues to current day williamsburg brooklyn the rigidity of the religious sect made for a sad read i kept thinking clearly there must be more joy in these families than is portrayed in this novel","137":"i can't say i liked this book but i found it moving and deeply interesting the commitment to community felt at once foreign and familiar and while i didn't necessarily agree with the characters i found their actions understandable in the circumstances the impressionistic language is a worthwhile hurdle i think you'd appreciate this one deja","138":"i don't actually know how i feel about this book it was well written and parts were compelling but i found it hard to stomach that women were treated so unfairly and accepted it i get that this is part of the particular culture this book was about but it was just so extreme i felt like i learned things and liked the story","139":" this book has everything that interests me in a novel love family sacrifice and learning something new about subjects that interest me in this case hasidim life and tradition add to these matters jewish life during the reign of the nazis secrecy and the suspense of secrets yet undiscovered and you have an entertaining read these are all issues dealt with in i am forbidden ms markovitz is an excellent story teller who inter weaves the lives of well rounded characters in a way that makes the reader care about them i found myself worrying about these people wanting everything to work out well for them and hoping for their happy ending unfortunately such an ending cannot always be the case when we force it or can it much of this novel reminds me a great deal of the writings of naomi ragen in that the author is able to interject rich descriptions of religious jewish traditions and customs with a well written story of family life i loved this book i think you will too","140":"markovits has written a moving portrayal of the fault lines within an orthodox family's relationships and two sisters' struggles with faith and belief","141":"lots of info on satma hassidics wrapped into a good story about love sin and forgiveness","142":"this was chosen as the book for my book group i probably wouldn't have picked it out otherwise it's rather a grim story and at many points i wanted to shake the characters and explain that there were other options and if they'd simply talk to each other things could get better on the hand it seemed like a fitting testament to the power of a tragic history the holocaust in this case that said it was well written and moved quickly","143":" the book begins by beautifully weaving together three separate stories of children trying to survive during world war ii you become attached to young angel and know you'll see him again atara and mila are the other two central characters and the author moves back and forth between giving each girl a voice until unfortunately a certain point where the focus of the story is on mila and then not even entirely and all of a sudden decades pass between pages details have been omitted and you're left at the end shocked mouth open and angered at what passes the idea was interesting but the book seems to have been finished hurriedly with little concern for giving these characters a real chance at ever making it","144":"excellent very interesting immersion into the life and culture of satmar hasidic community of east europe u0026amp williamsburg ny beginning in wwii","145":"thought provoking riveting and left me with a hunger for grace","146":"an interesting story but a bit choppy in spots be ready for a somewhat surprising ending","147":"i loved the very personal insight the author gives us into a community that so few outsiders are allowed to interact with the last few twists and turns in the story felt a little forced but i did appreciate how the author illustrates the concept that our histories continue to shape us long after we believe them to be at rest","148":"very thought provoking","149":"incredible story of the fundamentalist hassad jewish sect","150":"this is not a book i thought i would enjoy but once i started it i found it hard to put down it is a compelling story of the effect that strict adherence to ancient religious beliefs can have on individuals and families it raises many questions that are not easy to answer you don't have to be jewish to be captured and moved by this story","151":" i was amazed that i as a jew knew nothing about the satmar sect of hasidem as i continued to read i would stop with each new revelation that this was the jewish side of rick santorum's unrelenting due to the lack of general education christianity basically forboding as well as forbidden she is a masterful story teller and her prose is profoundly moving unwavering love meets rigid law with such sad consequences it was shocking to me and i could not put it down i look forward to this author s next book","152":"another of those books that gave me a window into a world that i know very little about the world of hasidic judaism it was good but sad and also a little unsatisfying","153":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i read this book in about 36 hours and yet i had an entire relationship with it that ran the gamut of an emotional continuum by the time i received it i had almost forgotten that i had entered the giveaway i did not remember what it was about and frankly the title did not help i had entered because i am interested in reading about other cultures and being a non charedi jew but still a jew i was interested when i read the details for the

being a non charedi jew but still a jew i was interested when i read the details for the giveaway my only contact with satmars was while in israel over 10 years ago i was with a hadassah young leaders tour i noticed a traditionally dressed man across the street in the old city who spit when we passed by our tour guide told us he was a satmar who did not believe in the modern state of israel nor in modern women of jewish descent he would not consider us actual jews we were told but i digress well one more thing i live in a city where the small jewish community shares space a jcc and interacts across the belief lines if you will i know lubavitch families have studied with more than a couple lubavitch girls and went with a group for a shabbaton in crown heights while lubavitchers are known as the proslytizing branch of the ultra orthodox they are still a different culture than what i grew up with the women have a much more free culture than satmar but the modern woman would find their culture limiting i find it beautiful if not the way of life for me i continue to be fascinated which may be one reason i was led to this book same but different so the book it sat in my to be read pile til i finally picked it up out of obligation i thrilled to the first page remembering why i wanted to read it in the first place i gritted my teeth through the nazi era history my son and i just finished reading night by eli wiesel it has been a very holocaust spring for us the more i read the more immersed i became when josef was returned to his jewish brethren leaving his adoptive mother florina who also was casually anti semitic i felt uneasy markovits never takes the easy route at least not in most of the book the contradictions that probably led her to leave her satmar life we are told she was raised as a satmar and left at 19 to escape an arranged marriage in the about the author page comes through every step of her characters' lives zalman the patriarch who does not seem to ever falter in his belief is both unlikable and yet demonstrably empathetic he goes back to recover the remains of the dead jews hitler left behind he wants to reclaim the poor orphan boy living with the peasant woman who rescued him he is not kind to her and is relentlessly manipulative to get the boy from her is his bigotry of her excusable because of all he has suffered or that she is herself anti semitic and complicit in some ways of the war crimes she is also a contradiction she looked down on and disliked the jews as a group yet she saved josef to much danger to herself as my sister would say what do i do with that i am not sure if my eventual disenchantment with the book not total it was still a great read was influenced by the lack of happy endings for any of the characters the narrative insisted even if my own inner literary compass did not and it did that consequences were not to be avoided well not for the main characters anyway i knew the story of the escape of the satmar rebbe from the nazis this book explains the conspiracy behind it a deal made with eichmann let the rebbe out and the other jews in the area will go quietly is this true i have no idea although my guess is that the author thinks it is why else include such a heavy accusation even in a novel there were many other ways she could and did illustrate the unavoidable misogyny inherent in this fundamentalism as all the patriarchal religions inevitable must reveal the rebbe leads a long life of glory in his court in america the pious but cruel zalman suffers losses but never admits to himself that to follow his proscribed piety may not be the kind choice the nurmeberg trials and the excuse of following orders is rather clumsily inserted numerous times in juxtaposition josef the saved little boy who witnessed the murder of his biological family and his own abandonment of his adoptive mother marries for love and finds out he is infertile his wife mila finds precedent for sleeping with someone other than her husband to conceive not only does she never have more children any intimacy with her husband ever again estrangement from her granddaughter who eventually commits suicide and the premature death of her husband atara the adoptive daughter of zalman after her own parents are killed trying to catch the rebbe's train that will lead him to switzerland instead of auschwitz gets to see her mother one more time before her mother dies her father never accepts her again she is left with rueful dissatisfaction and loneliness she risks it all to be true to herself i did not see her finding spiritual redemption jewish or otherwise i wonder if that lack of closure or at least satisfaction in it is what the author feels as well can we escape who we are born to be and become who we want to be and is it worth it more","154":" all at once i am forbidden is brutally honest compelling disturbing and enlightening fundamentalist jews--especially those who exist in the modern day--are not a topic often written about nor are they widely understood yet while anouk markovits initiates the reader quite nicely into hasidic tradition and portrays her characters very well this book plot in and of itself is a bit sloppy i'm going to be quite honest and say that a lot of the ideology markovits presented in this book was horrifying this line in particular \"rabbi nachman of bratslav taught that pleasure in marriage was adultery against the lord the pious one feels pain during intercourse\" pg 213 um yeah i don't agree with that at all there's a whole book in the christian old testament devoted to sex and erotic poetry granted it was written by a man with 600 wives and 300 concubines but still it did find its way into the bible so you know...at times i struggled with what was being portrayed in i am forbidden especially since the main conflict has to do with a married couple's sexual relationship and trouble conceiving but under no circumstances did anouk markovits preach toward one perspective or another really this novel was narrated in a detached faraway sort of style and markovits's authorial presence was very much like that of a casual observer that definitely made it easier to handle what was happening without feeling like my own beliefs were being condemned or that markovits was on a soapbox against fundamentalism as i said this book did an excellent job of explaining hasidic culture to the reader the first half which set the stage for the big conflict--the actual \"forbiddenness\"--in the second half was very good there wasn't a driving plot in the beginning and everything was very focused on characters and how they lived within the lifestyle they'd been born into i found all that to be supremely fascinating however things got a little weird after two of the characters moved to the united states i hesitate to say this but the narrative took on an almost surreal quality a woman really wanting a child to please her husband runs off in the middle of a communist demonstration and has sex in a corner with a random dude while reciting hasidic prayers and ranting about tamar tamar's story is in genesis 38 that part really did not fit with what had come before--crazy lady was wholly unexpected and then the results of crazy lady's actions were rushed through in about 70 pages once again adding to the surreal feeling i had while reading anouk markovits did great in establishing her scene and characters i found but when it came to writing an actual plot she didn't do nearly so well the latter half of i am forbidden was rough and underdeveloped the conclusion was forced and stale i really loved the information and vivid detail i got about hasidic jews from this book it was very informative and unbiased i thought though i think most readers will come to the same opinion i did had i am forbidden just been a character study sort of literary novel i would have really liked this but in attempting to add a thrilling and showy plotline in i think anouk markovits set herself up for failure","155":"an excellent excellent book that follows a handful of people from the holocaust to modern day the author knows the chasidic community well since she grew up in it until she left at age 19 unlike the memoir unorthodox the scandalous rejection of my hasidic roots that i read just prior to this one the book is respectful of the chasidic culture even when it clearly isn't a good fit for some of the characters it shows some of the extreme beliefs and behaviors that some of the satmar chasids embrace but it also depicts some of the joy and benefits of the tight community very well written highly recommended","156":"it is difficult to span many generations of a family's life in a single novel the author of this book makes a valiant effort to do so but ultimately falls short certain years events are brought richly to life while others rush by with barely a glance that style didn't serve the story particularly well in short this book was not as good as i'd hoped it would be","157":"this was a fascinating book i really had a hard time putting it down and finished it over a couple of late nights","158":"i couldn't stop reading this book the characters are complicated and not always likeable but always compelling the window that this book attempts to provide into the desperate choices afforded to people within tight hasidic sects was fascinating and i enjoyed this book and being brought into that world for a few hundred pages","159":"one of the most depressing books i have ever read i kept hoping that something would go well for any of the characters i also found the writing style to be difficult at times and challenging to connect fully with the characters","160":"it is in my top ten it is the story of a sect of hasidic jews spanning from 1939 to current times starting in transylvania moving to paris and then to nyc a three generation story that makes you think very hard about how religion and tradition can destroy families when they are unable to evolve into modern times it is a wonderful story about two sisters and the different paths the chose for their lives fascinating highly recommend it","161":"i loved t and was disturbed by this book i highly recommend it what goes on behind doors and women's lack of freedom in many cultures","162":" wow this is the story of two hasidic jewish girls raised together as sisters in wwii europe this book to me was fascinating having little education information about hasidism while i don't personally agree with the views held by this religion it is historical fiction at it's best concerning this family and the agonizing choices some members have to make based on their religious practices and beliefs the author was born into and raised in a hasidic sect which lends to the utmost credibility of the book i was rivieted through most of the book","163":"i thought i wrote a review for this but i can't seem to find it i thought this was good but it was a bit too depressing to make me enjoy it at this point about a year later i can't even remember it","164":"if you want to know what it feels like to be haredi this book is for you","165":"dnf i'm not sure if it's because i was reading really late at night but i didn't feel like i was following the plot it felt complicated or disjointed maybe","166":"good story heartbreaking to see what traditions and fundamentalist beliefs can do to a family","167":"from pre wwii romania to postwar paris to williamsburg today conformity and rigid belief trump love for four generations of ultra orthodox satmar hasidim very sad","168":"spanning 50 years this story begins during the holocaust and ends in williamsburg new york it is an evocation of the satmar community an exploration of what it means to be free and a meditation on the place of love in history both personal and communal","169":"i am forbidden follows three generations of a hasidic jewish family starting in romania under the iron guard movement and finishing in the satmar hasidic community established in williamsburg new york hasidism is a strict religion rooted in the torah their day to day lives are lived based on the interpretation of this book and everything is done in such a fashion to ensure that all family members in the same blood line have a place by the messiah's side there are many activities deemed forbidden in hasidism and if someone within the religion does something out of line with the laws of the religion they become forbidden unable to marry or have any sort of life within the religion at the start of the story we are introduced to josef who was hiding when his family was killed by members of the iron guard romania's anti semitic death squad he is found by the family's gentile housemaid and she takes him in as her own five years after josef rescue he helps mila a young girl who has recently witnessed her family's death at the hand of the iron guard escape from countryside by train later zalman stern a leader in the satmar community learns of josef who is the only living son of a prominent family murdered by the iron guard and retrieves him from the woman who has taken him as her own son josef has a difficult time fitting back in to the hasidic lifestyle after being taken in by the stern family who has previously taken in mila the girl josef previously rescued mila proves to be a comfort to josef while he tries to adjust to his changed life but he is quickly sent away to live in the satmar community in williamsburg the years go by and mila continues to live with the stern family in paris being raised as a sister to their eldest daughter atara while josef is raised as a highly accomplished torah scholar atara and mila are close but atara gets a taste of books which are forbidden although mila is devoted to the religion atara decides she wants more from her life and she steals away in the middle of the night mila receives a marriage proposal from josef in america mila is thrilled by the marriage proposal and leaves paris to wed josef josef and mila are devoted to each other and i really got a strong sense of this while reading about their life together and through their attempts to have children this is where the story gets bound up in this severe religion which could be the demise of the bloodline and the families ability to go on to be with the messiah mila eventually goes on to have rachael and she proves to be a devote to the religion as her father josef when rachael's daughter judith is old enough to wed secrets are revealed that cause tragedy although i cannot imagine being involved in such a strict way of life this story is presented in such a way that i felt i connected with the satmar's way of life as if i was completely understanding of the reasoning although this is ultimately a sad story there is beauty in the love and dedication these people have for their beliefs previous to this book i had no knowledge of the iron guard i had not previously realized that romania too was involved in the holocaust this story would have received a 5 star rating had it not been for the disjointedness i felt during a couple of periods where the author skipped through time very quickly if you are interested in understanding more about hasidism this is an excellent choice","170":"what an interesting way to learn about the jewish orthodox faith this novel explained many things that customs i heard about but never new the reason for them if you want to know why women wear wigs or the orthodox can't touch objects on the sabbath this book is for you","171":" i loved this book it is extremely rare that i rate a book with 5 stars this book touched me deeply although i did not grow up in hasidish background i was raised orthodox and i feel the author did an amazing job describing the demands and love and religious commitment extracted by those involved essentially it is fair to say that the story revolves around each character reconciling their desires with the commandments they follow i highly recommend this book once i started reading this i was paralyzed to do anything but finish reading this book extremely well written","172":"an extremely touching book on the fate of three jewish children who had survived persecution during wwii in transylvania the story spans across the post war refuge in paris and how their strict religious upbringing keeps them into a world of their own what matters is that the girls once they are of age are married and eventually there is the expectation to provide children however life often takes care of itself and blind religious faith can easily lead to a life less searched less lived and a complete prison of its own aspiration and happiness that may descend into unprecedented sadness the emotions lived via the characters are poignant and book can be heavy to an extent i found that the author could also keep up with the development of other characters in addition for those non familiar with the jewish religion and traditions many parts of the book can lose their relevance having said that the complexity of the characters is very much vivid throughout the book above all the reader comes to the realisation that often blinded unquestioning love is not enough and extreme religious faith can become somewhat very tough in compromising to the joys demands that life often puts us through","173":"it was very hard for me to separate my own feelings on the subjects described from my appraisal of this book while i understood it i simply could not accept the prejudices described to be any kind of good religios practice the story is well told i guess i simply didn't like the characters or the closure of the story","174":"what an interesting read this made me think a lot about holding onto beliefs that go against our gut and our heart and how that affects those around us i would recommend this anyone","175":" those who read the chosen will find some similarities here there's a scholar prodigy gematria questioning of long held beliefs and the transition of a hasidic group from eastern europe to america however here the author a better knowledge and understanding about hassidism and judaism than i suspect most people will have for example hasids originally opposed the formation of the state of israel and were anti zionism that's not so say there isn't some explanation eg complete immersion three times in the mikvah cleanses your soul or jewish beliefs in what happens after death but i'm not sure it's enough the conflict with the beliefs that sends atara away from her family is shown but in a weird way we see her reading forbidden books questioning midrash and commentart hearing that she might have an arranged marriage and leaving home but there's nothing abouther for the next nearly 100 pages and 47 years how mila and atara's family deal with her absence is only revealed in the last 30 pages it's also within those last 30 pages that all the major plot twist gets resolved but in such a way that readers might be confused as to the religious issues those in the nyc area with the satmar populations of williamsburg kirias joel and monsey nearby will find this an interesting look into that closed world the dynastic issues are not covered as this book focuses mostly on the world of the women arc provided by publisher","176":"reading this i felt torn between awe for such dedication and horror at the foolhardiness but mostly i was moved along by the smooth flow and beautiful settings well rendered","177":" mila is rescued at a very early age after her parents are shot dead while trying to jump on a train escaping from the eastern european cleansing she is taken to the local rabbi who adopts her as his own she becomes sister to atara the rabbi's own daughter as the two grow atara finds herself disenchanted with her hasidic heritage she finally runs away to become her own person mila on the other hand finds comfort in her faith and is happy in the arranged marriage eventually even her comfortable marriage is put in jeopardy by mila's own actions will mila be able to justify her behavior to the rest of the family or will they all pay the price","178":"read my full review of this book on my blog summer reading project at i am forbidden by anouk markovits","179":"satmar community is very interesting to know about book is pretty poorly written however","180":" this book proves that in any religion there are extremists that take generic 'holy' text and follow it to the letter without thinking of decency to their fellow human beings i found this book so disturbing not only because it is a sect of my own religion but because this really isn't a work of fiction this is real life to those believers and i am all for freedom of religion but those that take their beliefs over the top and it affects children that's when i say enough i have never understood how a person could love their religion more than their own child a parent that would disown their own child certainly does not have my respect although this was very extreme i also grew up in a household where utmost importance was placed on religion and marrying within that religion maybe that was why this book bothered me so because i saw shades of my dad within just not so over the top the book held my interest throughout and i probably should have given it a four for storyline i just wasn't crazy about the way it was written it didn't flow for me","181":" such a good start poetic wrenching vivid depictions of death and survival among the szatmar hasidim during world war ii i was very engaged by the loving respectful descriptions of that way of life with all the sense of imprisonment and or security it entails but markovits made a peculiar decision to follow the story of the obedient not entirely that's the twist sister rather than that of the rebel after a while there's a great deal of repetition characters' behavior seems unbelievable and what you might think significant moments are elided finally what had seemed poetic begins to feel a little pat","182":"well written historically accurate","183":"i think this book actually suffers from being too condensed and spare","184":"distressing 1st hundred pages very strong writing but in the end seems contrived","185":"an interesting story of a satmar family from its roots in eastern europe to its settlement in the united states i think this book would be difficult to understand for readers not familiar with ultra orthodox judaism although there is a glossary in the back to help with hebrew and yiddish words","186":"i like reading books about other lifestyles religion and i enjoyed that about this book not my favorite but a good storyline and a pretty easy read heartbreaking though","187":" this is the story of one family of satmar jews the most religious sect of the ultra religious hasidim the story starts in transylvania in 1944 spends time in paris and ends in williamsburg brooklyn in the present time because the author lived the first part of her life in the paris satmar community and left to live a life of her own choices she knows her subject well but she also writes beautifully the characters are all believable and the plot moves smartly along it is mainly the story of two girls one an orphan who grow up in the same family but part ways when one obediently marries the man chosen for her and the other is disowned when she leaves her family to make her own life choices then the married one makes a choice she knows is a sin and the story continues with how that choice affects all the generations of the family you don't have to be jewish to enjoy this book but some things might be more familiar if you are it would be a good book club book and an excellent one if the members are all jewish but of different intensity","188":"i couldn't put the book down devoured it in three sittings over a weekend","189":" this is quite a book u0026amp to be honest i'm almost at a loss as to what to say about as i was quite overwhelmed by the story it had me in tears in a few places it takes you deep into the life of a family living in a hasidic community i have read novels about jewish families before but as i've learned there are different sects within most religions and the hasidic jews seem to be very strict in their beliefs traditions customs and most importantly rules i found it fascinating to read of lives so very different than mine it's not an easy read it requires your full attention but it is well worth reading","190":"a fascinating look into the inside of a very unique community i am impressed by the author who came from the same religious background only to reject it and leave her family the fact that she has enough distance and perspective to use her own experience to create this excellent novel is testament to her writing skill","191":"a tragedy reminds me of cutting for stone but far more eloquent","192":"it seemed like i waited forevah for something to actually happen in this story when things finally started to roll it stalled again the writing seemed random i didn't care for main characters to completely drop out of the story until many yrs later what i did appreciate was the history lesson i received on jewish leaders betraying their followers i had no idea","193":"this book while hard to put down was really a downer i had read another book recently unorthodox non fiction by a woman who had broken with the satmar group of hassidic jews in brooklyn it was fascinating but nowhere near as depressing as this current work of fiction i suspect that this book i am forbidden reflected the bitterness of the author toward her childhood in the sect","194":"a facinating glimpse into the fanatical satmar branch of hasidic jews during and after the nazi occupation","195":" this book is about a five year old boy by the name of josef who witnesses the murder of his parents by the romanian iron guard he is rescued by a gentile women and five years later he saves a young girl named mila and helps her reach zalman stern who is a satmar hasidic rabbi she is raised with his other daughter atara mila does not question the laws of g d that she is taught by the rabbi but his daughter atara questions the laws of g d she wants to study all aspects of life not just the hasidic laws this put her in conflict with her father who is considered a great rabbi we have here a great story of two women one who does not question and one who is always looking for answers to life she wants more that a marriage and to raise a family we see a great insight into the way the hasidic community lives the rules and laws that governed them the book is a very fast read it is a great story and in some parts of the book you will find quite disturbing and you will also find great joy do not past it up","196":"i am flooded with emotion after finishing this book a brilliant sharp insight into the depths of being part of a religious sect so misunderstood written with beauty shame understanding bravery a story within a story among four generations where time has stood still cried for each character the horror joy goodness cruelty and the inability to change with time thank you for writing this book","197":"i like the writing style of short poignant scenes","198":"religion and spirituality are not the same thing religion especially the traditions practices and the dogma of the people of the book demands that life be lived from the outside in by contrast true spiritually allows for life to be lived from the inside out in this way the path of what is best and highest in us is permitted to flow from within us out to the world that we inhabit religion is valuable for it establishes for us a framework in which to reside to shelter us from much that can derail us unfortunately when we align ourselves within this framework without making ourselves as knowledgeable as we are able to understand either the path that we have chosen or the life we were born into we inadvertently call suffering to us sadness such sadness but in the midst of this story is an incomparable lesson of value that must be embraced by all","199":"superbly written a moving horrific story of survival that takes place between 1939 and 2012 there are always choices to make in life and this book demonstrates how the characters make those choices some remain ultra orthodox and others leave the satmar sect they all must live and die with the consequences of their choice","200":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book because of my interest in orthodox jewish communities the writing style also really suited the subject","201":"well written well researched heart achingly sad","202":"i think this is a great book there is one critical piece of plot i found unbelievable so gave it four stars instead of five i found this to be a compelling read and just had to finish it quickly non jews or those who have no understanding of a very orthodox culture might miss a lot in this book but i found the conflicts of faith and freedom the challenges of observance and common sense the characters and their personalities the history and all its drama of what really happened and what might have all of it to be well thought out and carefully written i am looking forward to anouk markovits' next book","203":"beautifully written but unbearably sad window into hasidic life","204":"having trouble putting this one down do i really have to go to work today finished it today didn't stay at work long great book and i learned so much","205":" i read this because a new author friend of mine was reading it too that author wrote a memoir of her time as a hasidid orthodox jew living in the williamsburg neighborhood of new york that is for orthodox jews this book helped that book make even more sense as this is the story of how that division of orthodox ended up in new york in the first place they are known as satmar jews and that is an americanized version of the place in transylvania that the come from while this is a historical fiction it is a great insight to the faith itself and includes a cue angelic choir a glossary of terms for those who need it well done and well written","206":" this is a beautifully written book even though the plot is complex and detail laden it flies by it's the story of two girls raised as sisters in a satmar hasidic community who choose separate paths in adolescence one chooses a secular life the other remains bound to religious tradition the surprising and moving thing about this novel is the author's obvious affection and sympathy for those religious traditions especially considering that she herself chose to leave the hasidic community in which she was raised in order to avoid an arranged marriage","207":"fascinating look inside ultra orthodox jewish life and traditions from escaping the genocides in eastern europe to life in new york great story compelling characters","208":"i thought that this novel was very well written in many ways the novel spans decades beginning in what was once transylvania and ends in contemporary williamsburg brooklyn the novel revolves around one family the stern family and their world in the very insular hasidic jewish sect known as satmar the beginning of the novel is quite gruesome and sad and sets the tone for the rest of the novel it begins with the murder of a josef's family and his rescue by a gentile woman who passes him off as a christian five years later josef later rescues mila whose parents are also violently killed as they attempt to flee the nazis they both end up under the care of zalman stern a very pious satmar rabbi who believes in raising his family in accordance to the laws of god he raises mila as his own alongside his children and sends josef to america to study in a yeshiva under the threat of communism the stern family eventually relocates to paris just before eastern europe gets blocked off while in paris the family struggles to maintain their carefully ordered world under control and atara zalman's eldest daughter begins to immerse herself in the world of books and she questions the ruling of the rebbe the leader of their sect and her place in her religion the two girls grow up to make different choices and the book follows the life of mila and her choices and life within her community i found this book to be very educational it takes you into a world that is very private and teaches you so much about its history and its customs their is a lengthy passage regarding marriage consummation rituals that correlate with conception as well the beliefs of this sect and their rituals are also narrated within the book i have of course seen hasidic jews before but i have never known anything about them besides how they dress and that they are a sect of judaism i assumed they kept with many of the same holidays and customs as other jewish people i know but i wasn't aware of how they performed their rituals and just how private they are i also didn't know that many of them have anti zionist beliefs which i thought was very interesting what i liked about this book was the writing it was very clear and beautiful and does a great job of keeping you interested the book is very dark but it doesn't make you feel depressed while reading it in fact it makes you intrigued and hopeful hopeful in the sense that you want to best for these characters and you want them to find peace and happiness what i would have liked more of was atara's life since markovits' focus was to follow mila's life inside her community she neglected atara's life i thought it would have been nice to see atara's life and how she handled the choices she made overall a very great read","209":"this book was fascinating well written and provided an enjoyable glimpse into the world of satmar hadisim i must say that the second half of the book was incredibly sad and i felt that the book didn't deliver on what it promised with the first part of itself but now as i consider it i appreciate the way in which the deeply held beliefs sort of tore the family apart this book has made me think about it after i've finished reading it that's always a great thing for a book to do","210":"it is a book that gives a vivid picture into the lives of the hasidics i found it very interesting though some of the premises were not believable","211":" this book is powerful i felt like i was making a spiritual journey the destination depended upon what character i was identifying with at the moment i loved the way the book barreled through time stopping at a telling juncture in a character's life but never telling you enough or the whole story in the beginning i found the holocaust scenes harrowing since the deaths were so particularly cruel mercifully the actual killing was pretty quick but the effects were felt for generations the window into the minds and hearts of the ultra orthodox was enlightening i am following the stories about the sexual abuse cases being reported and also the problems in israel about compulsory military service the prose is beautiful and i wish i hadn't read it so quickly i just could' t stop once i got through the first two chapters it will make awonderful audio book","212":"oops missed the yiddish glossary in the back and i really could have used it","213":"an interesting read about generations of one hasidic family in transylvania beginning in 1944 and ending in 2005 in manhattan","214":"this is a troubling and puzzling look into the strict taboos and laws of life within the ultra orthodox hasidic community in new york city and in europe two sisters follow different courses in their approach to the religious community but it both are deeply scarred by the rigidity of the faith and the tenets of excluding outsiders and keeping women as producers of children but of little other value interesting in its glimpse into this closed society but disturbing as well","215":"one of the best books i have read in a long time it made me think it opened me to new perspectives in addition the writing elevated my appreciation for the act of creativity in print","216":"really captivating look into the hidden lives of satmar hasidim an ultra orthodox sect in judaism the reader is drawn into a world built on rabbinic laws of moral ritual and family purity it is a family history that begins in nazi occupation of transylvania continues to post war paris and from there to contemporary hasidic williamsburg in contemporary times the central struggle of the book has to do with the burden of continuing jewish heritage through having children i really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the daily lives of strictly religious groups","217":"very thought provoking","218":"i really enjoyed the first half of this story but the second seemed forced and i did not enjoy it as much i just didnt understand the characters' motivations i did enjoy the poetic beauty of the writing it is well worth reading if you enjoy good writing","219":"i am always a little bit fascinated with the satmar sect of orthodox judaism i wish the plot had been a little more intriguing","220":"i enjoyed this book but midway the writing seemed confusing then it got clearer again it was almost as it it was edited or written separately the story is intriguing worth the time","221":"i don't know a lot about hasidic life but i found this book very compelling it follows the story of several people through a generation how their lives interact and how their interactions affect others it really makes you think about how life would be in such a strict religion and how sometimes the faith involved in those beliefs might be worth questioning","222":"this novel tells the story of two women growing up in a satmar hasidic family and the divergent paths their lives take the author left her sect when she was 19 so there may be some autobiographical elements to the story","223":" i had higher expectations for this book thinking i would learn a great deal about fundamental jewish living while reading a good story i did learn some about life in a satmar home how the men study and the women are so protected how life and sex are so prescribed that was interesting but i hoped to learn much more about how the orthodox function within society the writing was basic and in often very short paragraphs and snippets of a scene then there would be an expanse of white and then another snippet rather like dan brown has written the book i didn't relish this story starts off in transylvania in the time of wwii moves to paris and to america with the marriage of a protagonist and her childhood friend they have ten years of infertility which is not admired in a satmar community and then she gets pregnant by a stranger on a trip to paris in 1968 and then their marriage falls apart since the guy has just ascertained that is in incapable of fathering a child the book just didn't appeal the writing was too simple dialogue too basic","224":"book club selection","225":"slow beginning but fascinating story note to other readers there is a glossary in the back to help you with all the vocabulary i didn't find it until i got to the end of the book","226":"can't stop thinking about this one it was so good not sure the appeal would be as great if you don t know some of the jewish law would love to discuss","227":"this book has a surprise ending it is fascinating how she takes a true event rabbi joel teitelbaum's train of 1700 jews was saved from bergen belsen it makes you think about what sacrifices are worth living for and when you should keep your mouth shut the protagonist has one idea of doing what it takes to survive and her husband and grandchildren take the opposite tack i recommend this book to everyone what does it mean to survive to thrive what does it mean to fit into the community","228":"very interesting read","229":"i probably made a mistake reading this right after finishing unorthodox by deborah feldman which is a memoir written by a woman who was raised in the satmar hasidic sect in brooklyn ny going from undiluted non fiction to this poetic slightly navel gazing fictional novel admittedly colored my impressions in many places the story is difficult to follow and murky there are periods of intense action then blank spots filled with vague descriptions of the goings on of numerous characters it's frustrating to say the least i finished the book with a sense of utter incompleteness too much is left unresolved unexplained too much of what would otherwise be a phenomenal story is left to vague meandering semi paragraphs i'll set this one aside for a few years and revisit it next time without reading the much better non fiction book beforehand with that said it is a good story but if you want a clearer story more details and better characterization i suggest deborah feldman's best selling memoir unorthodox","230":"a story of hasidic jews who go through the shoah and some to america williamsburg the characters are gripping and love and loss is throughout including atara who rejects the life of orthodoxy the ultimate fate of the main characters did seem unlikely but at the reading was believable","231":"interesting story told through the generations of a family of satmar hasidic jews somewhat hard to follow at times but beautifully written and very sad","232":"i am forbidden by anouk markovits is a richly complex look into the lives of four generations of family members within the satmar sect a faction of judaism i was completely unaware of making i am forbidden all that more intriguing a book markovits deftly weaves together the lives of her characters what it means to live within the satmar sect as well as the consequences if the rules are not strictly adhered to my reasoning for giving this beautifully written book four stars rather than five is because i would have preferred to have the sections longer i felt as though there was so much more to be explored that said markovits characters and writing style are exceptional and i look forward to reading more by this author disclaimer i received a copy of i am forbidden through the amazon vine program for review","233":"a tragic account of the effects of extreme religious beliefs the novel chronicles the lives of a family within an insular sect of hasidic judaism the family lives by extreme rules of their faith that dictate their every move the story focuses on the lives of two women one with a deep faith and another who chooses to turn away from her faith these women are sisters although one is adopted during the holocaust it was excruciating to watch how difficult it was for both of these woman to be true to themselves and to the lives they had chosen additionally the author writes as though every reader will understand her religious phrasing and geographical references which isn't the case and therefore makes parts of the book annoying furthermore i felt that the characters were not as well developed as they could be which left me filling in my own blanks with conjecture overall i didn't really enjoy this book even though i love reading about history culture and religion","234":"i fell into it and read it in almost one sitting","235":"i loved this book because i learned a great deal from it i highly recommend it","236":"the book finally got interesting about 3 4 in was worth the read for those last pages","237":"this was very interesting i knew little about this audiobook was outstanding","238":"i listened to the audiobook version beautifully read by rosalyn landor i would give this 3 5 stars as i found the first half very compelling and the second half less so","239":" this is a novel of two young women who belong to the hasidic sect of the jewish religion and the choices they make in life it begins in the countryside of romania in 1939 when two children josef and mila are orphaned when each of their families are murdered mila goes to paris to live in the home of zalman stern and forms a bond with his daughter atara as they mature atara feels trapped by the restraints of jewish fundamentalism while mila embraces it they each take different roads in life","240":" i really wasn't expecting that ending not at all wow anouk has a very elegant writing style really rich and powerful at the same time members of a hassidic family in romenia need to live in torn between the religious law and their own desires starting around the wwii two hassidic orphans josef and mila are taken in by zalman stern and their lives start to follow different paths after a few years josef goes to united states to study and mila goes to paris with the family where she becomes heavilly attached to atara zalman's oldest daughter due to the turbulence of their lives in a foreign country the family learn that everything is changing in the world including their own jewish community and it is in the middle of those changes that atara develops a certain need of discovering more than the things her family can and will provide to her mila and atara become the opposite sides of the same coin and anouk uses their stories to develop the cultural and social changes of the previous century there is only one word to describe the way anouk develops the story heartbreaking the books follows a narrative in which a few characters come and go whenever its necessary this might be a little awkward in the beginning but after a while you get used to it and discover that those changes were for the best every little thing in the book has a deep meaning including the pearls in the cover and those things were so majestically in the narrative that you become a part of the story watching everything so closely that you can almost touch it great and heavy book","241":"i found this book a little confusing at times i thought it was okay though it dragged towards the end but it started out well","242":"fascinating but disturbed me the ending was not what i wanted but i couldn't put the book down","243":" i am forbidden begins in romania in the 1930's when being jewish was not a safe thing to be young josef sees his parents murdered by the iron guard his childhood friend mila is also tragically separated from her parents josef helps mila find safety with zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in whose home mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara josef himself spends several years being raised by a non jewish woman who risked everything to protect him as this beautiful story begins it's weave we see mila u0026amp atara's sisterhood friendship blossom and then strain causing eventual separation mila marries a devout hasidic man who brings her to williamsburg brooklyn to begin their lives together tradition u0026amp religion dictate every decision the married couple makes until a reckless decision in a moment of utter desperation creates generations of consequences wow what a story it is so beautifully written moving from character to character so seamlessly the more i read the less i wanted to stop reading i was also deeply fascinated by the life of the hasidic jewish community being raise christian i know the basic roots of the jewish faith but never fully comprehended their lifestyle until this book this story spans generations u0026amp continents family abandonment u0026amp reconciliation and faith u0026amp unbelief i hope others will discover this delightful disturbing beautiful and sorrowful read","244":" i chose to read anouk markovits' i am forbidden because of the blurb about the writer on the back inside flap i am fascinated by stories of people who belong to fundamentalist religious sects which religion is not relevant and who leave those sects because it seems they are more taken with the inclusive world of literature than with intense study of their own religious sect markovits grew up in france as part of the ultra religious satmar sect of judaism she left that community at the age of nineteen to avoid an arranged marriage since that time she earned a bachelor's from columbia a master's in architecture from harvard and a doctorate in romance studies from cornell she currently lives in nyc i am forbidden is her second novel her first in english this novel is a beautifully written her first in english story of two young women who are brought up as sisters in a satmar family living in france one is the biological daughter of the family the other is the daughter of the father's yeshiva study partner she is the only one of the family to survive an attack by the nazis knowing the biography of the author i was expecting something like the story in chaim potok's the chosen the biological daughter would leave the ultraorthodox community for the secular world while the adopted daughter would remain a member of the satmar community i couldn't wait to hear how the details of how the biological daughter transitions from ultraorthodox to secular values and lifestyle was i ever surprised the book chooses a different path and takes the reader into unexpected worlds i was spellbound for the last third of the novel traveling through an unfamiliar landscape while immersed in the most lyrical language this is a book worth rereading worth owning even though i read a library copy and i will look for this author's future books i would try her first pur coton but my french is not up to the task","245":"this powerful story offers a unique vision inside the homes of multi generational hasidic families that live through the horrors of war and the difficulties of peace in many countries it is written with great skill taste proportion subtle poetic prose and deep knowledge of its subject as the author anouk markovits was raised in france in a satmar house she left her home at the age of 19 when a marriage was arranged for her she holds three degrees in three different subjects from three u s universities but with this book she has come into her own as a major modern author the story follows the lives of two sisters one adopted by a rabbi in transylvania when her parents are killed by the nazis and the other the rabbi's natural daughter atara it is ironic that the sister who decides to strictly adhere to the life of hasidic faith is the adopted child atara is the one that flees the story is evocatively told and i read it at one reading something i seldom do because it was so fascinating and the excellency of the writing was so admirable i gained such an insight as well into a religion i knew very little about at heart it is a story of the conflict between divine law as it is perceived and immediate love as it is experienced this is dr markovits's first book written in english there is one that precedes it pur coton written in french hopefully an english translation will be forthcoming","246":"very interesting view of hasidic jewish culture ending seemed a bit rushed 34 years passed by in a couple of pages plot wise it works but it seems like the pacing was off compared to the rest of the novel","247":"i now only have vague memories of anouk markovits speaking of her novel when it was new though i wrote about her appearance at the 2012 dc jewish literary festival on my blog jewishdc in part she wanted to explore the secrets and close mindedness of the satmar hassidic community she does this in a poetic sympathetic matter so that she is not preachy or biased one of the characters atara is more like markovits in that she decides to leave the community but after she does so the narrative mostly sticks with her adoptive sister mila who remains within that world although she has struggles in her life to which her interpretation of judaism appears to only add more pain she never considers leaving the satmar are not just some vaguely defined ultra religious sect they have roots in a town in transylvania from which they were expunged during the holocaust and then they re establish themselves in brooklyn ny as a microcosm the orphans mila and josef who later marry feel bound to and a sense of purpose in their communal religious doctrine as a way to find meaning in the murders of their families they and atara also grapple in very different ways when they witness a factual event of how their leader the satmar rebbe turned to hypocritical and arguably inhumane methods to survive the nazis the novel does not take sides and i commend it for that the pacing is a little uneven and barrels forward like a life's summary after the forbidden event in the late '60s i get why mila turned so desperately to the biblical story of tamar but i don't get why she decided to join the parisian protestors for a day seemed a bit convenient in a novel where markovits got to probe so much history anyway there's a whole lot about central europe ending with the communism that drove our main characters out and literally sealed the border on them i did love her descriptive prose about parisian streets she doesn't spoon feed her audience anything including yiddishisms and religious practice leading to an occasional set of brackets but i imagine the general non jewishly inclined reader might be confused even with the glossary in the back the ending is somewhat of a sad little circle both for the macro story of the jewish satmar experience in central europe and also with mila's personal story i appreciated that but perhaps it's the novel's lack of moralizing that makes me feel unsettled the satmar hassids believe in following religious laws for an ordered and righteous life but history and people don't find that so easily in the book","248":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits i enjoyed the novel up til the last couple sections i thought that the writing style of the author was unique which is what drew me to in the first place it read like a film which kept my interest through out the novel it changes perspective which i liked but i became to like atara's character and story more so than the others and so i was disappoint when the story shifted away from hers overall i would give it three stars it was good but i probably wouldn't read it again","249":"i was slightly annoyed with this book because it used so many hasidic judaic terms that i sometimes couldn't follow the context or thought process since i don't really know a whole lot about this sect of judaism it was somewhat interesting i think the only reason i finished it was because it was written in short sections","250":"this book is a fascinating look inside the lives of one family of satmar jews and how the constraints of religious law impact them starting during world war ii and right up to present day i enjoyed it immensely","251":"the writing and the newness of the book take a little while to get used to it is a tale from inside a strict religious jewish culture from wwii in eastern europe to modern day america and follows four generations of a family there are secrets that risk tearing apart the fabric of this group what one young child saw during wwii a daughter's reading books and her questions about g d and the danger of making a pregnancy the most important part of a woman's life it was poignant tale dealing with the questions that g d cannot answer in the life of a woman","252":"sad but interesting fictional story of women's roles in satmar jewish society","253":"read it quickly and was more than disappointed i wanted to learn about hasidic life and while the characters were indeed ultra orthodox their story was horrific begins with children watching while nazis slaughter their families then more anxiety and suffering until they grow up and marry followed by adultery with more angst and despair and then spoiler alert the grand finale of two suicides sure the writing was excellent which only made this book more nightmare producing imho i can read plenty of terrible things everyday in the news so when i read fiction i want to be uplifted not depressed life is too short to read novels that don't giive me a happy or at least satisfying ending","254":" i finished this book days ago and am still giving it a ponder when i was a senior in high school my english teacher required that we read jane eyre and keep a reading journal the journal was for us to write reflections as we read i used it mainly to write down words from je that i wanted to look up the definition for and then never got around to doing and for writing insightful comments like brocklehurst is a poophead i hadn't given serious thought to keeping a reading journal for any book until i read i am forbidden this book practically begs for a book club for reading slowly so that you can savor each word for talking about it with someone as soon as you finish the last page as i read i kept remembering the line from angels in america catholics believe in forgiveness jews believe in guilt that's certainly not to say that jewish people have a monopoly on guilt i think that was another aia line because they most definitely do not i don't think i've ever read a book where so many characters were intent on living joyless lives and so skilled in manipulating others especially kids through guilt it was pretty creepy and nauseating and infuriating as an added and cheerful bonus i don't think that i've ever read a book where going to a public library was so deliciously naughty for serious you know when the characters are beginning on their dark paths because they go to the library to do research oooooo it made me gleeful and proud","255":" i am forbidden cannot decide what story it wants to tell is it the story of josef lichtenstein whose parents are murdered by the romanian iron guards and who is saved by his christian maid is it mila whose parents are killed just a few years later or atara raised in a hasidic family who chafes under the strict rules of her religious upbringing ultimately the stories come together but not in a satisfying manner too much time is skipped over and the reader has no emotional investment several generations down the line it's too bad because i was intrigued by the promise of a glimpse inside the hasidic community","256":"loved this book brutal deep heart wrenching and fascinating loved the history and loved the characters if you want to learn about another culture this is a fantastic read","257":"while the story centers on life inside the insular satmar hasidic community the themes of this beautiful story can be much appreciated by anyone raised within certain cultural religious confines to those raised in more secular circles this story might read exotic markovits' descriptive talents paint a world any reader could get lost in i was not enthralled by the story itself which i felt played itself out quite predictably rather i found myself completely absorbed in the beauty of the writing so many beautifully crafted sentences each evoking their own unique world i stopped for moments at a time and allowed myself to be taken away to these worlds one after the other as i writer i was envious at times and felt it would do me good to study markovits' writing and learn all i could from it not an easy read that said i read it in a day and a half","258":" anouk tells the story of two sisters who grew up in an ultra orthodox jewish family zalman stern is the patriarch of this family and is very strict about following every edict of the satmar hasidic sect i was surprised to learn about how restrictive some of the customs are once a girl comes of age she is not allowed any secular study one of the sisters is very eager to learn more about the world and hence has to leave home and is renounced by her family the story begins in szatmar transylvania moves on to paris and then finally ends in williamsburg brooklyn where the hasidic sect has resettled after being destroyed in the holocaust the novel is fast paced and anouk tells a good story filled with page turning drama if you are curious about learning more about orthodox jews and some of their customs and rituals this book is both educative and entertaining","259":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was an eye opener into the world of the satmar community i thought that it was very interesting and informative","260":" i am forbidden is the story of two hasidic jewish girls raised together as sisters in wwii europe mila made an orphan by the atrocities committed against her people in that war is delivered to atara's family by another war made orphan josef a hasidic jew being hidden by a christian woman as the years pass mila's faith intensifies in part because she hopes it will lead to her reunification with her parents she and josef find their way to each other again and marry in those same years atara's faith falters despite her intense bond with mila and the girls' relationship is broken a secret eventually returns them to each other the persecution of jews during wwii and the hasidism figure prominently in the novel and the reader learns quite a bit throughout its course about hasidism in particular as it is an insular community about which most readers will given its insular nature know rather little the author was born into and raised in a hasidic sect the reason i think the novel succeeds so well is that though its conflicts are situated in a particular time among a particular group of people the questions it is exploring are universal when we find ourselves trying to fend off or recover from the worst of life's cruelties and blows what will sustain and heal us what do we do when those things are in conflict i am forbidden is a thoughtful historical novel written by a seemingly knowledgeable and sensitive author it was a pleasure to be in the world she created even if it offered no easy answers to the questions it presented","261":"this is a beautiful but horribly sad story there is never really any talking between husband and wife and there is never real explanations for people so that there are moments of desperation on both parts the things that is most devastating throughout the book is that there is no forgiveness and no redemption","262":" i received this book from the goodreads first reads program i feel really bad that i didn't pick this book up sooner stupid grad school seeing as this is an incredibly quick read and draws you into the story right from the get go i've always had an interest in non mainstream religions i mean this very neutrally no offense intended i believe on the whole that markovits did a splendid job painting a picture of satmar homes across generations intimate details about satmar family life and the trials and tribulations that every human being has to go through regardless of age gender religion race etc i would have given this five stars but i feel like i got lost in the plot line once or twice and that markovits strayed unintentionally away from the plot overall though i'm very glad to have read this","263":"i loved the historical background the first two thirds were great then it slowed down and i wasn't a fan of the end disappointing because the buildup was fantastic then it just fizzled i would have loved more insight to the satmar culture as well as the author was raised in the religion well written though and it kept me turning the pages","264":"i liked this book so much i was able to deal with the very heart wrenching ending i usually hate sad endings but in this book it was an important part of understanding the story","265":"loved i loved the characters and the trials they faced in the lives they chose to lead i don't know much about hasidic jews and the descriptions both of daily life and of the greater issues facing this community were fascinating i imagine a whole series of books springing from these characters the events are so rich almost everyone we met could have a book of their own","266":" this book is a journey into a religion and culture that i cannot even pretend to understand the jewish fundamentalist community the satmar is incredibly insular and while one must respect these people it is easy to find fault in their ways the author was herself a member of the satmar community until she left and became ostracized from her family and community the novel explores the ways of this community as well as the very personal lives of several members it is especially hard to be a woman as women have no voice or no real role other then to support their spouse and have lots of babies this is a very hard wrenching read","267":"the writing was too stylized and disjointed for me","268":"this book threw me into a world i knew next to nothing about and showed me a new perspective with empathy which is part of what i'm looking for in a book heartbreaking and beautiful","269":"read anouk markovits i am forbidden is an enthralling tale deep into the lives of two hasidic read more here http wp me p2sn2i fp","270":" after six months of this books sitting on my shelf i finally got around to reading it and i thought it was ok i found the cultural context very interesting but i thought that markovits' way of writing was vague and confusing sometimes i had no idea what was actually going on and i felt as though she wrote the historical and some of the cultural allusions for someone who has a foreknowledge of the subject i e the jewish community their leaders and the persecution that happened in places other than germany and poland even though i liked the plot the incomprehensible prose threw me off still the story was actually very good especially the cultural references the novel follows the narration of five different characters with interconnected lives zalman stern a strictly orthodox jew who adopts mila the second narrator mila follows in her adopted father's footsteps when it comes to her religion but when she finds out the truth about her parent's death she struggles to understand her place in the fold mila marries josef a young orphan who is also strictly orthodox after ten years of barren marriage both mila and josef make choices that go against the command of their all holy rebbe and their religion in the background of this is atara zalman stern's birth daughter but after she questions the faith and leaves the community she becomes dead to him her friendship with mila however plays a large role in josef and mila's relationship as well as that of their granddaughter judith who is the final narrator when judith finds out the secrets her grandparents have kept for fifty years it makes her question the life she has always understood as the truth after that long winded explanation i have to say that the plot was very good but poorly executed although the characters of atara and mila and zalman were developed particularly well the rest of the characters seemed flat i felt as though markovits didn't follow the characters through and it showed by the chaotic writing and scattered plotting all together an interesting concept but not followed through to create a complete novel","271":"a great story about satmar hasidim i learn a lot well writen book could not put down","272":"although i read it in less than 36 hours i didn't love it it was an interesting look into an extremist culture that i am thankful i am not a part of and it was pretty slow at first","273":"the beginning was good not great but then it takes an interesting turn the last 3rd of the book was excellent","274":"i have always been intrigued by stories about the hasidic community the proscribed laws seemed to be for good reason practical in many ways and people knew what to expect from their lives family was paramount the most important part of your life after following god's commandments it seemed to me that it would be comforting to know where you stood what to do and that you would always have friends sisters brothers and others in the community to consort with this book on the other hand exposes how limiting the laws are if everything in your life flows along at a good pace and you are happy with your spouse it would likely be a good life but the first time you question anything you are asked to do or vere from the expected the laws would work against you you would either have to continue on your way following the law but be unhappy about it or if you didn't comply with the law you would be banned from the community and never see your loved ones again it shows that life is not neat and tidy something that you can follow and be happy in each day when any diversion in the way you decided to live would become known you would be an emotional wreck the community would turn against you and like it or not you would find yourself living in a foreign universe","275":"one very dysfunctional family it does not matter if they are jewish catholic or other they have major issues","276":"struggling with this book narrative is not coherent and the motivation of the characters does not always make sense especially mila not sure if i will make to the end","277":"this was a fascinating look into a different culture very informative with well formed characters that i found myself rooting for and getting attached to i would definitely recommend reading this one","278":"story about a hasidic jew 1944 1990","279":" well i started with no real understanding of hassidic jews or jewish people in general and so had no clue what this book would be like it was very well done i really didnt miss anything by not having any previous background the story was clear and a bit long but focused on the lives of two individuals the middle got me a bit confused as while there is a lot of time jumping starting at young children and ending at the end of their lives but the middle seemed to jump very quickly and i felt i missed something i hate spoilers so am not gonna tell you where it was totally a book i would recommend to others especially if they are interested in religious books","280":"deep dark moving tales of very different world across three generations good writing left me feeling me feeling down around the fates of the characters","281":"good book hard to follow","282":"i loved most of this book but found the ending so rushed i couldn't honestly give it a five much of this story was beautiful even in it's darkest moments certainly do recommend it just be prepared for a two generation jump for the last fifth of the book","283":"this is an emotional tale of two sisters growing up in a strict religious home my only complaint is that i wish the glossary could have included more of the foreign words and phrases used because i did have a hard time making sense of some of things that i was unfamiliar with overall this book was great","284":"darkness grips eastern europe in the 1940s as war devours millions and the hopes of generations jewish residents of romania are especially hard pressed already viewing themselves as a people in exile they are dispersed further afield as they flee persecution i am forbidden follows the family of a jewish scholar who rescues two orphans and raises them with his own children first in paris and then in england sadly not only war threatens their peace as two daughters growing up in an archly traditional sect of judaism struggle to find their role within it i am forbidden is a heartbreaking story of lives ruined by secrets and scrupulosity of hardened hearts sinking any hopes for happiness in using the coming of age of two friends here sisters to explore the tensions between hasidim and modernity i am forbidden is rather like the chosen but where the latter offered a hopeful conclusion this leaves the reader in despair there is interest here of course the insight given here about hasidism but the utter absence of mercy makes it an artfully written but distressingly sad tale related the chosen chaim potok","285":"i didn't expect to be as in to this book as i was it was difficult to read at times but i thought it was wonderfully written i enjoyed learning the details of the hasidic jew culture some of it was touching some was appalling i would definitely recommend it but all very interesting","286":"simply awful terrible writing sketchiness throughout storyline no depth to characters at all never cared about any of it bleh","287":"outstanding very well written","288":"different but interesting the ending took me by surprise","289":"really powerful and an interesting look at hassidism during ww2 and in the years immediately following","290":"what a haunting terrible book what little i already knew about orthodox judaism didn't impress me much but now this book fills me with horror at the risk of offending jews everywhere i'm so glad i wasn't born jewish i'm glad atara was able to escape and i'm glad the author anouk markovits was able to escape her real life","291":"this book was amazing but often really hard to read i think that having some background knowledge of hasidism helped me deal with many of the wtf moments here but the satmar as portrayed in this novel seem even more insulated than i would typically think of a hasidic community","292":" i decided to read this after i read unorthodox similar stories i heard both by women who left the satmars they said that couldn't be more wrong it is true that the author of this book anouk markovits left the satmar community as did deborah feldman but there the similarity ends in unorthodox the author clearly had an axe to grind and though she certainly had legitimate complaints her book was more an airing of grievances and a revelation of customs than the telling of a tale this however is a beautifully constructed tale not of one who left but one who stayed it is about love and loss and the unbending nature of satmar jewish law it's certainly not the jewish law i obey it's about the complete subversion of self while yearning to find a way to make oneself whole within the unforgiving rule of law in a nutshell it is the story of mila orphaned during the holocaust who is raised in the satmar community and tangentially about her relationship with her husband josef also orphaned and with her adoptive sister atara those who know me know that i shy away from emotional books too much like real life but this it's worth reading i am not sure if the fact that i am jewish explains some of my interest but it was fascinating and at the end of the day i feel very very sorry for the satmar girls not because they are insular and religious or because they pick piety over individuality but because they have so little freedom to deviate in the tiniest most personal ways perhaps the most disturbing passages relate to proscriptions against seeking help for infertility forbidding pleasure within a marriage damning generations of children","293":"just couldn't make it through it just didn't flow well enough for me to lose myself in the story and it was repetitive so it didn't hold my interest long enough to pass the life is too short to read books that i don't enjoy test","294":"a beautifully written story crossing several generations and differing life paths it is a gripping story based around a difficult to understand for me small segment of the jewish population i found myself quite angry by the time i was halfway through the book mostly because of my own beliefs which permit me joy in this life as well as in the world to come the ending was shocking but understandable","295":"i recommend this","296":"quite thought provoking the author brings up some interesting history","297":"from the paper http www thereportergroup org artic","298":" this story made me speechless in so many ways i can go on about how religion makes us all idiots but i digress if blind faith boils your blood this book is perfect for you i want to honor anouk markovits for her remarkable story she escaped her religious community when her family was going to force her into an arranged marriage with a stranger the book is a literal interpretation of her life and the struggles she went through 1 storyin post world war ii mila and josef witnessed the murder of their families during the war their lives intertwine when they meet zalman stern mila develops a strong sisterly bond with his daughter atara together they experience the strong religious community's influence over their destiny atara finds solace in books forbidden by her people that leads to her exile mila follows her faith where she enters an arranged marriage and commits a grave sin that could result to the banishment of her family and their generations i adore the storyline it was real and personal nowadays not many stories reflect the real lives of people and the impact of these stories on our society i liked how the story extends over five decades we start with atara and mila first meeting to their adolescent teenage years to mila's marriage and downfall the ending was great but i prefer the climax 2 charactersmila witnessed her parents murdered when her mother approached the rebbe to save them she has nothing but atara left in this cruel world however she finds her passion in her faith the same faith that would ruin her and atara's relationship for decades she wasn't a bad character because of her blind faith she doesn't let her faith totally influence her decisions atara is the world to her and never denied her when she was acting sinfully her love and desire to her husband josef wasn't superficial she would go so far as to desecrate her religion in order to save her family atara is someone i truly admire she never wanted to deface or dishonor her family but was forced to i wish she was in the story more and we went into what happened to her after exile she has no regret with the decisions she made 3 styleeverything was brilliant in the novel it is definitely not an easy read because there is more to the plot there is a lot of jewish references that it takes time to understand rebbe was used a lot and i had no idea what it was zionism is another aspect to the story i didn't know about this is some story that was creatively processed by an author it was real 4 overallhttp s993

literally had to force myself to finish","300":"good story but too much prayer i understand why and it makes sense for this book but because of that i found myself scanning a lot of the pages instead of being truly engrossed","301":" this book follows a family of hassidic jews from during the war up until present time their family goes from transylvania to paris to nyc there are a lot of characters but the ones who get focused on the most are two girls adoptive sisters and how they are able to fit into the world around them it was interesting learning about a culture i knew little about and i was kind of shocked how many babies were born over the course of the book most married women had a baby about every year and were having babies from when they married in their late teens through when their kids were getting married they were still having more babies it would be hard to support that many children but that's beside the point the book was interesting and ends on a very sad note i recommend it","302":"i thought this book was interesting but i had a hard time with the writing style it was a glimpse into a completely different world of religious fundamentalism though you could tell at times it wasn't completely objective","303":"an interesting look at a family of hasidic jews as they progress through generations","304":"epic saga centered on the hasidim ultra orthodox jews good view of its joys and perils and general self limited worldview two girls are raised as sisters 1 being a wwii created orphan one chooses the outside world even knowing her family will completely reject her while the orphan chooses to stay read alike to the 19th wife city of veils and the good daughter a memoir of my mother's hidden life","305":"this book provided an interesting look at the hasidic culture the plot however was a little bit underdeveloped in my opinion the events that take place could have been a really powerful story but it felt rushed at times and parts of the story could have been much more descriptive","306":"i highly recommend this book the beginning was kinda hard to follow but then it took off and wow this story follows mila and josef thru their lives from just before wwii onto modern times the most interesting aspect of the story was the look into the life of a hasidic satmar jew the author was raised as a satmar jew and gives the reader an in depth feel into a culture that you might never really get a glimpse into the writing in the book was very good as well the author really brought you into the story and made you fell what the characters were going thru","307":" this novel draws from the life of the author markovits was raised in the satmar tradition an ultra conservative jewish sect she left it at the age of nineteen to avoid an arranged marriage and went on to further education eventually earning a doctorate the novel follows three characters and begins in transylvania romania near the end of world war ii josef a young jewish boy survives the murder of his family and is taken in by the family's gentile maid passed off as her own child another jewish family is killed rushing to meet the rebbe they believed would save them leaving a young daughter mila josef helps mila reach the jewish community her father wanted her to go to and she is raised by a family there but never forgets josef years later mila's story leads to josef being taken back into the jewish fold and sent to a religious life in the new world mila and her adopted family flee to paris mila grows close to her adopted sister atara just a year younger than her but while mila feels compelled to be a good jewish woman and to one day reunite with her murdered family atara is full of questions questions she is told it is not her place to ask as these three characters' lives converge and separate we see how the question of faith becomes central to their relationships and ultimately leads them to join together at one final crisis point i learned a lot about this jewish sect and about romanian jews that i didn't know before i found the characters interesting and would have liked to have more of atara's story","308":"i would give it three and a half stars it was good just went in a different direction that i didn't love","309":"a family is torn apart by fierce belief and private longing in this unprecedented journey deep inside the most insular hasidic sect the satmar sweeping from the central european countryside just before world war ii to paris to contemporary williamsburg brooklyn i am forbidden brings to life four generations of one satmar family opening in 1939 transylvania five year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard and is rescued by a gentile maid to be raised as her own son five years later josef rescues a young girl mila after her parents are killed while running to meet the rebbe they hoped would save them josef helps mila reach zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in whose home mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara as the two girls mature mila's faith intensifies while her beloved sister atara discovers a world of books and learning that she cannot ignore with the rise of communism in central europe the family moves to paris to the marais where zalman tries to raise his children apart from the city in which they live when the two girls come of age mila marries within the faith while atara continues to question fundamentalist doctrine the different choices the two sisters makes force them apart until a dangerous secret threatens to banish them from the only community they've ever known a beautifully crafted emotionally gripping story of what happens when unwavering love unyielding law and centuries of tradition collide i am forbidden announces the arrival of an extraordinarily gifted new voice and opens a startling window on a world long closed to most of us until now not sure how i felt about this book i didn't love it but i didn't dislike it the story was good but at times it was hard for me to comprehend i thankfully do not live under such jewish laws it was enlightening to read about the satmar community","310":"markovits does a masterful job portraying deep characters in very tense settings most notably those wrought from what can reasonably be considered religious zealotry but also the trapping of humanity no matter where you're from religion aside the problems in this novel are those of real people and markovits gives them the depth--of character and situation--that they deserve with flashbacks and plot twists the pace moves well but not too quickly especially for those familiar with hassidic jewry this novel will resonate","311":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits is a brilliant poetic novel that begins during world war ii in eastern europe and ends in contemporary williamsburg brooklyn during world war ii two children become orphaned one a young boy named josef loses his parents and sister to storm troopers and is adopted by a peasant woman in translylvania her name is florina and the two of them forge a loving bond she renames him anghel and baptizes him to protect him from the nazis in yet another scene a young girl named mila watches as her pregnant mother runs toward an open railroad boxcar calling \"rebbe rebbe\" and is shot down mercilessly by the nazis she is taken in by a satmar family a sect of hasidim the zalmans adopt her and bring her up with love and as one of their own they have a daughter named atari who is nearly the same age as mila atari and mila grow up together as time progresses mila becomes more and more observant of the satmar beliefs along with its laws and observances atari seeks to leave the sect and make a secular life for herself this is considered heinous and the title of the book comes from this leaving for ten generations she and her offspring are 'forbidden' they are estranged from the family and not permitted to participate in any of the satmar rituals or be acknowledged by family members marriages are arranged by the satmar and mila is matched with josef who as a young boy was separated from florina and sent by the zalmens to williamsburg in order to study torah this is a marriage of love despite it being arranged the goal of satmar hasidim is to be fruitful and multiply if after ten years of marriage there are no children the husband is permitted to leave his wife and file for divorce after ten barren years mila is afraid that josef will leave her despite knowing that he loves her and that they share a good life together they are b'shert which means that under the eyes of god they are meant for one another atari meanwhile has left her home in paris where the zalmans were living and is in new york making documentary films she is a forbidden one the connections between the characters throughout time geography and family is beautifully rendered the story is a prose poem that is sensuous poignant and tragic i loved the story though the first twenty pages or so were a bit confusing once i was past that i was riveted to the book and could not sleep for wanting to finish it in one sitting ms markovits according to the book jacket \"was raised in france in a satmar home breaking from the fold when she was nineteen to avoid an arranged marriage \" she went on to college and graduate school not something that is considered possible for satmar women i am forbidden is her first work in english and i eagerly await her future work","312":"i picked up this book because it received a positive review in bookmarks glad i did","313":"this book started out promising but went downhill the story line could have been more developed it would have been nice to hear about atara's life after she leaves the fold of hassidism the circumstances of mila's pregnancy seem completely unrealistic judith's character seems very one dimensional","314":"i couldn't put it down beautifully written poetic and ultimately tragic","315":"very interesting book let me glimpse into a faith that makes me want to learn more","316":"this book's very well written but it was just too emotional for me to read i'd definitely recommend it but you're going to need to steel yourself","317":"uch i don't even understand how she justifies sleeping with a complete stranger i just didn't understand it and not sure why it had to start with zalman stern having wet dreams not sure that added anything the whole thing was just such a downer you could see her bias in her writing a friend wrote in her review heartbreakingingly sad really the story itself was ok but not sure most people would understand what the whole problem of mamzerus is about","318":"i read this for book club and think it will be an interesting discussion it opens during the ethnic cleansing of nazi germany so you know the main characters hasidic jews have lived lives of great sadness and suffering it shows how devout members of a religious sect may struggle with the rules of their leaders but still want to follow even to the death the edicts life everlasting in god's realm is a powerful incentive","319":" powerful critique of the idea that those holier can play by their own rules from judah whose illicit relationship begot king david to the satmar rebbe who begged to be on the kasztner train i found some of the language strange such as pram for stroller eiderdown for blanket also the choice of name for one of the main characters atara was strange for a satmar family there were some minor chronological issues the professor who had a special interest in the kasztner trains because he was on the trains in his mother's womb couldn't have been more than 25 years old maybe that's a normal age for a professor but it struck me as odd","320":" ny times gave this book a very positive review i'm pretty ambivalent story of an orthodox jewish family satmar survivors who have taken in two orphaned jewish children they travel from romania to paris to the orphaned daughter and son who marry to williamsburg but one daughter has doubts and leaves the community only returning to the story in the last chapter it is supposedly a sympathetic look at the satmar community and it's fundamentalist religious beliefs but i didn't find anything sympathetic about the characters just deeply troubling in the rigidity and beliefs hard to read and like","321":" this is markovits' english debut stretches from central europe to present day brooklyn it is the story of a family steeped in the satmar tradition a very strict isolated hasidic jewish group 2 sisters one follows the ways of her family the other rebels and leaves for an education and life among the modern world which means no contact with her family markovits herself was raised as a satmar and broke with them at 19 to get educated in the us where she now lives i found this very interesting and very sad","322":"good book to stoke anyone's anti fundamentalist feelings characters are mostly cardboard set up to represent different aspects of the author's agenda the most compelling writing are the scenes during the paris uprising of the 60's the least believable is the ending","323":" wow i can't get this one out of my head the language is spare the story beautiful and terrifying i gulped it down in one 3 hour stint the last hour of which was spent outside the grocery store sitting in my car saying one more page and i'll go in i could not put it down and yet it's a quiet book not a thriller in any way i loved peeking into a world that is not my own satmar i felt that the world was portrayed fairly i've been wrestling since with the idea of sacrifice of leadership and morality and most especially about intentionally electing to live in an inflexible world","324":"i really enjoyed this book i learned alot about the hasidic community their beliefs and customs the story spans the time from world war ii til the present have plenty of kleenex handy","325":" while i enjoyed the novel i will admit i felt like the chunks of time that were skipped over contained information character choices lifestyles that i'd like to have seen more thoroughly though the main character hasidic law stole the show i would've liked to learn more about the people affected by being born into it don't get me wrong choosing to follow tradition and interpreting the laws was the focal point of the novel but atara goes missing for many years forgoing the push she offered to the pull the detailed insight on the hasidic sect is what made me really like this novel it's a world i'd never have been introduced to otherwise ms markovits immediately submerges the reader in the hasidic sect and never let's go i was fascinated","326":"wow incredible book drew me in fast and didn't let me go i had no idea about the satmar rebbe's escape i assume that story is true the reality behind this novel","327":"i can't wait to discuss with my book club so many topics religion love and loss sacrifice so interesting to read about the hasidic beliefs culture loved how the three main characters lives crossed each other i would definitely recommend it","328":"learned some things i didn't know before and it made me question some of my own beliefs","329":" this is a very good book if only because it's about a subculture i've never had an opportunity to observe i've been to poland and worked pretty closely with what's left of the jewish community in wroclaw but they were not hasidic jews fascinating my first impression was that the characters of mila and atara all of the characters really were not developed very well they were one dimensional then i realized that that was probably intentionally done and it was damn clever the point of this underdevelopment i assume was to emphasize that the religion allowed for very little personality development and individuality rote worship was expected of all what a way to live i'll read what this author writes next i hope she has more to say because she's got my attention now","330":"this novel kept me up late reading fantastic conflict beautiful writing and a very interesting set of characters who are hasidic jews","331":"i would have liked to know more about atara and her life on the outside how she learned to cope","332":"i read this in literally 24 hours it was one of those books that absorbs every waking hour i have even when i'm not reading it i'm thinking about it and wondering when i can get back to it it's a really intimate portrayal of a satmar hasidic family that ranges from transylvania to paris to williamsburg like one of the reviews i read of it said it could have been one of two easy books the free spirit escaping oppression or the family eschewing modernity to hew to tradition but the author treats every person and place with warmth and dignity the hook of the book for me was that it took place in the hasidic community whose members i see in my neighborhood every day but what's fantastic about this book is how it draws you in so close to the characters to experience their joys and struggles the prose itself is gorgeous as well i recommend this book so so highly","333":"i couln'dt put this book down i began to read and became more and more envolved in the story an insightful book that i highly reccomend","334":"so sad but so captivating","335":"a well written story of multiple generations of hasidic family starting in transylvania in 1939 and carrying to modern day new york city the author grew up in a hasidic household she most certainly knows this life the story is compelling and the characters are well developed and believable recommended","336":"this book was very educational to me because i did not know anything about hasidic jewish culture it took me a little while to get into the book because of the writing style but after a while i found myself wanting to know how the lives of atara and mila were going to develop i did feel that the ending was a bit rushed and kind of left wanting more from the characters overall this was a good read i won this from the goodreads giveaways","337":"such a fascinating plot deserved more fully fleshed out characters this especially applies to the characters introduced at the end of the book xdaasa","338":"this was a fantastic book and i breezed right through it it's always interesting to read about other cultures i'll never understand how people can do such extreme things in the name of religion","339":"lovely but sad the cage of strict religion and systems of belief erodes the happiness of the characters pushing them away from each other and away from joy as they try to find a way to be pious and more near to god","340":" i started this book on friday morning and i had to make myself put it down to go to bed friday night i then ignored my wife saturday morning to finish i raced through this book because i loved the two main ish female characters their world might have been alien to me but i felt like i knew them and i had to know where they ended up this is essentially a family saga beginning around world war ii and ending in about 2007 starting in romania in the late 1920s the story roughly follows two jewish children josef and mila who are part of a conservative hasidic sect orphaned by violent antisemitism and world war ii josef and mila are taken in by zalman stern and his family josef is eventually sent to new york city to study with the community's beloved rabbi while mila moves with the sterns to paris mila becomes close to zalman's daughter atara faced with the secular world so directly the sterns also struggle with the changing mores and values in the jewish community zionism reform movements lingering antisemitism and eventually both mila and atara are sent to a conservative seminary to study before their arranged marriages it is there that atara and mila discover they want different lives atara wants to go to university while mila wants only to make a good marriage this might seem like a very simple set up but i'm not conveying the real heft and beautiful mood of the story mila's marriage is as typical and atypical as one might imagine and the results of her choices are staggering i teared up more than once but had to keep reading i was absolutely in love with mila and atara and i wished this novel was double the length so i could have spent more time with them my sole complaint i suppose is that atara's side wasn't fleshed out as much as i would have liked but that would have derailed this book's arc this is a novel about community belonging faith and family about love and desperation and everything in between it's a meaty story that reads airy and despite the fact that i know nothing about this religious community i understood and empathized with the characters they were so real and so human and i they captured me from the first page i miss them already","341":"this book is historical fiction drawing on the author's heritage in hasidic judaism because this world is largely unknown to many the setting for the story is interesting the contrasts between the daughter and the adopted daughter is a captivating platform for the story which illustrates that for some the structure and rules of a religious culture are a source of comfort and strength and for others are confining and drive them to separate from and reject the culture and religion the story line reflects the author's personal choice to leave the hasidic community with strict adherence to the torah as applied by the hasidim producing catastrophic and calamitous consequences it is a quick read that keeps your attention with every turn of the page","342":" heartbreaking i wasn't sure where the story was going to go at first but i was drawn in by the crispness of the writing and the fullness of the characters even though none of them are overly descirbed these are people you have hopes for and want them to find happiness the synopsis is a bit misleading as the story continues only with mila once atara makes a fateful decision she doesn't reappear until almost the end of the story we get only the life among the hasid i think that works well because mila can't imagine or doesn't even want to think of a life outside due to losing her parents and what it would mean if she didn't live her life as she believes she must josef is probably my favorite character enduring such upheavel in his youth but perservering and trying to be who he's expected to be his struggles were so painful to read one thing if you aren't familiar with this world it might be helpful to do a quick wiki search and learn the basics of their beliefs and lifestyle i'm was left wondering about some traditions so i did that also there are bits of history of which i was totally unaware and was in fact shocked to learn the writing style draws you into the story and i'd definitely read this author again","343":"i bought this book thinking it was an autobiography turns out it is extremely loosely based on the author's life the beginning is very confusing and she tries to cram the life stories of four generations into less than 300 pages could have been so much better","344":"although the story is compelling and offered some interesting and heretofore unknown to me detail about the stiffling nature of extreme religion the novel was disappointing i found it confusing at times and missing something incomplete","345":"a powerful novel i couldn't put it down it led me to research and learn more about some of the events and culture in which the book is set","346":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here part 1 is my initial goodreads entry in response to the book part 2 is the

markovitz follows a szatmar family as they move from transylvania to paris to new york gaining and losing members along the way the szatmar rebbe's rejection of zionism figures centrally in the story

in ny when beckoned by her sister as girls they were inseparable as adults they were estranged among the central inspired themes of the novel is the story of tamar who sinned to stay pure a paradox judah her father in law proclaims her more righteous than himself the author's inspired choice of this biblical tale is arresting 2 washtenaw jewish news i am forbidden is a stunning novel written with eloquence and economy it follows several generations of a satmar hassidic family from transylvania to paris france to brooklyn ny the tale is told with a rare mix of tenderness resentment nostalgia and perspective and it offers a rare glimpse into the world of satmar hassidim the story begins through the eyes of a child a little boy who witnesses the murder of his family he is whisked to safety by the family's servant who removes his yarmulke and payess sidelocks and raises him to be christian time passes quickly he almost forgets his heritage - until he witnesses a jewish family shot in cold blood and rescues their little girl anouk markovits grew up in the world of satmar hassidim her writing brings to mind a poignant axiom to make a story universal make it very specific in her story the foreign words that permeate the writing add color texture soul and strangely enough universality markovits' fluency in french yiddish english and hungarian helps her to flesh out these characters as they journey through the chaos of 20th century europe ultimately two branches of the family survive one in paris the other in williamsburg brooklyn the blend of languages is arresting especially when the language of desire becomes a memorable mix of yiddish english and french at the story's core are two sisters mila and atara their father is a man whose own travails we have followed he is strict but loving the sisters are inseparable until the two unwittingly violate the sabbath one sunny day atara bears the brunt of their father's wrath she then turns inward trusting only her intellect for guidance the books she reads clandestinely are taboo yearning for higher learning she leaves her family at which point she disappears from the novel too the reader like her family is left to wonder what became of her the story turns to mila grateful compliant devoted to tradition it is a curious plot twist we wonder what became of atara like jacob we must settle for the sister surprisingly this switch enriches the plot mila the \"good\" daughter finds herself in an arranged marriage that proves as romantic as any fairy tale her bridegroom had once rescued her from certain death but life interferes lest i spoil the book i will not divulge their tribulations suffice it to say that eventually she turns to the story of tamar for consolation the biblical tamar desperate for justice turns to harlotry in a sense tamar sins to stay pure a paradox ultimately tamar is declared a righteous woman markovits' reference to this biblical tale is inspired for a tale spurred by indignation and longing this story is remarkable for its compassion - and for its autobiographical overtones markovits grew up in france and like atara left her hassidic roots she fled at 19 after being sent to new york to marry a man she never met eventually markovits earned a bachelor of science degree from columbia a masters in architecture from harvard and a ph d in romance language from cornell it is tempting to speculate that markovits has taken her own story and split herself in two hence the sisters by exploring the path not taken markovits examines the life she might have led mila's life at the same time she gives a nod to the free spirit who establishes a career and keeps her own counsel in fiction markovits can reunite these women the two parts of herself and restore however fleetingly a sense of family but she cannot tell her satmar forebears that they revere a man she deems a coward the original satmar rebbe joel teitelbaum was rescued from the nazis by zionists but teitelbaum excoriated zionism and taught his followers to do the same this historic truth is at the heart of the novel atara cannot tolerate the community's erasure of their leader's betrayal in her eyes his behavior is unpardonable atara could never have lived mira's life this book is an act of courage and literary prowess it is markovits' second novel the first was written in french she wrote this one in english more","347":" wow even after i read the last page and closed the book this story lingered it still does this book was horrifying haunting depressing unnerving heart wrenching fascinating mesmerizing captivating and gripping a page turner set in europe during the final years of wwii 'til present day this is the story of a hasidic jewish family who have endured more than their fair share of trials the story begins with a young boy witnessing his mother and sister's murder later he witnesses a young girl's mother and father being murdered then he rescues the girl and sends her on to safety thus begins the story i've never read a book detailing the customs of the hasidic jews i'm sure there are different sects of hasidic jews so their traditions beliefs and customs probably vary i'm amazed at the faith adherence and extreme obedience these people displayed in the book i'm certain that those who are able to commit to this lifestyle will be rewarded for such steadfast devotion to their faith because it would be hard i must admit though i was disturbed by some of the traditions rituals it may well have to do with my ignorance on the subject and i'm also wondering if perhaps the author painted a bit of a negative light on the religion the author herself was a part of the sect but broke free from it as a young adult perhaps both this was a fascinating read i highly recommend it","348":"unusual but interesting story of young women in the hasidic community both in europe and the us","349":"i was mildly interested in seeing this book then saw it at the library and decided i'd like a quick easy read book was ok i couldn't get over thinking about markovits being the wife of larry berger","350":"this was recommended highly by the nytimes book review and usually it's a bit stodgy for me but i have to say this novel about the hassidic sect that raised me and about a young woman who decides to leave it is blowing my mind i am absolutely enthralled by everything about this book and if you get the chance i recommend it it's probably the best shot an outsider has to getting a window into the life of this community","351":"a fascinating look into hassidic tradition the characters fall flat as he plot is nothing more than an interesting study of why people choose such extreme lifestyles in the name of faith","352":"following four generations of an insular hasidic sect i am forbidden is an excellent portrayal of the challenges of faith community and family focusing on religious laws and traditions a story of strife love and endurance is woven around a post world war ii jewish community well written with a heartbreaking but inspiring plot","353":"a little confusing and unengaging at first but once the story of mila u0026amp atara began to unfold i was more interested in the story it is a fascinating look into a hidden society i found many aspects very sad and disturbing from a human rights perspective","354":" here's a twist i didn't like the beginning or the end but enjoyed the middle a few chapters in i found the writing style too sort of impressionistic i scanned some reviews and was surprised how overwhelmingly positive they were the only negative reviews i saw complained of growing attached to characters who then disappeared for several chapters i stuck with it because i'm interested in the subject matter and because it's a book club selection i became engrossed in the parts about mila and atara's adolescence atara's desire to read secular books and mila's marriage the contrast between the two women illustrates the struggle of women in the orthodox faith unfortunately i was disappointed in the ending","355":"tragic and terrifying i'm not sure i've ever read a book so full of longing a very quick read with a million more pieces of the story going untold","356":"i really wanted to like this book but i just couldn't get into it part of my problem is that the names are so unfamiliar that i had a hard time keeping track of who was who i finally gave up trying to figure it out","357":" not great at writing reviews but felt compelled to say that this book had a profound effect on me belief whether cultivated by an independent exploration or imposed by inherited circumstance can have tragic consequences nothing new in that but the ability to relate to the characters in this book that wanted so much to live within the cosy world of religious rules and protocols took my breath away people should remember that whatever they themselves believe even when the desire to jump on that idealistic band wagon is strong it's not always possible we judge at our peril a brilliant book","358":"i thought this book was really sad well written and did a good job of describing the horrors of the holocaust in transylvania and the satmar community through the eyes of its believers and disbelievers but i didn't love it as much as i thought i would given other reviews","359":" i found myself fascinated by the very different world the author introduces us to that of the satmar jews in paris just after world war ii it is very difficult for me to imagine willingly living life under such rigid rules and restrictions and i found myself sympathizing with the character of atara the rebbe's daughter who breaks away it would have been very interesting to know what happened to atara in the years between her leaving her father's house to avoid marriage and her encounter with judith the granddaughter of the other two main characters of course it would have been a different story with a different theme","360":"a glimpse into ultra conservative hasidic judaism an eye opener and a great read a little slow at times but a great cross section of their lives the narrative is great the female characters are wonderful","361":"really cool book i learned a lot about hasidic judaism and hungary romania during wwii worth reading and i finished it in one day","362":"another fabulous read i would give this book more than 5 stars it is beautifully written the characters and plot are compelling and i did not want it to end i appreciated the info in back of the book about the author's own life i want to meet her and ask her to come to my house for shabbas","363":" what an experience i feel like i've just returned to our world i know that i'll be haunted by this for quite a while that's good unsure how to rate or review forbidden will return to both though a few hiccups but i can't stop thinking about all that this book is and all her characters an hour after finishing forbidden i went back to it searching for certain parts that i wanted and longed to read again woke up at about 4am and decided that i'm going to read all of it again today need and want to get lost and immerse myself in it again still re reading one of the most incredible experiences that reading has ever given me","364":"interesting story many books are coming out about the satmer sect so it will be great to compare","365":"choppy read but interesting story sad ending","366":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here interesting look at the satmar hasidic community mila and joseph are both orphaned by the holocaust but are raised by surviving members of the satmar hasidic community they later marry and move to williamsburg brooklyn when mila is unable to conceive a child she turns to extreme measures to ensure that she can become a mother and remain married to joseph couples are supposed to divorce if they don't have children within 10 years i knew nothing about the satmar and this was an excellent lo interesting look at the satmar hasidic community mila and joseph are both orphaned by the holocaust but are raised by surviving members of the satmar hasidic community they later marry and move to williamsburg brooklyn when mila is unable to conceive a child she turns to extreme measures to ensure that she can become a mother and remain married to joseph couples are supposed to divorce if they don't have children within 10 years i knew nothing about the satmar and this was an excellent look at their beliefs and the difficulty of living with those beliefs i found the beginning of the novel which was set in transylvania during the holocaust and featuring the kastner train journey a little confusing since i wasn't familiar with the history the heart of the story really picks up when mila and joseph settle in williamsburg and i enjoyed the later parts of the story more i would have liked to spend more time with the character of atara mila's adopted sister who leaves the satmar for an intellectual life in the secular world overall this was a thoughtful look at religion fundamentalism that would also make a good book group discussion title more","367":" i am forbiddenby anouk markovitsfrom eastern europe during wwii to modern day new york city this book follows a family of hasidic jews through persecution coming of age childlessness and a secret that has repercussions for generations when i first heard of this book i thought it was going be dry and heavy but i was pleasantly surprised the story flowed and the characters were fairly relatable despite inherent cultural differences i was a little annoyed at how strict zalman was especially seeing as how it drove atara away from her family and religion but i think that was the point hasidic society has strict rules for behavior and interaction one site called it a menstrual obsession and for a culture who values large families being in tune with a woman's menstrual cycle would be logical i liked mila and josef a lot which made their subsequent childlessness and the ways they both tried to address it very painful i was saddened that they both didn't feel able to discuss the issue with each other honestly would that have changed much possibly mila wouldn't have gone out to find someone else to sleep with if she knew that josef was going to find a sterility expert what would they have done if they knew josef was sterile it's not like they could exactly go public with the news because it was against their faith for josef to provide a sperm sample obviously they loved each other and i don't think they would have divorced but what if they had josef remarried and he still didn't have children regardless mila really wanted a child how would she have taken the news of josef's sterility would she have acted unilaterally as she did or could they have come up with a solution together and it's probably trite but i wonder about adoption obviously mila was adopted by the zalmans so it's not like they necessarily look down on adoption within the community but from what little i know you can't exactly adopt into the jewish faith as matrilineal as it is i felt so badly for josef denying himself contact with mila even though i understand he's staying completely true to his faith but his body physically suffers and withers away i wonder how outsiders see his deterioration and mila she's so happy to finally have a child that she always wanted but i kept getting the feeling that the was purposefully blissfully unaware of what josef was going through that can't have been the case not for so many years but the narrative which sped up greatly during the last part of the book focused mainly on josef's struggle there's a glimmer of something when mila's granddaughter uncovers her secret but i get the feeling that any feelings of guilt or regret are locked down tight i suppose it would be difficult to regret the actions that got you the one thing you so desired but what did mila think as she watched josef go downhill throughout the years i don't suppose she ever tried to get pregnant again so perhaps that's acknowledgement enough did she ever want siblings for rachel since josef stopped touching her when he discovered she was pregnant that seems like an insurmountable barrier it was nice to know that atara was okay and had apparently done well for herself but bringing her back at the end to guide a grandniece to which i felt no real connection felt tacked on i suppose there really was no better way to end the story but we hadn't seen atara in decades it was weird having to play catch up to atara's life and be expected to care for both her and judith in such a short amount of time i suppose it was supposed to be a culmination but it felt more disjointed than anything i felt badly that judith committed suicide i think this is yet another secret that mila will take to her grave i wonder if mila and atara will continue to have contact with each other after this","368":"a quick read but a bit thought provoking for sure the satmar are strange and it is hard to fathom that kind of devotion and religion","369":"relatively quick read and well written didn't like the inflexibility of zallman and all that was lost but know this is realistic enjoyed the sparse writing style","370":"wonderfully written tale of grief love and faith","371":"two sisters raised in an hasidic home one embraces and the other rebels this most orthodox of judaism it reminded me of the book my name is asher lev it's difficult for my mind to wrap around the idea of this extent of orthodoxy the mysticism the stifling rules the sophistry the circuitous logic the author is an excellent writer this is one of those books you continue to think about after you put it down","372":"it was an intersting insight into a small religious sect not altogether different from other extremist religious sects but a unique perspective for me it also described aspects of the european jewish community during the war which i was not aware of","373":"a fantastic novel a very touching emotional story about war and the life of hasidic jews in europe and america the characters are honest and very religious the plot keeps you reading a book everyone should read","374":"very moving and thought provoking","375":"wonderfully written gives insight into a very private world of the satmar hassidim it is still hard for me to understand this very private fundamental sect it does however give you an insight into their thinking","376":"accidentally picked this book tale of satmar holocaust forward love devotion religious fervor among eastern european parisian williamsburgers working really well for the first half and then the hyper dramatic fortunately short scene of in which the characters lose their logical thinking unconvincing and fail to reach the third dimension in development the last half scuttles through another generation or two and tries to pick it back up book was heading for a five star but made a four generous me","377":"story that could happen in real story of tragic events from hasidic jews' lives the world of the people trapped between their strict religious commandments and laws and their human feelings of loneliness i read the book however i kind of forced myself to finish it i give it 3 stars","378":" with anouk markovits's \"i am forbidden\" we are transported to a place on the far end of the jewish religious spectrum the polar opposite of secular judaism this novel focuses on the hasidic sect known as the satmar like christianity which is fragmented into many variations of church worship judaism is not a monolithic practice this ultra orthodox version of judaism like those faithful to strict conservative muslim worship place man above woman without question this being their \"interpretation\" of the ancient writings inscribed on their prayer scrolls and texts and is part and parcel of the liturgy of their religious belief system as this novel progresses beyond the history of the emigration of zalman stern's family from transylvania northwest romania to paris in the aftermath of wwii and the holocaust when the majority of eastern europe's jewish population were exterminated this novel speaks of the complexity of a satmar woman's choice she has the obvious choice to live within the narrow confines of the covenants of a faith that limit a woman's societal role wherein she has an obligation to marry serve her husband bear many children and keep a strict kosher home but if this is an untenable future to embrace she'll have to look toward the world outside of her religious ghetto perhaps explore the freedom of pursuing personal educational enlightenment seek vocational opportunities to challenge her intellect and provide financial freedom or just liberate her spirit outside the confines of religious protocol so what happens if like atari zalman stern's brilliant daughter you're an intelligent questioning woman who doesn't cotton to the misogynistic interpretation of her religion and resents being a second class citizen you're probably going to have to either swallow these thoughts and fully digest them until they're voided from consciousness or you may have to decide to choose to live a life away from your satmar community forever shunned by your family and friends this is what atari and the author of this book were forced to decide...it's the crux of this story in my opinion also what of the righteous the god fearing woman like atari's sister her \"friend for life\" mila who embraces her religion with zeal and fervor expectant of god's blessings a house full of children only to find her home barren after a decade of marriage how does she cope ...what recourse does she have under jewish law ...to what ends would she go to achieve motherhood i found this novel of interest because of my present geography living within new york's catskill forest preserve a mountainous area 120 miles north of manhattan during the summer after the snow from the ski season has long since melted the neighboring village becomes transformed by an influx of hasidic jews from places like williamsburg ny the american locale of markovits's work this area is used as a summer retreat for many hasidim a place to pray recreate and commune with nature while furthering torah studies so when i see a man wearing a ceremonial \"shtreimel\" a large circular fur hat...think go kart tire shaped...with his long black coat beard and side curls prayer shawl and other accessories i can't help but ask myself \"what's his story \" when i see his bewigged wife hiding a shorn scalp wearing an ankle length skirt herding her gaggle of children again my curiosity is fueled and i ask \"what's their story \" ms markovits's novel answered many of my questions","379":"no sure what i expected reviews led me to believe it was the tale of two hasidic girls raised as sisters during and just after the holocaust the family lives in paris after fleeing central europe one mila sticks with the ultra orthodox and restrictive ways she ends up in williamsburg brooklyn even after learning that the head rebbe is the worst kind of hypocrite the other atara breaks free she sneaks out in the middle of the night and is therefore declared dead to her family alas we don't get the much of atara's pov at all we stick with mila and learn probably more than i ever wanted to know about the ways of the hasidic community a lot about their beliefs and practices yes there's a secret for which mila and her extended famiy pay tragically three stars maybe 2 5 since my personal expectations were not met yours may be","380":"a story about 4 generations of satmar jews and how decisions can have unintended consequences for future generations their customs are certainly not mainstream i am often amazed how faith can cause people to give up so much of their personal freedom","381":"there is so much i didn't know about this world i kept waiting for it to get really good but it sort of disappoints or maybe it's just the paralyzing position of women in this religion that makes me mad","382":"i did learn a lot about hasidic judaism which was pretty interesting but i never felt a connection to any of the characters i was still waiting for the real story to start when the book ended","383":"awesome book absolutely enthralling a must read historic fiction at its best","384":"what an amazing book i read this book in 2 days and had a hard time putting it down if you are at all curious about hasidic jews and the satmar culture this book is beautiful i cant wait to absorb more and write a full review","385":"i really loved the culture i was reading about in this book and the writing was beautiful i like the characters very much but i did not enjoy the end i guess it may be my misunderstanding of the beliefs but i just felt so depressed as i closed the book","386":"beautiful u0026amp somewhat haunting story we follow a hasidic satmar family for several generations from the end of the holocaust in eastern europe to the modern day in paris u0026amp williamsburg i've read other books with some of these themes but this book had a different take on those themes","387":"a story of a family of hasidic jews over generations","388":"enjoyed this book with a unique insight into a usually closed community of hassid jews sorry grief and guilt swirl around the novel but love also shines through","389":"an interesting look at the hypocrisy of fundamentalist doctrine and how it can affect its followers however a huge criticism i have is that the characters were not well developed my rating would be 3 1 2 stars if there was a half star option nonetheless an interesting read","390":"wow at first i couldn't understand what was going on but the author did an excellent job not writing about the war but leading us into the horrible effects of being torn away from loved ones and the dramatic effects of the holocaust amazing story that i couldn't put down so sad that thats what life is loved the history and the timeline interesting facts and accurate details hard life for all involved","391":" i was surprised how absorbing i found this i knew nothing of the satmar chasidim or their founder rebbe joel teitelbaum so while i was reading it i assumed everything was fiction since finishing it i've discovered that the setting and several crucial events which begin the story and are discussed later by some of the characters are historically accurate but what makes the work fascinating is the presumably relatively accurate view inside the satmar sect many of their beliefs are far from those of mainstream judaism and while it's hard for me to empathize with the characters who find the tyranny of the community a comfortable place to build a life i do feel i have a bit more understanding of them but what made the book so compelling were the characters whose difficult choices had consequences none of them could have predicted and whose emotional turmoil was riveting","392":" in the beginning i was intrigued by the jewish culture and mila's upbringing in the stern family but i became increasingly frustrated and disappointed by mila and joseph's marriage and the events that unfold part of it was the constraints of tradition but it seemed they were both willing to break from tradition to an extent either way would have been punishing to them the ending felt pushed and unnecessarily tragic but perhaps this was the moral of the story the constraints of religion have serious consequences whether you adhere or stray from them","393":"it made me a bit uncomfortable which i think was intended a bleak look into the ultra orthodox jewish community the first part of the story interested me the most but then major characters dropped out and it skipped through many years not a fan also a bit too much detail in the conceiving department it was a well written story though","394":"this book has had me thinking about it for a week before i could write this review it is the story of children in the hasidic jewish community during the rise of hitler in transylvania when young josef witnesses the murder of his family he is taken in by their christian maid who cares for him as her son later josef rescues a young girl mila and helps her find a family with zalman stern a satmar leader in zalman's home mila becomes a sister to atara his daughter the story follows these children as they grow up josef is taken from his christian mother and returned to the jewish sect forcefully he emigrates to america mila and atara's bond is very close as they grow up atara pulls away from the strictness of her father and their religion such heartbreak love and confusion accompany this family as atara leaves mila stays true to the faith eventually being we'd to josef as they make their home in america and mila attempts to be the perfect wife infertility threatens their relationship the writing is beautiful the characters real the jewishness often hard to understand but their story is touching and heartbreaking it seems as though if they would only talk more and open up to each other in all relationships their lives would have been easier but that was not their way i enjoyed gaining some understanding and a peek into this culture","395":"also recently read the 19th wife so drew many similarities between religions and their teachings heartbreaking to see people suffer and torture themselves in the name if piety and worthiness likewise uplifting to witness stories of hard won freedom understanding and peaceful lives told by identifiable characters with honest dreams","396":"i didn't know much about hasidic family life before reading this book and now i feel like i got a glimpse into that world or at least of that world as it was in different places and different decades the author grew up in a such a family so the parts of the book that deal with the two sister characters up until the marriage of the one is something that the author lived herself while there was clearly real love between some of the characters in the book the rules needed to be obeyed strike me as something that would keep real affection away","397":" women's friendshipsmarkovits writes of a romanian jewish community during world war ii they are from the satmar sect and have very strict beliefs and traditions there are two sets of parents one trying to flee to safety and another attacked in their home are murdered by fascists left behind are two children one from each family each is rescued the boy is adopted by the family maid she's a christian and tries to keep him safe by teaching him to 'pass' by adopting christianity and pretending to be her own child though she's misguided she loves him very much the girl is adopted and raised as a devout jew by her father's talmud study partner and bought up with his ever growing family in france i found the immersion in this unique culture fascinating but also heartbreaking both because of the world war ii atrocities but also because of how unbending and unforgiving the satmar tradition seems to be i also found this culture extremely loving and caring this contradiction is at the heart of the story i was reminded of lisa see's \"snow flower and the secret fan\" for two reasons see's book is centered on the very insular chinese culture of the 19th century which also had very strict traditions and expectations for men and women and their respective roles the second similarity between the stories was the central theme of women's friendships that were formed early and sustained through life's hardships i feel like i'm walking a tightrope when i say this but neither the satmar nor the 19th century chinese traditions were female hating even though they were dominated by male privilege but they did have unflinching expectations the orphan mila and her adopted sister atara were of one mind as children but in adulthood their paths forked each still held the other dear in her heart this is the best part of markovits's book the women's relationship holds it together and is emotionally affecting the story is told from various viewpoints and from many time periods but it remains clear markovits is an affecting skilled writer i didn't like the ending it felt forced i loved learning about a culture so different from any i'm familiar with the contrast between the rigidity of the satmar culture and the sweetness of the women's love for one another touched me deeply 3 5 5","398":"this book was very moving it took me a few days to process it very well written very sad after i finished i felt a little let down there are two main characters two sisters they both make different choices in their lives and end up leading very opposite lives though neither ended up happy at the end i ended up not liking one of the sisters at all a choice she made that brought so much pain to her family yes much joy but at a great cost to her husband i kept thinking about it after i was done with the book and feeling sadder and sadder if that makes sense but i guess any book that deals with the holocaust isn't going to be very uplifting worth a read","399":"a bit difficult to get into at first but once past the first few chapters it's a great read","400":" written by a french woman raised in the most insular hasidic sect the satmar who broke from the fold when she was 19 to avoid an arranged marriage this moving tale begins in 1939 transylvania when 5 year old joseph witnesses his parents and sister murdered by the romanian iron guard he escapes to be raised by a gentile woman years later joseph himself rescues a young girl after her parents are murdered that sounds terribly depressing but the story is beautifully told weaving the traditions of the satmar into the landscape of the war giving a different view of the holocaust how could one live in paris and not know of the richness of the city so many very specific rules govern the satmar as to be claustrophobic some find deep spiritual comfort in the rules they must follow whilst others can only question and long for a world outside the community of satmar","401":"just plowed through this in two days i haven't enjoyed reading something this much in a long time once i started i really couldn't stop","402":"i had the pleasure of meeting anouk during book expo america she thanked me for reading her book and she recalled watching my video review she was very french and very stylish and very delightful adorbs","403":"this was a good book not great i learned quite a bit of a different culture religion that i knew nothing about the results of that culture religion were devastating and sad my only complaint is the story was more focused on one girl than the other and i felt like i missed out what happen to the other sister it seemed a little rushed toward the end","404":" i am forbidden begins in 1939 transylvania where five year old josef who has crawled under the family table to pick up one of the wooden letters he thought was lost is the lone survivor when his family is murdered by the iron guard he spends the night under the table waiting for his sister's voice and is found the next day by the family's housekeeper as the jewish burial society takes his sister's body away the housekeeper florina stops her tasks as she sees josef and quickly takes him away to raise him as her own in the home of her parents she changes his name to anghel removes his sidecurls and has him baptized that night florina lulls him with \"mama wants anghel to live...\"years later as anghel becomes accustomed to this new life on this small farm near the railroad tracks and the river he wakes early to the sound of his dogs barking looking out his window he sees the shadowy figures of a man woman and a little girl he waits for florina to leave and then goes in search of these three peering through a hole in the shed's wall he sees them again a train approaches but doesn't slow to stop a second train approaches and the woman looks out the shed's window and sees the rebbe and rushes to him calling him one shot is fired and the man rushes to her as anghel's hand covers the little girl's mouth and pulls her from the doorway to hide behind the shed he tells her not to move that her mother would want her to live night falls and the two make their way through the market square where the girl's father slashed and bleeding is tied to a post her father renames her mila and tells her to go to zalman stern and begs the boy to tell them to see to it he is buried with his own mila's story begins as she appears at the door of zalman and hannah stern and their daughter atara and they raise mila as their own mila and atara sleep side by side and atara is the first to hear mila speak after a summer of silence later after zalman goes to the village where mila's father and mother died he meets the farm boy who tells him of gershon heller's request to be buried with his own when he returns with the news of her father's proper burial she speaks to zalman for the first time letting him know that the boy named anghel is a jew another child orphaned when zalman confirms his heritage he returns home with josef anghel but seven years with florina have dimmed his memories of his jewish heritage as zalman prepares josef for his bar mitvah he also prepares him for his move to america while zalman prepares his own family of their upcoming move to paris as a young girl atara is more willful questioning the rules and regulations of more and more in the satmar household mila fueled with her belief that her reunion with josef is a foretelling of her reunion with her parents submits to the satmar ways it is in paris that the story really begins to take on unexpected twists and turns and the characters really begin to add depth and their personal struggles take on an added dimension some sensational and some tragic this is anouk markovits second book her first book \"pur cotton\" was published in french i somewhat hesitantly give this four stars but three isn't really enough there are parts that don't really flow and parts that are disjointed between people coming and going different eras different locations that is to be somewhat expected there are on the other hand parts that are mysteriously bizarre and yet poetic \"atara liked to pray with mila she could tell that in mila's prayer the messiah's coming was not the glory of the temple rebuilt but a kitchen with mila's mother in it a bedtime with the story mila's father had not finished telling her \"","405":"i was fascinated by the author's insights into the worldview and customs of hasidic jews","406":" this lyrical thoughtfully written book took me by surprise unlike other tell all ex hasidic authors anouk markovits doesn't write about the one who leaves she may have left the fold but she doesn't have dirty laundry to air instead her novel is about the one who stays anouk writes in an interview the first agent i contacted said she would be interested in a memoir only but a memoir would have meant speaking mainly about myself and i could see that the scream of the one who leaves doesn't say much about those who stay i wanted to try to write about those who stay a novel would permit me to imagine the inner lives of people who made choices that differed from mine a novel would permit me to write about this unfashionable but urgent theme of belief the novel begins in the throes of the holocaust continues in post war france briefly dallies in post war england and ends in brooklyn many years later the story is about two orphans and the seemingly unspeakable price they will pay to rebuild and the unfathomable repercussions their choices will have for generations markovits' english debut is a must read which will stay with you long after the the final page is finished","407":"haunting and well written this book has been near to my thoughts since i read it this part weekend morality religion family traditions and culture all questioned as i glimpse a world and world view so very very different from my own","408":" a poorly written book yet an interesting look at the life of a hasidic woman without meaning to the book exposes all the hatred and prejudice of these fanatics as they cling to their superstitions each action of each moment of their day is strictly regulated with the goal to keep themselves apart from the sin that lies in everything and everyone around them i hadn't known before how virulent their hatred for zionists and the state of israel and that they blame the holocaust on the jews themselves for their sins regardless there's no coherent story here and after a while it just became more and more of the same ugliness and bigotry in the name of god","409":"i started out listening to this wonderful audio version narrated by rosalie landor saying its a definite 5 i felt like i was enraptured by the hassidic life before and after wwii starting out in transylvania romania and continuing on to paris the story started out perfectly and i felt swept away with emotion mila's parents are killed and she adopted by a rabbi's family with a ready made sister and friend atara to boot she is saved by a boy who is hidden by a christian woman after his parents are killed we learn how definitely the jews are hated and discriminated against and brutally beaten tortured and killed this before wwii during and after it is hard to listen to or read a story of violence and discrimination so deep in the hearts of monsters this is the best part of the book and after the 50's the book is not as cohesive the author so beautifully introduces the characters and then jumps decades and the story just goes too fast most books for me are very drawn out but this book could've read as a novella at the end it is beautifully written with flawed yet unflawed characters their hassidic faith forbids them from so much of life many gray areas many references to the torah which people of every religion can relate to i still like this book so much and recommend it highly perhaps we should blame this lopsided presentation on the editor someone was rushing to complete this book with such a beautiful beginning why were we rush toward the end readers of i am forbidden would've loved more with this type of writing we would've embraced a perfect novel","410":"using a staccato way of telling a gorgeous tale is at first off putting but soon it compliments and holds together this family saga a stupendous accomplishment by this excellent writer what harm to the human spirit may be done by the over more","411":" at times i see a person of great faith and i wonder how it is they believe so wholeheartedly so completely markovits creates in mila a character of such piety so beautifully crafted that i feel for the first time i get it i followed her every move and it was so logical and so convincing the story of mila and her sister from the family that adopted her atara who moved away from the religion is remarkable the way the story moves from transylvania toward the end of the war to paris as the family tries to craft a kosher life in an alien world and the scenes are heart wrenching for me what diminished the book was the way the ending was rushed the second half of the book once mila moves to williamsburg wasn't as convincing and the new characters who appeared at the end felt more like literary devices than real people i wanted more insight on mila's marriage and i thought that atara's story was left undone but i would still recommend this book and it's one i will dwell upon for a good while","412":" a quick read a fascinating peek into the psychology of rigid orthodoxy how it satisfies and how it destroys it's billed as the story of two ultra orthodox jewish girls who make different choices but i think it's bigger than that the narrative takes us through a whole series of forks in the road for its characters the boy who must choose between love and identity the girl who must choose between family and soul the woman who must choose between life and divorce the husband who must choose between law and mercy the granddaughter who well i won't spoil it like laura moriarty's the chaperone this is a book about to what extent we choose to live by the rules and where do those rules come from anyway it's a good book group choice","413":"i really liked this book it was so amazing to read i learned so much from it anouk markovits is such a great writer amazing book","414":" as the story opens in 1939 transylvania a 5 year old jewish boy josef witnesses the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard he is rescued by the family's christian maid and raised as her son five years later josef rescues a young girl mila after her parents are killed by the nazis after trying to avoid deportation joseph helps mila find the home of her father's friend zalman stern a leader in the satmar hasidic jewish community mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara as they grow into young women mila's faith intensifies while atara learns more about the outside world and wants to leave the faith even if it means her family will disown her mila has her own struggles later as a married woman in the satmar jewish faith a man is expected to divorce his wife if there are no children after 10 years of marriage and mila's inability to conceive leads her to an act of desperation this was a riveting story that had me hooked from the first chapter the author herself was raised in the satmar community but she left as a teenager to avoid an arranged marriage this story was hard to put down once i started reading there is a glossary in the back of many of the jewish terms used in the book but i also looked up a lot of information online as i was reading i always like it when a book i am reading leads to me want to learn more about a subject i won a free copy of this book from thereadingroom com","415":"loved this book a sad and beautiful story of love and faith and family and of the ties that bind","416":" after a rave nyt review i had high expectations for markovits's novel as markovits herself is a lapsed satmar hassidic woman i thought characters would have depth and show real conflicts between a life lived between satmar confines vs a life lived in the modern world however i found the plot quite linear and uncomplicated and the characters mere outlines of what they could have been for a novel that tells a textured story of rigid exegesis versus compassionate reinterpretation of jewish law see chaim grade's the agunah","417":"wonderful story tragic sad and educational for those who want an inside look into one of the world's most fasinating religions i only wish i knew that there was a glossary at the end of the book","418":"this book was awful nobody in my book club liked it and the only person that made it through the whole thing did so b c she listened to it on dvd","419":"interesting look at the lifestyle of the hasidic jews and what it means to defect the book was well written and informative","420":"an eye opener to other cultures and religions","421":"a look at the life of a hasidic jew from ww2 in transylvania to paris and nyc today it was interesting to see how the author tried to justify the actions of the characters because of their faith but it rang hollow perhaps because she left an ultra orthodox sect herself while it showed how difficult it can be to stay true to your faith if you are not surrounded by like minds i found it hard to empathize with the characters","422":"i literally could not put this book down i read i am forbidden in a single sitting which is very rare for me the novel spans roughly sixty years beginning with the childhoods of mila josef and atara in transylvania and ending with their grandchildren in williamsburg brooklyn markovits writes in a spare lyrical style that is positively haunting transitions between scenes and topics are quick and the novel progresses at quite a clip that's part of what makes it so hard to put down -- it feels like a train moving at breakneck speed and the only way to get off is to jump the relationships of mila josef and atara are marked by separation as much as they are by togetherness as children their lives are frequently turned upside down -- by the war by immigration by adoptive parents and religious conversions josef disappears from the novel during mila and atara's teen years when the two girls grow into themselves as women only to reappear as a twenty two year old man it's quite a romantic turn of events the love between mila and josef who met as children and meet again as adults at the beginning of a loving marriage as mila moves deeper into the satmar way of life atara questions it her willfulness her desire for learning illustrate how limited women are in this culture there are restrictions on what media they can consume who they can interact with and the only acceptable career path is that of a wife and mother atara as the black sheep of the family is absent for a large part of the narrative the reader sees her as a girl of eighteen and then not again until she is a woman of sixty four years without any glimpse into her adult life between those two points her reappearance after four decades reduces atara to the role of plot device the loss seemed that much greater because atara is one of the most expressive and three dimensional characters in the early chapters of the book markovits breathes such life into her and i wondered if atara was in some ways a representation of the author markovits' author bio mentions that she too left her satmar home at the age of nineteen and went on to pursue higher education the last section of the book was absolutely heartbreaking because it involves the penitent separation of husband and wife i couldn't imagine living with a spouse and and routinely denying intimacy or even casual touches but for the characters their obligation to hashem's law takes precedence above all else the title i am forbidden refers to people born outside the law and the strain it puts on a family either to keep it a secret or to be excluded from their community though the book contains moments of great sadness and frustration there is also great love love for family for children for the law markovits plays masterfully with the tension between an individual's impulse for freedom and the cultural demands of obedience it's a very moving novel one that will stick with you for a long time after you finish reading","423":"i read this book as a follow up to unorthodox it is fiction but gives a better understanding of the satmar community in williamsburg also focuses in the collaboration between adolf eichmann and the satmar rebbes escape to switzerland in ww 2 as a sub plot","424":"a book i will probably go back to thought provoking re the meaning of family heritage secrets more","425":"i honestly didn't know what to expect from this book but i was more than pleased with what it gave me i picked it up for research on the jewish culture as i will be involved in fiddler on the roof i can honestly say that this story reminded me of a time when i was completely obsessed with the holocaust and jewish culture in general that being said this is definitely a bit more difficult to read than the diary of anne frank and other such books but it is well worth the effort","426":" this book took a bit to get into but i really enjoyed it once i did it can be a little slow going since a lot of the story is peppered with yiddish phrases but i found that i could largely skim over those parts and not miss much parts of this book are extremely sad it's hard to believe that there are young girls currently living in america with so few options open to them it's quite obvious that the author is against this lifestyle considering she escaped from it to avoid an arranged marriage but i very much enjoyed being immersed in such a drastically different culture which left me feeling very grateful for the freedom and opportunities i have","427":"loved it having grown up in brooklyn myself not far from williamsburg i was always curious about the hasidim this book vividly portrays a lifestyle far from my own jewish experience fascinating stuff","428":" when you are born into a family culture religion where you don't fit in what do you do if you do fit in but later events cause you to to make decisions outside the code then what these are the challenges faced by atara and mila who become sisters during the war when mila is orphaned and taken in by the sterns a strict hasidic family each girl will follow her own path through life was the name stern a random choice i suspect not one of the more fascinating aspects of this novel is its depiction of life within the hasidic community there are so many rules it boggles my mind growing up in brooklyn i had occasional brushes with hasids which stimulated my curiosity about how they lived this book gave me some insight into that world i would love my book club to read this as i know we would have a lively discussion","429":"disappointing a novel with many settings from transylvania to paris overshadowed by fascism and then communism and always the story of jews hated by those who hate jews the story of a jewish boy child raised by a non jew seems a gimmick nevertheless the setting details are interesting and well done","430":"more like a 3 5 than a 4 0 but an interesting read","431":"i chose this book because i'm fascinated by the culture and the book did not disappoint with intimate details of daily life in the satmar world i had not anticipated for such a short novel the history lessons events i verified online as historically accurate or throw back to my college ethics course ultimately though it was gripping and i nearly read the entire book in one sitting","432":"i was totally enthralled by the book because it opened a world of knowledge about this unique religion and its rites the characters are fully developed and very empathetic","433":"achingly lyrical","434":"can't sorry alice","435":"i found the beginning a little difficult to get through but the storyline kept me reading anyway i learned a great deal about a subject that i thought i had an adequate amount of knowledge about perhaps this book rated so well with me was because it confirmed some of my own preconceived notions","436":"i definitely struggled thru the first half of the book but was literally up all night tearing thru the second half very fascinating the whole thing","437":"starts off strong but rushes to the finish the primary conflict is not given the same attention that the early backstory does which leaves the reader wondering why they should care at all characters are underdeveloped including atara who goes from early lead to last minute plot construct it reads like a 2nd draft with potential not like a finished book which indicates poor editorial support for a new author","438":" i am forbidden takes place in 1939 in translyvania in the satmar community josef a little boy witnesses the murder of his parents by the nazi regime he is rescued by a christian maid five years later josef rescues a jewish girl mila after her parents were killed running to meet the rebbe they hoped would save them josef helps mila reach zalma stern the leader of the satmar community there the zalman's raise mila as their own with their own daughter atara meanwhile josef is sent to america specifically williamsburg in new york city as the girls mature mila's faith becomes observant as any person would being raised in the satmar community while atara's faith is continually questioned with the love of books arts and learning not by the satmar traditions but by the secular world she continually questions the fundamental ideas of the jewish and satmar community when the girls reach adulthood mila marries in the faith but atara is banished by the community and her parents for years the girls don't speak or contact each other until one day mila marries within the faith while atara continues to to question the fundamental ideas of the satmar jewish faith after 10 years of marriage mila is unable to conceive she makes one decision that will affect her marriage and her children for years to come my review i picked up this novel because it was about the satmar jews i don't know much about this sect i have been exposed to orthodox modern orthodox and chabad but never to the satmar i had to do my own research to find out about them reading this novel was a eye opener the author wrote this to open up a discussion about fundamentalism there is many things as i am reading the novel i don't agree with some of the traditions are very extreme i would think if you were raised in the satmar community you would not question because you don't know anything different but as you get older the world opens up to you mila did something that was life changing and never told anyone this lie cost her her marriage and her family i enjoyed reading most of the novel i could not put it down to the very end if you like historical fiction and jewish faith and bible and jewish communities you will like i am forbidden you can read more about satmar jews here read more of my thoughts of i am forbidden at my blog http susansliterarycafe blogspot com","439":"strength and orgin of hasidic beliefs told through three generations from wwii to 2011","440":"if you enjoy reading about different cultures religious believers and the choices that people make in the name of their religion this book is for you the book opens in world war 2 era transylvania and focuses on the jewish community the writer has an easy enjoyable style of writing that carries the reader quickly into the lives of the main characters as one reads what is occurring you might find yourself asking what would i do in this situation i have no doubt that many will be taken back by some of the very restrictive practices that the characters had to deal with in their everyday activities to uphold their standing in the jewish society ms markovits gives the reader an intimate look into the family structure of the jewish family you learn what the expectations are for all the members of the family and just how vastly different the expectations are for the different ages and sexes a society where young women were taught to help rear children and at age 17 are glad to have an arranged marriage once married their role was to financially support their husband while he studied the jewish religion until children were produced the young boys were schooled at an early age on studying the jewish religion they were required to spend the majority of their time inside studying the goal was to become a rabbe this above is a small part of what you are about to experience you will get to see humanity at both its best of times and worst of times the desperate choices that people make when it appears that all they hold dear is about to crumble","441":"fabulous read could not put this one down","442":"sweeping from the central european countryside just before world war ii to paris to contemporary williamsburg brooklyn i am forbidden brings to life four generations of one satmar family in 1939 transylvania five year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard he is rescued by a christian maid who raises him as her own son five years later josef rescues a young girl mila after her parents are killed while running toward the rebbe they hoped would save them josef helps mila reach zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in whose home mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara with the rise of communism in central europe the family moves to paris to the marais where zalman tries to raise his children apart from the city in which they live as the two girls mature mila's faith intensifies while her beloved sister atara discovers a world of books and learning that she cannot ignore a beautifully crafted emotionally gripping story of what happens when unwavering love unyielding law and centuries of tradition collide i am forbidden announces the arrival of an extraordinarily gifted voice and opens a startling window on a world closed to most of us","443":"this novel made me think a great deal about the nature of freedom and choice juxtaposed we have two protagonists mila who seeks solace from the cruelties of the world by delving deeper into her faith and atara who having lost nothing questions everything around her it's an extremely interesting view of a little known sect of hasidic judaism as well as being an intriguing study in human choice i sympathized with both characters i understand mila's deep desire to follow the map that's been laid in front of her to trust in the rituals that underpin her entire existence and yet she is also the one who realizes that to fulfill the traditional role that her culture religion and her heart demands she must do something which goes against all three a single action to make that happen at 25 snowballs into a life time of penance for her and her marriage and eventually her granddaughter in atara on the other hand i can see a lot of any intelligent sensitive young woman character her questioning mind is repeatedly condemned by her parents her school teachers her religious leaders even her own foster sister mila who loves her best i can only fathom making the choice to give up everything that you've ever known everyone that you've ever loved to have the freedom to live your own life of course this is doubly significant because that is exactly what the author anouk markovits has chosen to do i can only hope with happier consequences i found it strange that about midway through the book we suddenly lose atara as though the book is actually written and told by only what mila knows she disappears from the pages as symbolically as she has disappeared from her family and her religion when we see her again as a very old lady it appears that she has continued to live a life of solitude and emptiness which is incredibly depressing to think to lay that depression on a deeper one when mila's granddaughter judith discovers the truth it is heart wrenching the choices that lay in front of her because of her lack of freedom are appalling a sin that she did not commit leads her to commit the worse possible in the judaic religion it's horrifying and what sympathy i had for the sectarian religion was hard to maintain after that point it also takes a bit to get into it i have studied the monotheistic religions for many years including doing doctoral level classes in early judaism so thankfully i had a lot of knowledge off of which i could work but i wonder if the general lay reader would understand a lot of the rituals and terminology behind the satmar sect i'm thankful to get a chance to learn just a little bit more about it","444":"beautifully written on a subject culture religion i do not know or understand the story was compelling crossing decades and continents with exquisite female and male characters if you want to part the curtains and look into the world of jewish fundamentalism this book is perfect because while it is very short it carries an amazing punch","445":"mesmerizing it's not a simple read but the story is beautifully told loved ot","446":" written by a woman who left her hasidic home to dodge an arranged marriage comes the tender family saga spanning 4 generations centered around orphan girl mila and her adoptive sister atara daughter to a zealous satmar leader although both girls are imbued in the same lifestyle and traditions as mila's heart grows nearer to her faith and atara's grows more distant after mila the elder of the two consents to an arranged marriage atara runs away to avoid her similar impending fate from the point instead of following atara in the fashion of a loose memoire of the author the story follows the sister who stays mila mila through her wedding night mila through her childless marriage to the orphan boy who saved her as a child and whom she loves dearly mila though her desperation to conceive and through the lengths she goes to achieve a child a lineage all leading her back to the astranged atara many many years later this is a touching human insight into the hasidic faith and community and more broadly how heritage and traditions shapes each person differently","447":"loved this book interesting prospective of women living the hasidic jewish life they are taught to accept and to not question the very strict laws of the religion this book follows the lives of two women one who tries to live the life the other who questions too much and breaks away a great read","448":"heart wrenching look at the pain of religion an intimate look at a strict hasidic sect of judaism and the impact on a jewish family that survived wwii hard to read and not be affected hard to put down","449":"beautifully written","450":"ugh this book was so mellow dramatic rehashing we'll tread ground very one sided view of chasidism","451":"the story starts out with developed characters but becomes sketchy at the end","452":"an absolute gem of a book i cannot praise it enough this book is the perfect intersection of beautiful prose and interesting subject matter on top of that i learned so much from this book i found myself googling different terms after every chapter i became so engrossed in this book it's one of the best i've read in a long time","453":"i enjoyed this but felt the narrative unbalanced to a frustrating degree the command of the writing faltered at the end under the melodrama","454":"i initially read the first 50 pages or so of this book i was bored and there was nothing going on so i stopped after some time i saw that the magazine entertainment weekly had recommended the book i don't always take their opinions to heart but my interests and the writers' interests usually sync up so i decided to give the book another shot so i read and read and read and read and nothing happened there were a few interesting plot points but those did not occur until after page 200 and even when something did occur she dragged it on and on and on and on i really don't why i'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 but i guess it's because i did find the one interesting plot point somewhat intriguing however i do not recommend this book for anyone anywhere boring really boring zzzzzz oh yeah i won this book in a goodreads first reads giveaways contest","455":"i was so lost and confused through this book wasn't interesting at least it was a quick read","456":"the author brings and unusual perspective to the book she is a former szatmar writing about the szatmars i found the story not terribly well written but it was an interesting experiment in terms of getting into the minds of a community which is not easy to access the rules about sex and courtship were quite interesting","457":"it's an interesting read about the complexities of living life as a hassidic jew it's a quick intense read but i found myself very drawn to the characters","458":"it was okay hard to identify with some of the characters who are too wimpy some gaps in the narrative as well i generally love wwii set books but this was not one of my faves","459":"interesting story told with compassion","460":"anouk markovitz is going to produce a great novel someday i am forbidden isn't a great novel the last hundred pages unfolded like a lifetime movie even religious extremists are capable of making compromises seeing shades of gray and making the best of things with that said i found i am forbidden compulsively readable and i raced through it in a couple of days i do really look forward to other books by this author","461":"a heart rending study of the hasidic culture","462":"this was a very different book for me i was intrigued by the plot but i must confess i had some trouble following the story this was due to my unfamiliarity with the satmar sect of judaism not being jewish this world was totally new to me the story traces the lives of two families from this sect from romania to paris to new york from world war ii to the paris student riots in the 60s to the present day complex and at times moving","463":"fictitious account of two sisters in the enclosed jewish chassidic satmar community one of whom leaves the other remains devout a respectful examination of the community by the french author who used to belong to it","464":" i loved this book it tells the story of a religion that you hardly ever read about especially in a novel and it does that in a beautifully written tale about a young hasidic couple who escape the holocaust beginning just before wwii in romania it takes you all the way to williamsburg brooklyn in 2012 this is written by anouk markovits a woman born into a satmar home in france who herself left the fold and wrote this amazing book it is her first written in english and i am curious to see what she writes next","465":"an unexpectedly good read i can't remember why i added this book to my to read shelf as i knew very little about it but i'm glad i did the author grew up in the satmar community in paris and left at 19 so the autobiographical details are quite gripping it's clear where she stands on the fundamentalism of the community but she still manages to create heartbreakingly sympathetic characters","466":"i found the first 50 pages of this book very hard to follow and had to re read the author has a very fragmented way of writing i eventually got used to it i learned a lot about the satmar religion so i don't completely regret reading this i just feel sad for the entire family but at the same time it's eye opening that people could be so devoted to their beliefs and follow them so strictly","467":"gosh serious stuff","468":"an excellent book but i could not enjoy it because it made me so angry and so wounded a religious community in which legalism and control outweigh faith and love is the ugliest thing","469":"more like 2 5 stars this was obviously written by someone with a bone to pick with the hasidim as with any fervent sect the hasidim follow a number of what seem to be particularly from the outside goofy rules and a cult like devotion to their rebbe and the ultimate outcome in this book is unhappiness in many quarters nonetheless it's always interesting to have an insight into a closed society","470":" this book a very powerful read and pulled me in from the very beginning this intimate look at the tragedy of the holocaust from the perspective of two families was moving and engrossing i eagerly followed the story of josef mila and atara as they grew to adulthood hoping that all would be well for these people who so desperately deserved some happiness it is hard to explain my concerns with the novel without giving away too much of the plot but essentially halfway through the book one of the main characters disappeared from the narrative not to re emerge for decades because atara dropped away form the story i was left feeling that the story was incomplete josef and mila's tale is tragic and compelling but i wanted also to learn about how atara dealt with the choices she made i was also dissatisfied with the end of the book which was just too bleak for me well written and compelling this story was nonetheless incomplete for me","471":"this is a heart wrenching story that shows us the meaning of family l","472":"i enjoy books that not only are a good escape but also where new worlds are opened to me different ways to live and even better teach me a little history this book did all of the above i am prompted to learn more about hasidic jews after reading this book in one way it must be a comfort to have an ordered life but having been raised and living in relative freedom i could now not live in such a strict and paternalistic society","473":" 3 5 i love when books can take me to some place that i haven't been before before this book i was not familiar with the satmar sect of judaism a very conservative sect that really limits what women in the sect are able to do women are supposed to be almost subservient to their husbands at all times they don't hold a lot of power it was interesting to get a glimpse of what it must be like to be in that world it's also very interesting that the author grew up in a sect much like the one mila finds herself living in later on in the book once she marries josef the author obviously left the sect and has been out of the sect for awhile as she would have never been able to have written a book like this one while remaining a part of the sect standing at under 300 pages this book that covers from wwii to the present day moves very quickly and sometimes too quickly for my own liking while i do like books that move quickly i found myself wishing that the author would dwell a little bit longer and explain some things i found myself having to look up a lot about the satmar sect as it was totally unfamiliar to me and i didn't want to miss anything in the book i thought that the author really had three stories here that she could have written a book about each the first story being about josef's adoptive mother and his childhood and ultimately being taken in by another satmar family the second being about mila's life in williamsburg the third being about mila's grandchildren all of these stories could have included enough detail to make really full stories because the book moves so quickly it's almost as if you are looking through a window at the characters but you don't really get to know what's going on inside of the characters heads to me this was both a bonus and a detriment it's a detriment because i really wanted to know why the characters were thinking what they were thinking it was a bonus because the writing is so crisp and fresh that the sort of sparseness of detail doesn't really detract and allows the writing to really shine through bottom line a very interesting historical fiction that covers a lot of ground","474":"for me too tough put the book down every half hour i wanted to further my knowledge about the elusive hasidic culture and ended up with a scrunched up face doing a lot of head shaking the writing is brilliant but not a book i could hand you saying you gotta read this","475":"beautifully written and fascinating story of a young women growing up as a satmar hasidic jew","476":"i liked this so much more than i expected to also it was such a nice change from all the ya fiction i've been reading lately such a fascinating look at another religion and how the choices we make affect others","477":" while i wasn't drawn into the novel because of markovits' writing style i was drawn into how this fictional family's story illustrates the intolerance and divisiveness of religious fanaticism i suspect that markovits modeled the character of atara on her own experiences that character was by far the most interesting of all and her development provided depth i would have liked to have learned more about how her character continued to develop but she was absent from a good part of the later chapters i appreciated learning about the traditions rituals and rationale of the satmar hasidic sect i hope to learn more about the author and her decision making process to take the paths she chose","478":"i personally couldn't put it down once the story started culturally insightful especially as a jewish woman well written","479":"i enjoyed this book because it raised many emotions i learned a lot about the satmar part of the jewish religion and it was quite interesting another male run religion that strives to keep the females uneducated and isolated","480":"an interesting read the beginning jumps around a little bit but the storyline and characters quickly draw you in to the book personal values and religious beliefs conflict as secrets threaten to destroy those we love","481":"author took a different tack from others writing about hasidic jew leaving the community the main character is the young woman who stays the narrator the one who leaves the author left room for the reader to respond to situations within the society i appreciated that freedom the book also revealed interesting personal customs between husband and wife interesting book i hope the writer continues to write not necessarily on the same subject i think she was in control of the story","482":"i am forbidden by anouk markovitsthis novel elicited a few different and emotional reactions from me first of all i had some difficulty following the plot initially i believe due to my unfamiliarity with the history and the foreign to me names the beauty of the writing paired with my personal beliefs caused the varied emotional responses initially i felt increased compassion for the characters and increased understanding of the hasidic experience as the story continued i experienced anger about the way the characters in this religious community treated each other and women i hope that my increased compassion will win out but it may take some time i think the behavior that bothered me was probably due to their own experiences of trauma some of those experience seem to me to be almost impossible to overcome and yet many did i'm sure they fared much better than i would it is also interesting to think of how different my personal reaction would be at different points of time right now i'm a little tired of hearing women put down daily in the news so don't have much patience for it in my reading this book is an interesting and i believe realistic look at the development of religious beliefs based on life experiences in addition to time and place of birth if you are interested in that topic or in jewish history i highly recommend it i learned a lot this was my first win from the read it forward program","483":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i suppose i'm a bit confused by the high ratings on this book perhaps my problem with the book lies with my own personal questions about religion the novel explores a very religious sect of the jewish faith while i found that interesting and the journey of the family it follows from wwii to america i had a hard time understanding why the family could have been so torn apart because of the laws of their religion and how the same religion could lead to such a horrible tragedy at the end of t i suppose i'm a bit confused by the high ratings on this book perhaps my problem with the book lies with my own personal questions about religion

could have been so torn apart because of the laws of their religion and how the same religion could lead to such a horrible tragedy at the end of the book i'll recommend this one for those looking to explore the jewish faith but by no means is this a wwii historical novel and it most certainly does not have a happy ending more","484":"this is another interesting book about how people's extreme religious views can cause effects to ripple through generations m y","485":"i am forbidden was a quick fascinating appetizer to the mysterious world of hasidic judaism it begins during the nazi purge of the jews in world war ii in eastern europe when two hasidic children are orphaned and then rescued by zalman stern who controls their upbringing and eventually brings them together again as young adults mila heller the little girl is brought up in zalman's family and becomes very close to his daughter atara their relationship is well drawn in the novel when they are sent to a seminary in england for their schooling their lives begin to diverge as atara becomes increasingly disillusioned by the strict rules and confines of her religion while mila enjoys the easier road of acceptance and belonging when zalman has arranged a marriage for atara she rebels but mila easily accepts her young man who turns out to be the other orphan josef lichtenstein this marriage takes mila to the williamsburg section of brooklyn new york where josef has spent years relearning his hasidic background interrupted by the war through the deep study it demands to become a true believer like mila he has taken it on board very seriously and does not want to veer from its strict way of life this rigidity eventually causes them both much suffering i refer to this book as an appetizer because it began so many interesting threads and story lines that it somewhat neglected in order to focus on mila and josef's tragedy and even that felt rushed as markovits whipped through the years of their unhappiness and suffering i think the point of her book was to show how the rigidity of the hasidic way of life leaves no room for a major problem when one arises there are basically two choices leave like atara and remain excommunicated and estranged from your family and loved ones forever or stay and suffer silently like jacob and mila with tragic results","486":"the story begins in 1939 transylvania at the start of ww11and travels from that time and place to paris manhattan and williamsburg ny to the present day it is the story of the satmar sect the most insular or narrow minded off shoot of hasidic sect of judaism two daughters one atara who breaks with the traditions of satmar and the other mila who stays only to have a childless marriage this was a hard book to read but i am glad that i did and i do believe it is an important book the rules that the people had to live by are unbelievable by any standards far to many for me write about however for them it was necessary and as much as i might think it wrong they do deserve to live in peace i do wish the origin of their traditions had been explained in more depth some might find this book to far fetched to be true however after reading the book i did some homework on wikipedia and also talked to a close friend who is jewish and learned that everything in the book regarding life in the satmar sect is true this was a very worthwhile read","487":"really more like 2 5 i read this book for my book club it's not a book that i would have ever picked up to read on my own the mini chapters made the book a very quick read the book was well written i think the biggest reason why i didn't connect with this book is that i didn't really understand what was going on most of the time because i don't know very much about very strict jewish traditions most of the book concerns older strict interpretations of jewish traditions and laws that i am not familiar with so i couldn't really appreciate the magnitude of what the author was trying to say i mean on one level i understood that the characters were very traditional and followed the religious ways to the letter so when people didn't follow the rules it was a big deal but i think a lot of the nuances was probably lost on me","488":" i loved this book for many reasons 1 explores the tensions between authentic selfhood and connection with others2 evocative and restrained writing about passionate yet restrained characters 3 historical fiction for me always piques my interest to learn more about places times and situations it would otherwise never occur to me to study4 beautifully explores the tensions in religious life how separate should we be what prices are we willing to pay for the gifts of tight community what do we do when our devotion to god and religious ideals lead us to challenge that very same devotion and related ethics and ideas 5 presents one expression of fundamentalist faith in a candid challenging but not unsympathetic light","489":" i was so sorrowful for the characters in this book women forced to live in shame and fear as hasidic jews lately i've been extremely interested in religion as a subject and have watched a few documentaries and such on the dangers of these cult like sects i'm left with an overwhelming sadness at the missed opportunities and the self inflicted hatred when someone doesn't live up to these religious standards i did find the writing a little difficult to follow i had to re read several passages to find out exactly what was going on but the plot was extremely compelling and i appreciate the insight it provided into this lifestyle","490":"first and foremost i was glad this book had a glossary this novel gives an interesting look into the world of hasidic jews being from a rural area i am unfamiliar with of this branch of judaism the book was a little hard to follow in the beginning but quickly turned into an eye opening look into this world of many rules and unfamiliar laws both mila and atera's characters were relate able each had feelings that one can see in oneself i will definitely be sharing this book with others","491":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book i can't quite figure out how i feel about it at some points it is literally fascinating to see what jews believe and how literal they are in the things they do to follow the law at times it is heartbreaking in that mila feels that she has to go and get seed from someone other than her husband to be able to have a child after 10 years and that she explains that away from a specific scripture what is more heartbreaking is that atara the daughter that moves away from judaism this book i can't quite figure out how i feel about it at some points it is literally fascinating to see what jews believe and how literal they are in the things they do to follow the law at times it is heartbreaking in that mila feels that she has to go and get seed from someone other than her husband to be able to have a child after 10 years and that she explains that away from a specific scripture what is more heartbreaking is that atara the daughter that moves away from judaism is lost to her family and that judith the granddaughter of mila once she finds out she is not true jew she commits suicide this book kept me reading if only to find out if eventually someone would find out about what mila did it did make me think about my own beliefs and what if anything would cause me to believe them the ending was just sad though just sad more","492":" i loved this book the story is brutal but it's told with beautiful storytelling readers with a strong religious background might see this book through a different prism than i do but through my secular eyes i couldn't help but feel horrible for all the kids in this book it seemed like they just couldn't catch a break from all the religious zealots in their lives i saw it as a feminist's unflinching examination of the hasidic community with a focus on two sisters one girl 'drinks the water ' so to speak and embraces the religion even going so far as to report her periods to her rabbi so that he can tell her when she's allowed to have sex creepy the other sister breaks free of the confines of the religion and embraces knowledge u0026amp learning instead guess which sister i related to the most","493":"this account of the satmar community in france after ww2 was probably a good representation of the times people were running and trying to find places to hide some people returned to their traditions and others broke away the book illustrates the struggles that occurred during the time period the characters were enjoyable and the writing was also","494":"a nov elized version of a strict multi generational satmar community weak in every way but if accurate does provide some insight into the way things work written by someone who left at 19","495":"this was very beautifully done","496":"great book","497":"excellent yet disturbing read that i couldn't put down a very authentic and insightful look into the satmar sect of hasidic judaism anouk markovitzs' brilliant writing captures the essence of this community i highly recommend it","498":"this is a stunningly detailed insight into the life of a hasid despite living in israel i had not know that for the religious jew to be saved by the zionists was unacceptable and still is i suppose the intricacies of character motivation and belief have great breadth and depth the impact of events and the manner of creating acceptance for acts is amazing the writing has an unerring engagement that drew me into reading it almost without pause","499":"this book started with so much promise i really enjoyed the first few chapters of the book as i learned about hassidic jews and their legalistic mentality it starts out during the holocaust as i hear about the life of jews in transylvania the story seems to be about a boy and girl who meet by chance with both of their parents dead they help each other out and then the story starts to be only about the girl i felt like i invested into the character of josef but then he disappears for awhile and i never truly feel compelled to like or care for him when he returns i actually start to hate the characters and how the author jumps years so quickly the foster sister also seemed like a likable character and then disappears to appear only at the end she has this different life but yet i have no idea how she survived after running away i felt cheated i invested in 3 characters and never felt like they were fully formed and then boom we get to the end i liked the fact that it wasn't an everything is all right ending but i didn't understand why the author jumped there when there was so much more story to tell i wouldn't read it","500":"beautiful unusual and moving every time i put the book down i couldn't wait to return to the characters one of my favorites of the year","501":"very interesting look into the lives of the ultra orthodox a bit slow and definitely not an uplifting read but character relationships were very real","502":"read it for a book club but not what i would call an enjoyable read","503":"disappointing no likable characters really a negative view of the hasidim i wish i hadn t read this book and i would recommend all my friends avoid it i can find you a much better book about ultra religious jews read jerusalem maiden instead","504":"i read this book because i enjoy historical fiction the first 1 2 of the book certainly read more like historic fiction because i don't know much about hasidic jews or their history i was often confused and didn't always follow certain parts but 1 2 way through the story the historical fiction genre takes back seat to a plot line that seemed awkward and out of place i lost interest in the book at that point and forced myself to finish it i was very disappointed with the ending","505":"just couldn't feel the characters not enough depth","506":"this book took me into a world that i knew little about an ultra orthodox jewish hasidic sect while addressing how some of their laws were interpreted and the impact on families as a result it was the strong emotions between family members that drew me in a very real very sad book although some light does shine in","507":" josef is a young boy when he survives the massacre of his family in transylvania during world war ii hidden and raised by a non jewish woman for several years josef is

and raised in paris thus begins i am forbidden by anouk markovits eventually josef and mila satmar jews will marry and entwine their lives together in new york their peace and security in this insular hasidic sect is threatened by a secret they will keep for generations markovits writing is abstract and illusive and at the beginning of the novel my background with the history of transylvania and hungary during world war ii was not significant enough for me to fully grasp what was happening i did a little research on my own and found that it helped in the understanding of the novel it was not long into the novel before i was completely entranced by the story and characters i couldn't put the novel down and i was literally weeping for mila and her struggles with infertility her desperate act and the ultimate consequences i am forbidden is a heart breaking novel that follows generations through pain death love and joy while the novel opens a window on this intriguing and secluded group of people the novel is ultimately about human desire which is of course universal","508":"this book was upsetting to read hard to imagine living under those conditions","509":"an intense look into the hasidic jewish community their commitment to their beliefs is clearly related and admirable the book is written in a very jolted manner as it covers a large passage of time u0026amp generations not an easy read","510":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits hogarth isbn 9781781090022traditional religious laws have the ability to both create and break bonds of love in transylvania during the final days

beautiful poetic writing a special and rewarding read josine overdevest rating 4 5www writerswrite co za","511":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'm so glad this is a work of fiction reading this book hurt my heart spoiler the idea that having a child trumps fidelity or that suicide trumps being a mamzer and not marrying the guy your parents found for you is sickening","512":" i really found this book to be emotional and it really pulled me in it made me think about what life could be like in a different culture or religion i found it to be very interesting it explained some aspects of the hasidic jewish faith and how the people were treated during world war ii it was a wonderful story that made me feel for the characters in the book it starts out in world war ii with the jews being taken on trains to the concentration camps there was the story of the boy who watched his whole family be murdered in front of him then the maid took him away from there and turned him into a christian he is found by the jewish people again and taken to america to study with the rabbi there is marriage to a young jewish girl from the family who found the boy they cannot have children and then things get interesting to tell more would give away too much of the ending this book gave a bit of history of world war ii as well as the perspective of a jewish family and how they survive i found the book to be very interesting and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good book it will draw in the reader and make them feel like they are a part of the story i really enjoyed reading this book even though parts of it made me cry","513":"wonderful book about the cruel laws against the mamzerim children born out of forbidden relationships however i wonder if the claim that the satmar rebbe was given special privilege to escape the nazis was real","514":"i wanted this to be so much more it opened beautifully then just sped through 40 years i felt pretty cheated","515":"story of two jewish girls one taken in after her parents are killed and the other the daughter of those who took her in one turns her back on her religion the other follows the strict jewish laws but does something that could destroy her family for generations to come and her secret causes a tragedy interesting look into jewish life","516":"a disturbing portrait of the satmar community unfortunately i think a pretty accurate one the prose is beautiful though","517":"picked it up at the library on saturday and read it all day until i finished emotional story","518":"the first 100 pages were slow then it got interesting then began to bore me again","519":"this book should u0026amp will be the classic book about satmar hasidimthis book is written with a pen of a scholar yet it is from a women who was shunned like the character in the book atara only when you arrive at the end of the book you see it is indeed a true story so how in the world could a human be so eloquent and not let her rage and agony show thru the author and atara her main charterer have so much understanding for her tormentor her father mother and family that forsake and told her she is forbidden that she must be god herself no humane can contain such mastery of hiding your own personal feelings instead of raw pain you get historic contest of the nature of those satmar beats in humane flesh secrefisicng your own child for an imagined god a true biblical fantasy that this author writes with her own blood yet its simple witnesses statements of true events wow how could she face such evil done to her and treat it with such caring to tell u0026amp explain the side of her enemy what drove them to kill her its as if the ghosts of auschwitz and treblinka would be the lawyers of nazis and hitler she articulates satmar hasidic fervent fantasism in such glowing understanding colors that educates all about what stamar is and why they succeed in thriving in the midst on nyc modernity a classic read for generations to come from the bowls of the devil from non other of a child who was shunned abandoned and lived to tell the story of her life with a dignified loving smile simply astonishing","520":"the book is well done the topic distressing there is no way for this to be happy ending with all the events involved sad but true","521":" i am mystified by meandering rivers i've never seen one in person but i've seen photos and these have grabbed my attention part of what makes these rivers so beautiful are their wide arcs back and forth if you were on any point of one of these rivers you'd see things differently you might at first think the river that flowed parallel to yours was a different river that would eventually merge with your own much in the same way i am forbidden meanders through scenery that is beautiful heading for a destination that seems clear one moment then changes zoom out and you'll find a story that looks similar to this river a story that goes this way then that it's more than 2 3 of the way through the novel before the story--the real story at the heart of this novel--begins to come into focus some will see this as poor planning others may see it as the writer's style or maybe they'll propose an underlying theme in the drifting story i'm not sure why markovits covered such a broad range in a novel that could have been much more focused but it's not something your average writer would undertake to be clear i am forbidden has a focal point in a small cast of characters but the places they go the events they experience so much of it doesn't seem necessary to the story itself so in my opinion it may be a little too easy for a reader to scratch their head for more than 200 pages and think \"where is this story going \" and for some readers that sort of thinking may mean putting the book aside for an indefinite period of time once the story becomes clear however it does stay focused it's a good story and the insight it gives the reader into a hasidic jewish family makes it well worth it it is a heartbreaking story but i think had more time been spent with these last hundred pages it would've been much more affective the farther from the story i move the less memorable it becomes","522":" four generations of a satmar hasidic family from 1939 in transylvania to 2012 in williamsburg ny in each and in some there are multiple members who believe themselves to be \"forbidden \" one young man has nocturnal emissions one young woman is intellectually curious she knows that she will have to leave her community to continue learning and never see her parents again her adopted sister from a family that was murdered by the nazis goes to great extremes to conceive and the biggest secret of them all is one that many in the greater world knows but the satmar hasidim do not according to this book the satmar rebbe joel tietlebaum who refused israel and zionism all his life was secreted out of bergen belsen with his family and some allies by a zionist to switzerland then he allowed the zionist to be executed as a nazi sympathizer i quite enjoyed this novel and its characters while i haven't recently read chaim potok comparisons to his novels are apt i received this from the publisher through read it forward on 3 27 12","523":"this is an absolutely gorgeously written novel about the lives of two women who grow up as sisters in a hasidic household the story begins during ww ii in transylvania and takes us all the way to the present in williamsburg brooklyn the author presents the story in a very non judgmental way although there is so much heartbreak from following the jewish letter of the law the hard life of female in this community is depicted in a way that also uncovers the profound joy of this religious life","524":"very beautiful but sad i found the writing fairly straight forward but descriptive and bright until the last section of the book after the tragedy apart ness is revealed at that point it fades and feels rushed i don't know if it's because it is the part that covers a part of satmar hassidic life that the author was not privy to as she left before she entered into marriage or because of the way that the timeline is accelerated however the rest of the book is startlingly passionate and beautiful as a read","525":"this book was interesting i did learn a lot about the satmar sect of hasidic jews it was an emotionally difficult read for me though because of the laws rules beliefs of satmar which seem so very strict and rigid of course i respect their beliefs and respect the adherence to their beliefs the plot was heartbreaking","526":"this excellent book immerses the reader in the insular world of a satmar jewish family the story follows the family through several generations with a strong emphasis on the women of the family reading this book was an uncanny experience in the true sense of that word so much of what was being described was somewhat familiar because of my own background in a judeo christian faith and my reading about some very conservative sects of judaism but on the other hand there were moments i felt i could have been reading about people from mars so alien was the life being described faith plays a pivotal role to the character's lives defining the rules of every aspect of everyday conduct from dress to food to interactions with other members of the family at times it was easy to see how this routine brought great comfort but there were other moments where i became frustrated with the rules and the pain they caused one moment that leaps to mind is when mila returns home to her family in france and her younger brother wants to hug her having not seen her for a number of years but is forbidden to even touch her because he has come of age and been through the formal rituals of manhood and he cannot touch a woman not his wife how sad and how difficult for a young boy he is about 13 14 i believe to understand i think the good and the bad were evenly balanced as the author also showed the strong sense of community and tradition and the comfort this brought to the characters i was particularly interested in the heavy burden placed on the women as far as purity and maintaining family purity in a never ending series of rituals to make them \"clean\" after such normal events as childbirth menstruation or even passing a dog on the street if they failed to follow the rules exactly they could defile their husbands or even render their children unclean this seemed absurdly harsh yet i can also see the beauty in ritual and the prayerful thought that underlay so many of these behaviors overall this was a powerful and memorable read about group i knew little about though the story of the culture and history of these people may have been more compelling than the more personal story of mila and atara which was meant to be the focus","527":"enthralling agonizing and infuriating it took me about 24 hours to read this astonishingly affecting novel and i cried and muttered oaths a lot during that time","528":"more interesting than entertaining follows a young boy from the end of ww2 through the rest of his life as he navigates post war europe then the us as a hasidic jew quite a bit of tragedy and sadness throughout i'm wondering if the 3rd person narrator also puts me off","529":"i really did not care much for this book which is a shame because i was really looking forward to reading it i thought it was choppy and all over the place i almost stopped after 100 pages in but kept going there were a lot of different stories going on and i didn't think any of them were developed really well except for the story of mila and josef's marriage challenges confusing and choppy","530":"this was one of those books that i couldn't put down i never became enthralled with any one character but watching a group of people progress together and apart was the biggest draw this book reminded me of 'plainsong' in many ways but without the soul surging feeling that i get when i read 'plainsong' still a good read though","531":"an interesting read but it felt like there wasn't a lot of story i would have almost rather read a non fiction account","532":"markovits' novel her debut in english is astounding the story kept my interest and now that i'm finished i can't stop thinking about it if you are unfamiliar with the culture she includes a glossary of terms however her word choice is so precise that glossary may not be necessary","533":"a rich deep story despite its small page count a fascinatinating insight into the world of the devout jew","534":"really interesting look at the satmar group of hasidic jews i particularly liked looking at both sides of a religion with a fairly strict set of rules for some the rules are a comfort for others the rules can be so binding as to cause tragedy","535":" this novel provides a harrowing look into the rarely glimpsed fold of the hasidic jewish community it is brutally honest with a prose that is bare and cold enough to give the novel a real sense of despair the author is obviously very gifted in her craft she uses the simplest sentences to get her point across in a way that the most florid descriptions never would at the beginning the writing seemed chopped and too hurried but as i accustomed myself to it i learned to see the bare beauty of it the storylines and there are a few are all mixed together going back and forth in time although not enough to confuse the reader there are a few characters to keep straight but their personalities shine through enough to make this much easier than it would've been otherwise it's not an easy book to read however mainly because there is such a sense of lost hope pretty much with all characters that it gets heavy the restrictions in this orthodox branch of the jewish religion are astoundingly cruel and they will definitely leave an impression in the reader i highly recommend this book not only as a window into this community but also as a wonderful example of a deep lyrical work of fiction","536":" this is not a book to take with you in case you have time to kill while waiting for the bus it deserves complete attention and in the first couple of chapters it needs it if you aren't familiar with orthodox judaism or the old testament then even with the glossary the first two or three chapters will probably prove hard going but it's more than worth the effort of sticking with it the connections between the apparently disconnected events become clear and the book becomes more about humanity than about religion but as the story progresses they collide with tragic results for both the irresistible forces of romantic and family relationships hit the immovable object of tradition and fundamentalism i did try reading the last section while at work mistake book versus work the book nearly won i was expecting an emotional ending which it was but the final events were not what i'd anticipated the prose and the characters dripped with a colour and richness that i haven't come across in a book for several years a thoughtful and thought provoking read","537":" originally reviewed at jayne's books first heard about this book through one of the many of the book blogs that i follow and was intrigued about the concept of the book i think what interested me in the book was the fact that it spanned many decades and the consequences of that rebellion what kept me reading this book was the fact that i was intrigued as to how the story ended up and what exactly was forbidden i was also intrigued as to how the cover played into the story which it does by the way and you'll have to read it in order to find out how it does it is also interesting into seeing how the two sister's paths diverge and what the consequences of that decision was","538":"great coming of age story set in a world we rarely see in ya fiction","539":"i read this book in one day loved the characters and looked forward to knowing what happened to them","540":"this book is excellently written and is a good reminder how we should never follow any historical public or religious figure blindly especially when they have pointed areas they forbid us from or subjects they hedge from discussing it also opens the lens in what it is like to live in a community that is very strict in its religious practice and while many grow up in this faith and find comfort in it there are always some that desire more than this community can offer and the very brave step and heart rending sacrifice it takes to break from it finally it touches on the tragic consequences those who remain in the faith can pay","541":"good insight into the hasidic branch of judaism well written the characters are well developed almost a 4 star book","542":"not having had any experience at all in the jewish community i found this story very difficult to follow like it was written in a different language which in fact much of it was even as i struggled to make sense of the foreign culture and language though i didn't realize there was a glossary at the end of the book until i came to the end of the book a point that became very clear to me was the universal struggle of maintaining customs and beliefs in a world where personal freedom is the predominant ideology a true treasure of a novel that encouraged me to think about these choices","543":"markovits' english language debut is unlike any book you've ever read unless perhaps you've been a member of the hasidic sect the satmar otherwise she is introducing the secular world as referred to in her novel to a religious life many of us are not privy to beginning at the end of the second world war josef lichtenstein and mila heller's families are violently murdered in two unrelated anti jewish events forever changed by these events the two children's lives will cross for only a moment before josef is adopted by a catholic woman who conceals his religious identity and mila is taken in by a conservative rabbi and his family when the jewish faith once again envelopes both of these young people their lives will cross again in young adulthood and culminate in a final tragedy that remains a family secret for nearly fifty years if the premise sounds engaging it is and markovits does not baby her audience she knows that we know little of the world she describes and makes you go along for the ride rather than slow down and explain needless to say markovits' own personal struggle she left the sect at the age of 19 comes through loud and clear in every aspect of her story mila's adopted sister finds it difficult to immerse herself in the satmar lifestyle after a life changing event of her own and mila's devout faith is tested by the most heart breaking of circumstances many years later this novel is a true exploration of religion's ability to heal and to devastatingly hurt the ending struck me as just slightly theatrical after the course of the story has already played out but that is only a small critique this novel forced me to explore a new world and revisit an old struggle with religion i have lived my whole life but in a new way what more can you ask for","544":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits is the june book of the month that our book club picked to read i really enjoyed reading this book the story starts during world war ii in transylvania josef lichtenstein a five year old jewish boy witnessed the murder of his family by the romanian iron guard he was hiding under the table josef is rescued by florina a gentile maid who worked for josefs family she takes him home with her and starts to raise him as her own son about five years later josef rescues a young girl mila heller who's parents were killed running after a train to meet the rebbe they hoped could save them josef takes mila to zelman stern he is the leader in the satmar community zelman takes mila in and raises her with his daughter atara as the girls get older milas faith increases atara discovers a world of books she is not permitted to look at or read atara cannot ignore reading and learning with the rise of communism zelman stern moves his family to paris i will not go into detail about the rest of the story but to let you know their is alot of history and strict religion i would recommend this book to anybody from high school up","545":"an interesting and sad novel about a hassidic family from transylvania then paris and the us one daughter leaves the sect the author drops her story fairly abruptly though it seems from the book jacket description that this is her own story very quick read though nothing spectacular about the writing","546":"i was given this book to review and found myself unable to put it down though the story was a little depressing it was very compelling the characters are relatable and the storyline was well developed","547":"this was a quick read and while the subject matter interests me i wasn't enamored with the writing style the author's staccato cadence made the story very choppy i felt for the characters at the beginning but it lost a lot of steam along the way","548":" an unusual interesting but very sad novel written in highly poetic language two young children a boy and a girl witness from their hiding places the murder of their families during the holocaust in transylvania their lives briefly intersect as the somewhat older boy helps the girl find safety with another family later their lives are joined again in the jewish community in williamsburg brooklyn new york it is an illuminating story of the high costs associated with life in an isolated highly legalistic jewish sect it sheds light on the difficult complex moral choices members of such a sect must make but it doesn't quite rise to the level of say chaim potok's the chosen which i would recommend for a fuller appreciation of the complexity of those choices","549":" this is a story of an orthodox jewish from wwi to present it is focused very carefully on these individuals and does not try to tell a broader story some of the background information is factual the author left such a family to avoid an arranged marriage so it is to be expected that she has a bias even so there were many details of that lifestyle that i found interesting and had not known before the story itself is enough to pull one in and there are questions that beg to be answered for instance just where does religion end and love of family begin i enjoyed this book and would recommend it","550":"kind of dark and depressing but i learned a lot and did enjoy it","551":"this is a book that enters another world it spans many generations and is sometimes a challenge to look at from a 21st century perspective the jewish hasidic sect of the orthodox jews is very pious and follows the torah and its teachings to the letter they adhere to the word of god and the traditions written during the time of moses and the prophets exclusively they adhere to the high holy days and follow the code of the place of women their adherence to the ancient laws are to be admired these laws have never been altered throughout the centuries even though civilization has modernized and changed the laws are still followed exclusively when mila was permitted to go to a physician i was surprised that her husband complied for her health it was a good thing but he was forbidden to seek the same guidance although i don't always agree with their ways i admire them and feel the laws and traditions they adhere to are actually the word of god i feel they should be able to live according to their beliefs and that no one should deny or persecute them i learned so much from this novel and am grateful to the author anouk markovits for writing it i read a lot of history and historical fiction to broaden my understanding of different cultures and their traditions books such as this bring the characters to life and make us as readers know that they aren't that much different in the way they handles life's complexities thank you ms markovits for broadening my perspective and enriching my life","552":"this was my book club's choice for february i think it will generate a lot of good discussion i thought the book was good but i didn't find it hard to put down until i was 50% of the way through before i got to that point i was certainly interested in the details of the characters' lives but it was something i had to encourage myself to get back to reading this was chosen by a history professor who had already read it so i'm taking a guess that it's historically accurate it discusses a religious group of people with which i am unfamiliar the rituals and rules to which these people were expected to adhere were fascinating especially in regards to the women and girls i'm not super fond of novels that span generations so that may have been why it was difficult for me to engage once i felt comfortable with a character the book either switched viewpoints to another character or the time period jumped forward or both because of this i probably wouldn't have chosen to read this book on my own that being said i'm glad i did that's one of the great benefits of a book club","553":" this book reinforces my critique of organized religion in general as patriarchal and takes it to another level i remain steadfast in my conviction that religion should not be equated with a healthy spiritual life the story unfolds over time and several generations to remind us of the jewish diaspora we watch two women sisters by choice not biology choose very divergent paths born in the satmar tradition they are raised to be wives and mothers but what happens when one cannot conceive when a woman defines herself through the offspring she bears or this book did not shock me but i did call my parents and thank them for not raising me in this particular faith i am left with images of a romania whose synagogues host dust and ghosts of its anti semitic past","554":" although the writing style was a little difficult to read through at times all in all i thought it was a great book because of the fascinating story it told of a hassidic jewish family and 2 children whose parents are murdered as part of anti semitism acts the story starts out in transylvania in 1939 moves to paris and ends in the brooklyn new york in current time the author has woven a fictional account around actual historic events and people markovits takes the reader into the very heart and soul of the characters josef and mila who struggle with passionate desires and beliefs that clash and face tragic loss markovitz provides an intimate view of how their beliefs permeate every facet of life i found this book to be very intense and thought provoking in many ways","555":"fascinating fascinating fascinating a peek into a world culture religion that i know almost nothing about really enjoyed it","556":"i found this book engrossing thought provoking beautifully written and confusing as hell in a good way i blogged more about it","557":"i am forbidden a great read starts a little slow for me but ends with a bang looking forward to meeting her at the jewish book council","558":"i read this book in one day but it was a book with a very sad story to tell it talked about the bounds of some religions and the laws that they lay down laws that can cause stories like this one this happens to be about a strict jewish sect but it could be about many other religions sects forms of beliefs this book caused me to question all organized man made organized led etc religions but for others well they may find it read differently to them and to be fair it isn't just this book that calls religions into question for me but the story does do that while at the same time there is some form of beauty there in faith that lays out answers to life and it's messiness and all the questions it is well written and often lyrical but at it's essence it was too sad a story for me and i really didn't like the book","559":"i found this to be an amazing book multi dimensional and multi layered it explores what happens when the letter of the law conflicts with the spirit of the law and the powerful even devastating effects that conflict inflicts on those involved","560":"amazing read","561":"one of those books i know i should appreciate more but i just couldn't get into the story not at all what i expected","562":"starts slow but gets good","563":"i really tried to get into this one but i kept having to go backand listen over parts not terrible just not easy to listen to while um driving","564":" a rare and intimate look at the hasidic jewish culture emotionally moving it leads you through the wwii years briefly to present day following the life mainly of an orphaned jewish girl mila who is raised by another jewish family she continues to embrace her orthodox customs while the biological daughter of the couple rebels against the lifestyle mila marries an orphaned jewish boy and have some hardship in their marriage mila finds in the sacred readings what she considers a way to achieve her life's goals but ultimately it leads to tragedy for future generations","565":"beautifully written although fiction it has a strong tie to factual history very eye opening","566":" before reading this book i knew nothing about hasidic judaism much less the satmar sect admittedly there were several times at the beginning of the story where i was a bit confused and was forced to re listen to whole passages due to this lack of context but as i grew more acclimated to the story and the language i was enthralled and quickly finished this sweeping and sometimes very sad novel this story is populated with a rich cast of characters but the two sisters mila and atara are the heart of the story despite being very close as young girls they grow apart as their differing views of faith begin to affect their life choices after things come to head and atara leaves the family the story revolves almost solely around mila mila is a complex and very admirable character but there is a large hole throughout much of the rest of the narrative where atara should be both of these women their experiences and emotions felt very real to me which is probably due in large part to the fact that markovits herself grew up in a satmar family and left when she was 19 in centering the story around mila and not atara whose life choices mirror the author's it seems like markovits could be exploring the path she choose not to take despite some pacing problems and my constant wondering about atara's life i really enjoyed this novel i was fascinated by the descriptions of the culture and the traditions of the satmar sect and also by the true life story of the satmar rebbe who escaped the holocaust while his followers remained behind which had drastic consequences for the fictional mila and her family additionally i think markovits does a beautiful job exploring the boundaries between faith personal freedom and family responsibility through mila and atara this is a great read and i definitely recommend it 4 5 stars","567":"this book was a real disappointment to me i found the beginning poorly written as it was hard to follow and seemed to try too hard the writing style improved in the middle as it became simpler and more descriptive the style became 'scatty' at the end i did not find the characters well developed fully rounded or interesting the book also did not describe enough about hisidic judaism for me and seemed to require a more detailed knowledge of judaism than i had","568":" it was an exciting event to open the mailbox and find an advance readers copy of a book i have wanted to read for a while thereadingroom and the crown publishing group were gracious to send me a copy of \"i am forbidden\" by anouk markovits this book shows the reader a glimpse of hasidic jewish life i have never read anything about jewish fundamentalism and was fascinated the life is very restrictive and uncompromising what is portrayed in the characters doesn't leave this reader thinking badly of this faith - as there is love and beauty intermingled with the oft times harshness of the law the beginning of the story takes place at the start of world war ii in romania and is terribly sad as was to be expected from the time and place we meet a young jewish boy named josef who is rescued from death by a gentile woman who takes him as her own son into josef's life drops mila a jewish girl who loses her parents to the nazis mila ends up with the family of zalman stern due to josef's intervention and is raised as his daughter and atara's sister zalman returns for josef after the war to make certain he grows in his own faith and doesn't continue to live as a gentile josef is sent to america to study under their revered rebbe in the mean time zalman stern raises mila along with his daughter atara and other siblings as hasidic jews in a very restrictive lifestyle in paris mila is a true believer and one day becomes the wife of josef she is wonderfully happy and loves her life with him and their community of faith in williamsburg the flaw that seeks to destroy their married happiness is lack of children - year after year mila's decisions in regards to having children lead to devastation and heartbreak atara finds that she is not a true believer her path is completely different from mila's and away from her family she never stops loving them - she is just not able to live their restrictive life bound by faith and law this story is complex and far reaching in time period and characters it was difficult to put this book down even when i was so sad for the characters that i thought i would have to stop reading the author created characters that the reader will not want to let go of and that is a true author's gift","569":"this was actually a very well written book it just wasn't my thing","570":"i really wanted to love this book but it's not well written the story itself is also extremely disjointed and underdeveloped","571":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2012 05","572":"a truly disturbing novel but i found myself unable to put it down","573":"i don't know how anyone could read and understand and enjoy this book if they do not have knowledge of judaism and jewish law i can imagine a lot of readers getting frustrated at not understanding the language or references to jewish texts even more than that i can imagine people getting incredibly frustrated with the limitations and rules and wondering why can't so and so just do x or why does it have to be like y if they don't want it to be like that but if you do understand the rules i think you would have a very deep understanding and therefore appreciation for the torment and inner struggles these characters face i would highly recommend the book to anyone with knowledge of jewish law i would also recommend it to people who have read unorthodox and would be interested in hearing how the two fit together no spoilers but the striking cover art becomes haunting once you finish the book incredibly done","574":"wow four generations in 302 pages the best book of 2012 for me","575":"i couldn't muster much enthusiasm for this book the prose is actually quite confusing sometimes i felt as if the author assumed the reader was ultra orthodox other times i wondered if she wrote it in french and the translation was lacking","576":"a delicate heart breaking jewel of a book i couldn't put it down and within a few pages i was deeply in love with atara mila and josef so beautiful","577":"i would not recommend it","578":"i am forbidden was a fascinating look into an insular sect of hasidic jews the satmar when the book begins during world war ii a young jewish boy witnesses the murder of his family josef is taken in by the family's christian maid and raised as her son a few years later he again witnesses the murder of a family this time the hellers parents of mila mila survives and josef helps her escape to the home of yalman stern her father's study partner and a leader in their hasidic community the stern family adopts mila and raises her as their own and she becomes particularly close to their eldest daughter atara who is only a year younger as mila and atara mature mila becomes more devout than ever while atara starts to question the faith much later in life mila now married is hiding a secret that could destroy her family could atara estranged from the family and the community help her sister i definitely enjoyed this book which is the author's english language debut one of my weaknesses as far as reading is concerned is for peeks into secretive religious communities i read the 19th wife for the same reason i really know nothing about the hasidic jewish faith so that aspect of the book was incredibly interesting the character development and the plot however left me a little bit wanting i really liked the first half of the book which focused on atara and mila equally and showed their divergent paths as atara begins to question everything and mila feels compelled to distance herself from her embarrassing sister much as it pains her to do so but the second half of the book was basically the mila show and while i loved and sympathized with mila i wanted more atara i wanted to see where her path in life takes her but she essentially disappears from the story midway through and only reappears at the very end with her entire adult life having happened off the page that disappointed me since she was my favorite character i suppose i was expecting atara to be the main character since the author herself escaped from a satmar community and i think atara was supposed to be the author's stand in on the page it's okay that this book wasn't actually atara's story but i didn't realize that going in and i was disappointed when atara eventually became little more than an off page presence if that still the writing was evocative and atmospheric mila's story was compelling and it kept me turning pages three very solid stars and i'll be following this author to see what she does next","579":"strange but interesting knew lots of stuff about judaism hasidim in general but some of the hasidic laws were new to me and in some ways a real eye opener","580":"an intense look at the inner world of a fictional hasidic jew family spanning world war ii in europe to the modern day in eastern america it's sad and troubling and i found myself a little disturbed to discover it was written by a woman who has left an hasidic family and lifestyle it is intimate enough with sacred pieces of religious belief that it felt a little like a betrayal a tragic and haunting work","581":"at first it was difficult to follow the story with my limited knowledge of the hasidic community in the end it was a very interesting story and beautifully written","582":"i loved this book it was written beautifully and i thought the author illustrated the pain a woman would bear from not being able to fulfill what she sees as her lifes purpose in this case it is to be able to bear a child and the desperation that ensues when orthodox religion fuels her identity a sure favorite","583":"four stars i really enjoyed it and would recommend it i borrowed this from the library because of some good reviews i read i'm glad i did the writing style is unique and engaging the peek into ultra orthodox jewish life is fascinating the author did a great job of making both those who are devoted to the community and those who leave sympathetic and well rounded i'll be looking for more work by this author","584":" this book is one of the most wonderfully sad pathetic using the term to mean moving touching poignant heartbreaking heart rending it is also at one point a much more deep version of an american short story but to say which one would be a spoiler contact me privately should you wish all three abrahamic religion believe in a god who is both just and also merciful we who believe consider we should god act as god would have us act a dilemma arises when we confront transgression which is more important justice or mercy and how do we decide without offending one or the other should we punish or forgive and in what measure can we do good for the wrong reasons and or bad for the right reasons in a christian context the book is about hasidim when do we throw out the money changers and when do we declare the sabbath was made for man this is exactly with which the main characters wrestle and different ideas are taken by different people who is right i would recommend this book to anyone as long as they do not expect since it is about religion it to be all happy clappy","585":"i read a great review and was really interested in the story i didn't even know there was a more conservative sect of judaism beyond the hasadim i was really looking forward to learning amidst a good story i was so disappointed not enough history weak story little context just plain disappointing","586":"i was hoping to learn more about judaism through this book and instead i often felt confused by the words and terminology that i did not understand sometimes the author offered a translation in parentheses but not consistently the story started slow and picked up when the forbidden act occurs a little more than halfway through it is amazing to think that there are people who live according to these laws even today","587":"this was the book clubs selection for november i thught the book was very good i couldnt get over the ay the jews felt about the other jews of course the characters were very narrow minded the people were very cruel to their children if they didn't behve merged review very good this was our november selection for our book club hard tobelieve how one sect of jews acted toward another also how narrow minded they were i really liked it","588":"although the first 30 40 pages had me completely lost due to a language barrier i enjoyed this book to its fullest a definite must read for those interested in fundamentalist religions as well as the holocaust","589":"interesting writing style really learned a lot of hasidic judaism fascinating","590":"this was a great read really shows that every religion can have its unbelievable extremes the two sisters in the book are raised in a hassidic sect just after the holocaust one marries within the sect and the other leaves to seek her own life i was a bit disappointed that we don't learn much about the sister who leaves but the story of the one that remains is fascinating in a frustrating and tragic way i don't want to give away too much but would definitely recommend this read","591":"i couldn't get into this book it has received great reviews and i was really looking forward to reading it but it just never grabbed me i may try it again in a few months maybe i needed a different type of book right now as the premise is intriguing","592":"just genius and the author is writing in her second or third language wow very plain prose which ripped me in half beautiful love the cover image also","593":"an addition to my jewish guilt novels like the chosen howeverin the convoluted ending and the complete disappearance of a main character until the ending which comes off more like a deus ex machina event rather than something meaningful it starts to lose its way right about the time the main characters split and there's not enough depth in the characters themselves i can't even blame the translation it doesn't ever really bring all the threads back into play","594":"review pending i got to mull over it a bit","595":"it was a quick read and i'm glad i read it but it wasn't entirely captivating for me","596":"this the story follows three children being raised by strict hasidic law i found it very difficult to follow in the beginning as the story focused on the rebbe and his actions i considered outing the story down but became engaged when the narrative shifted to the children and their paths to say i enjoyed this book is to say that it is engaging and well written the story however made me angry and brought about questions of tolerance","597":"heartbreaking","598":"this is a very interesting look into the satmar fundamentalist sect she shows how for one person this life is like a prison while for another the rules and structure are comforting i liked the first part much better than the last third i felt that it rushed through the end","599":"i could not put this book down i was fascinated and horrified at the same time i enjoyed reading about orthodox judaism the rules and practices in this book are extreme but are probably not unique to orthodoxy i am sure similar practices are common in other extremely observant religious groups i know that many people find comfort in that type of rigidity personally i have found that when i get too hung up on all the rules i lose sight of the deeper spiritual connection that i enjoy","600":"this was a really interesting book definitely much more interesting to read it if you are jewish and or very familiar with lots of jewish terminology","601":" the story of mila and her sister atara from the family that adopted her after her parents die in wwii the story moves from transylvania to paris to williamsburg ny a devotedly jewish family surviving after the war thus book is a quick read and in many wats i found it very disturbing what i didn't like was how rushed it was at the end and how atara is more or less forgotten until the very end i would not describe this book as enjoyable because to me it was very dark and i found the subjugation of women to be somewhat disturbing","602":"this saga begins as the jews of transylvania are deported killed and disperse to other countries at the outset of world war ii and follows the lives of two young jewish children who survive the murders of their families and grow up in the very conservative satmar traditions in paris and the united states they eventually meet again as young adults and marry suffer through agonizing years of childlessness until a daughter is born and then watch their daughter and granddaughter grow and mature within the same conservative jewish culture until they all have to face a troubling secret from the past the author grew up in a satmar home until she rebelled much like one of the characters in this fascinating novel so she knows whereof she writes but she writes from a point of appreciating the culture rather than criticizing it plus the writing is excellent it's more a jewish story than a holocaust story and fans of the red tent and nathan englander's stories will enjoy it","603":"i thought it was well written but the beginning confused me plot wise and i found the ensuing story a little meandering and lacking in dramatic tension but i seem to be in a very small minority","604":"absolutely fascinating and not what i was expecting at all having read unorthodox exodus and the marrying of chani kaufman fairly recently i was expecting more of the same an almost lurid look into the closed communities of the ultra orthodox note i absolutely loved all three of those books they were fascinating and well written and in no way salacious anyway this one reads much more like a true novel than those others one which just happens to be set within that community definitely recommend if you liked the others i mentioned this is a must for you","605":" i'm not quite sure what to make of this book and why exactly the author wrote it i found it enormously sad and sometimes obscure and hard to read sad because so much seems lost in the name of religion yes i realize that i have my own prejudices and feelings about religion and i cannot judge how others feel about it but it seems to me that so much of life is wasted trying to conform to a certain set of rules not to mention the community which is not strictly speaking part of the religion but it certainly influences the choices characters make markovits is from a hasidic tradition which she left apparently i wonder why she chose to write this book and why she made hasidic life look the way it does yes the book was obscure and hard to read quite a lot was written in a sort of poetic way with short non sentences one word descriptions to give the read a picture of the action okay but i found myself in several places going back and rereading a few paragraphs because i just wasn't sure what was going on i prefer books in which the plot is clear it wasn't here so overall not a very satisfying experience although i learned quite a bit about hasidic life more than i knew before","606":"i liked this book a lot it was kind of hard to follow at first because i have zero knowledge of jewish customs but an excellent story overall i highly recommend it","607":" a beautifully told and horrifying account of two children from transylvania whose parents are killed by the iron guard and who are saved after the war by their satmar hasidic community i read that this sect are mostly hungarian and romanian jews who relocated to williamsburg ny after the war and continued to live study and work together rarely coming into contact with outsiders who might corrupt their congregation the author herself was raised in france in a satmar home before leaving at 19 to avoid an arranged marriage leaving means knowing that your father will disown you and you may never see your family again part of the story takes place in france where two sisters one rescued and adopted are raised in a fundamentalist home where the weight of their every action is a judgement for or against the salvation of their murdered families this is not a light read the search for buried family in the deserted cemeteries with its uncared for and overturned tombstones was especially poignant as my husband also visited many grown over cemeteries with tossled about tombstones when i lived in transylvania there were no jews left to care for them and in my town the synogogue was a wood factory it is a catastrophe as our french speaking hungarian friend and guide told my husband in sibiu the mayor's wife told me she had seen the last jew of sibiu riding a bicycle in town with that in mind i found the transylvania sections so real and beautifully rendered and the story so compelling i wondered if it might be true i loved the novel until book iv and v in fact and this is not a long book just a divided one the last part of the book switches characters and it feels rushed and the poetic nature of the telling becomes more labored so the book was spoiled for me by the new character and the suddeness of the conclusion markovits writes a denouement in four pages and the loving adopted mother whom i haven't even mentioned but is a significant character gets a half a page she deserves more and as a reader i felt i did too","608":"not what i was expecting from the inside cover and review i was anticipating a totally different story it started strong but the in the span of a few pages we jumped years and then another page or two and we had jumped another 10years i wish more time would have been spent from both sisters perspective","609":"the author's style is fairly lean so it took a little bit for me to get into the prose since i'm not familiar with yiddish or hasidic terms the plot unfolded the way i expected then followed a character i didn't expect and took some interesting turns this isn't the author's fault but i wish i'd known there was a glossary in the back of the book before i read the whole thing i could have used it","610":"this is one of the best books i have ever read","611":" this is an incredible look into the culture of hasidic jews going all the way back to 1930's in central europe to modern day williamsburg the long view helps the reader see what shapes each character and why they make the decisions they do the story is centered in the lives of two sisters one taken in after her family is killed shaped by the same history they take very different paths one remaining in the repressive culture of the hasidic jews the other becoming a scholar there are moments of pain and points of decision that are so raw and beautiful at the same time markovits is a poet and the way her characters are drawn allows the reader to feel the utmost empathy for them all regardless of hoe you feel about the paths they have chosen","612":"this is a holocaust story from the viewpoint of the satmar sect of hasidim the author explores the long reaching effects of loss as two orphans try their best to follow the laws of their religion it is a sad story presenting many questions about the origin and maintenance of faith the power and control of the rabbis and the importance of lineage and family","613":" this is the story of a particular family of hasidic jews of eastern europe before during and after ww2 the author knows what she is writing about as she was brought up in an ultra orthodox satmar home this particular belief system that the hasidic jews practice is insular and the followers do not want to share their beliefs with the outside world but consider themselves better than the others the three main characters mila atara and josef show a wide varity of emotions of how they can fit themselves into this sect or not love the author's writingthis particular belief system his particular sect of a fundamental religious community demonstrates again to me what people will do to each other in the name of religion","614":" i'm not sure what to make of this book the basic plot is great and the story is fine but the language and telling of said plot they just don't work for me for one a lot of the words don't make sense because they're yiddish and are just causally thrown in without translation and if they are translated they just don't fit second the plot has issues and there's this build up to malia finding out the truth of what happens to her and then nothing it just falls away and there's no resolution third the ending was really really rushed so i'm not quite sure what to make of it or how i feel about this book it wasn't at all what i was expecting a plot having to deal with the holocaust world war ii romania and hungary during the war those things are only brief they happen in the beginning of the book and then just kind of left there as an afterthought and only mentioned as ideas later in the book","615":"my heart ached with overwhelming sadness as i placed this book down this is a stunning story of human fickleness strength religious faith unwaivering loyalty love for family disappointment and betrayal the story took its time to slowly develop each character it was a real eye opener into the secular world of judaism","616":" i am forbidden was an extremely tough book to read perhaps it was because the tone of book conveyed a lot of darkness or it might be that it was my own lack of knowledge that had me bogged down that being said i couldn't put the darn book down i do believe the author set out to bring the life of a particular section of judaism that most of us like myself are not familiar with markovits certainly has made me think about how important it is to continue discovering more about it the book shifts from romania france and america in different points of the 20th century and follows several women their friendships loves and secrets oh and yeah that ending was something","617":"i like to read books about the holocaust so i picked this one up not your typical book this is very orthodox i had hard time reading this and never did finish i gave it 2 stars just to be a little fairer","618":"the author writes about a community she knows from the inside and as an exile i am forbidden is a heartbreaking novel that traces the lives of an extended and broken family that was ripped apart and reassembled by the holocaust it describes the endless rituals and restrictions that are part of everyday life in an ultra strict satmar hassidic jewish community along with the guilt brutality and destructiveness that can result when a member of the community male but especially a female one violates its numerous laws and traditions without leaving the community itself and even when one does this is a novel about deep commitment and it is a book about how love can be twisted and stifled by fundamentalism it provided a window into the closed doors of a satmar community i was fascinated appalled and deeply touched by what i learned","619":"sometimes a belief system makes a person desperate he she can't see past the limitations of said belief system this book is fascinating for anyone who has experienced these limitations and worked hard for a way out","620":"awesome read","621":"i am thankful for this small glimpse into a world i have only seen u0026amp heard about from a distance i'm going to need time to digest all i have taken in from this book","622":"if you like chaim potok's books this may interest you","623":"wow fascinating and very moving really enjoyed this one","624":" the book was riveting and did increase my knowledge of historical events in relation to the jews around the 1940s without any spoilers the differences between different sects in judaism was included but i would have preferred a more detailed explanation from the author character building was seen but they were gaps in the story that i found disappointing one of which was the lack of atara's story after the biggest transition of her life the relationship between certain characters were never fully developed and makes me wonder if that was intentional to show the religious impact on relationships the ending was really lumpy and made me wonder if there couldn't have been a different alternative overall it was a story that was very interesting except for the few cons that i mentioned it did make me curious to explore history research and push me to find answers impelled by the holes in the story","625":"i enjoyed the human roller coaster of emotions and generations of the characters","626":"i read a lot of jewish literature so i was very excited to receive this book through read it forward after reading the first few pages i almost put it down the writing was very choppy with very little explanation of what was happening and why i decided to keep reading and i'm glad i did once i got through the beginning i couldn't put this book down the subject was fascinating and the writing was beautiful i definitely recommend this book","627":"if you had read unorthodoxed you would also enjoy this book this book is a novel but it brings you from europe to thr satmars in williamsburg enjoyed it very much","628":"not a perfect book but an absorbing read a closed strict society and how hard it is to break free","629":"interesting read never knew about the kazstner train","630":"i won a copy of this book through read it forward and i am very glad i did it was one i never would have picked up off the shelf otherwise it was hard to get into in the beginning and i am sure that has a lot to do with all the terms being used that were all new to me plus i definitely didnt realize there was a glossary in the back once i started to understand more of what was going on it become very interesting to me and i didnt want to put it down","631":"excellent insights into the hasidic jewish lifestyle but the story built for several hundred pages only to drop off at the end is it just me or are the story lines in novels getting weaker and weaker","632":"when i started this book i wasn't sure that i would like this too much boy was i surprised it is very well written and really enlightens you to the jewish world","633":"i liked it but i didn't it was about a family of hasidic jews and it all seemed so extreme that i didn't know whether to believe it the author was a hasidic jew who left to avoid an arranged marriage so perhaps you have to take it with a grain of salt another heartbreaking look at what ww2 did","634":" this was a very interesting book in that it taught me a lot about hasidic jewish life i thought i had a good understanding of the rules of that community but i really had no idea there were numerous times in the book where i was shocked at the level of control and lack of choices for the women in the story i liked that the author included people who didn't want to conform to those expectations to show a contrast of the ways of life i was frustrated a number of times by the acceptance of some of the women to their position in the community i know this comes through because of my cultural lens as a modern jewish woman but i found it hard to leave that at the door the two major twists in the text were really great i was thinking that they were going to happen but it seemed like a cry from my modern subconscious and not a real option until it actually did happen i would recommend getting this on audio like i did because of the many languages used throughout the book","635":"my first book on this topic was unorthodoxed and that was an excellent read then i read i am forbidden in 2 days it is hard to grasp the stout traditions and beliefs of the satmar community but the story is compelling with a surprise and poignant finale","636":"this is the first english speaking book for anouk markovits she is an amazingly gifted writer and allows youinto the lives of the hassidic jews from pass generations to the present this is a story of two children who witness the brutal murders of their parents and siblings in transylvania in 1939 and 1944 you travel with them toparis and williamsburg brooklyn the author herself left her trade trial home to follow her dreams","637":" there once was a young frenchwoman leaving her ultra orthodox community and family fleeing an arranged marriage she came to america and earned a bs from columbia a masters of architecture from harvard and a phd in romance studies art u0026amp literature from cornell married and created a beautiful life her first english novel i am forbidden is an artfully crafted story of hasidim children surviving the terror of wwii in transylvania and creating generations of survivors i enjoyed the peek into orthodox communities of paris u0026amp williamsburg brooklyn from post war time through the 21st century","638":" the style of this book is unique in that it covers a large amount of time in a small amount of pages the details in the first few chapters are conveyed in memories of sights sounds and impressions it was a bit difficult to get into at first i had to read a couple of the beginning scenes over again to make sure i truly understood what was happening the style grew on me i enjoyed the speed with which it moved things along and the connection it gave me to the feelings of the characters the characters in this book and the harshness of their world will stick with me for awhile it has made me consider once again the great importance of grace mercy and forgiveness","639":"interesting book about insulated hasidic sect great book club discussion book","640":" josef lichtenstein sees his family murdered by the romanian iron guard he is taken by florina the family servant to live with her as her son anghel anghel later saves a young girl mila when her parents are killed as they try to get their rebbe to save them anghel helps mila find zalman stern a leader in the satmar community she is brought as his

hold onto their beliefs and live a righteous life so sad we know how josef feels but we don't get the same amount of insight into mila's feelings thoughtful book","641":"i won this book from goodreads this novel by anouk markovits promises to become a bestseller i am forbidden is the most gripping story that i have read for a long time the purpose of good literature is to entertain and to inform i am forbidden did both","642":"haunting and heartbreaking novel of two girls growing up in a hasidic household one a member of the family and one an orphan taken in and how their beliefs and paths differ throughout their lives i love that each one does her own necessary desperate act in her own time beautiful","643":"markovits covers a lot of ground in her tale of two almost sisters growing up and then apart in a satmar household in paris the picture she paints of the community is not flattering as i'm sure was her intent having left as her bio states at 19 to pursue a secular education the questions she raises are thought provoking and stay with you long after the plot of the novel dissolves what is forbidden what is forsaken when should one fight is staying silent ever an option","644":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is one of the rare books that i have given three stars because it could have been five stars and just wasn't i think this is a tough book to like as such can you really like a book that's this disturbing and intense did i really like sophie's choice but i wanted it to be better my main quibble with i am forbidden is that it was too short what i wanted was for markovits to alternate chapters giving us mila and josef's admittedly gripping story juxtaposed with atara's struggle this is one of the rare books that i have given three stars because it could have been five stars and just wasn't i think this is a tough book to like as such can you really like a book that's this disturbing and intense did i really like sophie's choice but i wanted it to be better my main quibble with i am forbidden is that it was too short what i wanted was for markovits to alternate chapters giving us mila and josef's admittedly gripping story juxtaposed with atara's struggle to find her place outside of the satmar sect i was surprised when atara who had previously been a non entity became interesting and important after her father beat her and she began reading secular books and then i was equally surprised when markovits didn't revisit her until forty years after she left satmar i think mila's struggle with infertility and all of the scriptural references that she turned to for comfort leading eventually to her one indiscretion and its consequences would have been even more fascinating if we had also experienced atara's trajectory and struggles how did she become a filmmaker what did she do when she first left her family and then at the end the reconnection between the two women who had been practically sisters growing up could have been so powerful because we would have watched them leading parallel lives for however many pages so close ms markovits but not quite more","645":" i am forbidden shines a light on what it means to be a woman in the satmar sect when mila and josef marry what it means for someone to say \"i am forbidden so are my children and my children's children forbidden for ten generations male or female \" there is such a heaviness to the novel but it was so fascinating that i didn't want to put it down markovits enables readers to sympathize with the characters even when they might not agree with their religious convictions i really felt for both mila and atara throughout the book and i teared up many times while reading the book was perfectly paced yet at times i felt the pages turned too quickly because i knew i wouldn't be ready to let these characters go full review on diary of an eccentric","646":" a family is torn apart by fierce belief and private longing in the unprecedented journey deep inside the most insular sect of hasidic jews the satmar in 1939 5 year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by romanian iron guard he is taken in by a gentile maid who raises him as her own son five years later josef rescues a young girl mila whose parents are killed in the wake of nazi deportation josef helps mila find safety with zalman stern a leader in the satmar community in whose home mila is raised as a sister to zalman's daughter atara the two girls form a fierce bond but as they mature atara feels trapped by the restraints of jewish fundamentalism while mila embraces her faith and her role as a respected young woman in her community when josef returns and chooses mila to be his bride she eagerly strives to be an ideal wife but a desperate choice after ten years of childless marriage threatens to separate her from everything and everyone she cherishes one of the most fascinating books i read in 2015","647":"fascinating and poetic","648":"i really really liked the story and the subject greatly interests me but i found the writing to be too scattered","649":" this is a book written by a woman who grew up in a satmar hasidic community and left this life behind when faced with the prospect of an arranged marriage this book took me awhile to read because there was so much to consider within markovits's personal experience clearly colors the entire story but she sheds light on the positive feelings that arise being a member of such a tight knit community in addition to the restrictions and the unfairness of how generations of the future are punished due to the minor infractions of generations of the past before the book gets to the main story of mila and atara two young ladies who develop very different attitudes to their religious upbringing it takes you back to world war ii transylvania so you can see how the family was formed as well as the extreme difficulties faced by this generation i thought this would mainly be atara's story since she is clearly the author's avatar but i appreciated how the focus shifted to mila and the difficulties she faced when she struggled to achieve the one thing that was expected of her within the community and her family the relationship between her and josef was so sad to me since they would have had so much love if not for the extremely strict rules they had to abide by overall this was an interesting but heartbreaking look at life within a strict religious sect anouk markovits displayed all aspects here and did it with excellent prose and lots of emotion behind all her words","650":"i am forbidden follows four generations of members of an insular hasidic sect the book opens in 1939 transylvania as a five year old josef witnesses the murder of his family by a pitchfork wielding member of the romanian iron guard josef is rescued by the family's gentile maid who raises the boy as her own five years later josef helps a young girl mila unite with zalman stern a leader in the satmar community after her own family is murdered while trying to board a train carrying their rebbe to safety mila is raised in paris with the sterns children and becomes a sister to astara yet as the girls become teens their paths diverge mila becomes more devout embracing the satmar community with the knowledge that her faith will lead her back to her deceased parents while atara begins to wonder about life on the outside smuggling secular books into the home and questioning authority at 16 astara packs a toothbrush and some underwear and steps out of her family home not to be heard from for 47 years mila is wedded to josef and moves to the satmar community in williamsburg brooklyn where her happiness is clouded by her inability to conceive despite their love for each other after 10 years an orthodox jewish man could no longer abstain from the commandment to be fruitful and multiply mila and josef's shared devotion to their faith threatens to destroy them despite an involved plot markovitz's prose speeds through decades continents and hasidic rituals she remains largely nonjudgmental except for the limited possibilities allowed women about the satmar rituals while showing how even the most fervent believers struggle with faith the only shortcoming of the book is markovitz's failure to follow astara's path from homeless teen in paris to successful filmmaker in new york perhaps that story will be her sophmore effort","651":"i loved this book but it was also very troubling the inflexibility of an ultra religious community and the inability of a man to face a loss leads to a terribly sad ending i highly recommend this book but be prepared to cry","652":" i am forbidden is a fascinating account of life inside the world of hasidic judaism the extremely rigid rules and highly pious culture sound impossible to us outsiders but being born into this lifestyle is another story i found it very effective to start the story back in the early 1940's and cover all the years up to the present as we get a couple of generations to experience we focus mainly on atara and mila who grow up together after atara's family takes in mila after she is orphaned her parents are murdered during wwii and raise her as their own as the girls age mila embraces the rules and the orthodox life while atara rebels asks too many questions and does not want a future of an arranged marriage and a clan of children what happens to both girls women will keep you wanting to know more until the very last page not knowing any hasidic jews personally i have no idea what their opinion is of this book i would be very interested to hear what they have to say is this an accurate account or exaggerated or offensive i would like to know i could have used a more extensive glossary a short glossary was given for the layreader but i still came across many words not included in the glossary that i had to guess at their meanings","653":"really a 3 5 well written but so depressing i would have enjoyed more character building","654":"less a review more of a comment i love this book i can't stop thinking about the ending and how things tied together in such a tragic way","655":"i left reading this one feeling very unsettled i felt disappointed disjointed and unhappy it left me in a funk i guess i can say not my favourite book","656":"very interesting book left me wanting to know more about satmar and atara","657":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this was a real disappointment to me i was hoping for not just a glimpse into the unique traditions of this hasidic jewish sect but also an understanding of why they believe and live as they do instead i got an unrelentingly depressing story of the trauma their faith inflicts on generations of family members from the children who miraculously escape the holocaust in which their families are slaughtered all the way down to their grandchildren despite its thoughtful language and intriguing ch this was a real disappointment to me i was hoping for not just a glimpse into the unique traditions of this hasidic jewish sect but also an understanding of why they believe and live as they do instead i got an unrelentingly depressing story of the trauma their faith inflicts on generations of family members from the children who miraculously escape the holocaust in which their families are slaughtered all the way down to their grandchildren despite its thoughtful language and intriguing characters i couldn't build an emotional connection to their miserable lives and never comprehended what inspired the beliefs they held so strongly that they destroyed their own happiness and ultimately their lives to maintain obedience to their community's demands the author herself left that community at 19 to avoid an arranged marriage according to the biographical blurb so perhaps she wasn't sympathetic enough with the beliefs of the people she left behind to portray them in a more positive light still that made the whole novel seem like an indictment not an exploration more","658":"i was really looking forward to this book and had really hoped for more","659":" this is a disturbing book once i started listening to the audiobook excellently narrated by rosalyn landor i could do nothing else but listen to more and more and more still until i reached the end if i am to set the star rating by how urgent it was to read the book once i started it would get five stars but i am not giving it five stars only four i had to listen because i was so disturbed i had to listen because in the beginning it was confusing i even had to listen to the first hour and half twice to know if you want to read this book you must have a general idea of its themes it deals with hasidism particularly the satmar sect of jews living in transylvania it deals with women who want children very very much and cannot get pregnant how and why can infertility destroy a relationship it deals with to what degree do you follow rules e x a c t l y and who has the right to bend the rules and who cannot hasidism should it be criticized for being strict and inflexible or is it the people who slavishly implement the rules that are to be criticized judaism is known for being a religion open to discussion and debate but what about in the satmar sect the story begins in the 1930s near the hungarian romanian border clearly another theme is the jewish situation in this area during ww2 and specifically the guilt versus innocence of rezso kasztner http en wikipedia org wiki rezso_ka and how the satmar jews viewed zionism kasztner was a zionist related to kasztner is the theme whom do you choose to save is it the number that counts the question expands as the novel continues do you do it at any cost and when do you save yourself none of these are easy questions do you understand why i could not stop listening btw i found kasztner's train the true story of an unknown hero of the holocaust confusing so i cannot recommend it one complaint that i had initially was that only the harshness and destructive qualities of the hasidic beliefs seemed to be depicted as i continued through the book the author also showed wonderful traditions of the satmar jews there are songs and rituals filled with happiness and delight the view became balanced the sentences if sometimes ambiguous and even confusing at points were also very often beautiful jewish expressions and french lines are thrown in the french is usually translated but less often the jewish expressions i mentioned above the theme related to how rules can restrict and thus make you crazy for freedom atara opened the door to the parisian street in the shivery parisian dawn a swell of poppies swayed each blossom a scarlet freedom quivering on its fragile stem end of book two isn't that pretty there are many such lines i have not told you why the book is disturbing it is sad to watch what people do to each other it is hard to watch what life throws in our path did i want a happier ending no this ends on a good note that is realistic too this is not a fairy tale novel to really understand you have to read the book see how the plot unfolds and concludes please see the book description i did not want to repeat what is mentioned there","660":"i thought the book was interesting and sad i don't know much about the jewish religion and how strict it can be so strict that lives are changed by it i am forbidden takes you into the lives of a family who follows the faith with no exceptions when you follow something so rigidly somethings have to break","661":"good story that kept me interested allusive writing style though that sometimes had me reading the same paragraph three times in order to understand","662":"a book with some very promising concepts that ultimately fall apart towards the second half","663":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i've been reading a lot of books about hasidic jews who decide to leave the community but the more compelling aspect of this novel is the development of mina a orphan who finally takes her destiny in her own hands i also love how the public library is the villian in many of these stories because it opens up the outside world to people who have been told to rely on rabbis for information the author once a member of the satmar sect uses her insight to weave a very compelling read that

more","664":"very interesting but upsetting book it is hard to believe i am the same religion as these people they are so intolerant","665":"satmar hassidism wwii transylvania judah tamar sadness judith dies in the end","666":"an interesting glimpse into a closed society","667":"this book focused on a hacidic jewish family marriage and the stringent laws within the religion atara mila and josef struggle with trying to meet the requirements of their religion the story is heartbreaking even agonizing at times as they try so hard to do the right thing and work so stringently at meeting the requirements of their religion i could barely put this book down once i started it","668":"really wonderful story about post war jews trying to make sense of their lives faith and the world","669":" so glad that i decided to listen to this it's not an easy book at points its just utterly depressing but the look into the insular life of orthodox judaism is fascinating and i found myself sympathizing with all the characters and understanding the choices that they made mila's longing for a child and josef's inner torment and desperate love for his wife made me cry at several points the story is thick with hebrew and yiddish phrases that take some getting used to but if you can stick with it the story is beautiful and haunting and so relatable in unexpected ways it's a book that is well worth seeing through to the end and the narration is excellent on the audio","670":"i agree with other readers this book was slow going at first i would read maybe 20 pages one week 30 the next and then nothing for a few weeks but for whatever reason some time last week i picked it up and got sucked in reading well over half of the book in one sitting when it was over i was in shock but i also understood where each of the characters were coming from and why they did what they did there were no villains in i am forbidden just flawed humans looking for the best way for them to come to terms with their relationship with g d and their relationship with the world around them i feel i will have to re read the book or at least the last third of it someday to truly appriciate all the finer nuances but it's safe to say i will be passing this book around to my friends i would also love to see a companion book to show us what was happening atara after she left her home and how she made her way through the world successfully i know the author said that she thought it was more interesting writing a story from the prospective of someone who stayed but atara's journey is still one i would like to read about","671":"interesting subject well written in a soft way","672":" i received this book in a giveaway from goodreads this is a book about a very strict group within the jewish faith the story begin in world war ii where we see three jewish children affected by the war the author takes us on a journey of the lives of these children as they grow up in the post war period and all the way into their senior years the author allows the reader to experience the emotions of these three characters as they struggle to make life altering decisions stay in the hasidic faith marriage proposals secrets lies and live with their choices i was surprised to learn so much about the restrictions of this faith and how these affected the characters in profound ways overall i would give this 3 5 stars an interesting story with characters whom you care about deeply at times it was a struggle to decipher the foreign language words used in the text but there is a glossary at the end of the book and most words can be understood in context of the reading","673":" this novel is truly a seminal work on the topic of jewish fundamentalism with unparalleled detail and poignant storytelling this saga of a satmar family explores and debunks the myths upon which the extreme version of judaism we know today was founded and it does so with a resounding clang i found myself gripping the edge of my seat quite a few times holding my breath while i waited to see how the characters in this novel would find self determination people will read this novel both because it is a beautiful story told in a magical setting and because it completely unravels a world heretofore tightly enclosed i extend my deepest gratitude and admiration for anouk markovits who so skillfully brought my world to life and abolished the mysteries that remained of my childhood","674":"very interesting well written story about 3 generations of hasidic jews one very orthodox wife can't conceive because her husband is sterile knowing he could put her away because they haven't conceived and also knowing how deeply they love each other she comes up with a solution but her granddaughter will have to reckon with it","675":"i read this book in one night i would have liked a little more detail about the jewish way of life as some of it was confusing to me i think with a little more detail i would have appreciated the characters more","676":"an excellent book that gives an insight into the lives of the hasidic jews","677":" as eastern europe is fractured during world war ii the satmar rebbe of transylvania makes a miraculous escape to america and begins building a new community in the williambsurg neighborhood of brooklyn new york meanwhile those of his transylvanian followers who survive the war are dispersed throughout europe zalman stern his wife hannah and their growing family end up in paris where they are eventually joined by two young orphans josef was the only survivor of the brutal murder of his family rescued and raised as her son by their christian maid several years later josef rescues mila after her parents are killed chasing after a train the very train on which the satmar rebbe is leaving when both children end up in the care of the sterns mila remains with them to be raised as a sister to their eldest daughter atara while josef is dispatched to williamsburg to study with the rebbe himself josef and mila will be reunited a few years later when their marriage is arranged the sterns' daughter atara will find herself on a different path her curiosity about the secular world surrounding her family in paris raises questions she is emphatically discouraged from pursuing but she can't ignore them while mila and josef become more deeply entrenched in the satmar way of life atara will become estranged from it and ultimately from her family the title of i am forbidden can be interpreted several ways within the context of the novel women in the satmar sect are forbidden from furthering their educations or working they have no role outside the family their most important job is producing children and one of their greatest responsibilities related to that job is the preservation of family purity the rules that govern sexual relations between husbands and wives sex is for procreation only and a wife must carefully track her cycles there are several days each month when her husband is forbidden to touch her at the end of that time she partakes in a ritual bath and returns home to give her husband a sign that he is now permitted to be with her this permitted time should coincide with her most fertile days and if all goes well she won't have unclean days again for months however pregnancy will make her forbidden again a wife who does not produce children has failed at her job and after ten years her husband may divorce her it can be hard for a modern woman to understand how any woman in this day and age could accept living like this which is why it's key to understand that living like this is a deliberate rejection of anything modern and can only be perpetuated within a community that chooses to close itself off from the world exposure to unsanctioned ideas from the outside can raise questions questioning can undermine an individual's belief and individual questioners may ultimately break down a community of believers questioning is why atara stern had to leave her family behind markovits has atara leave the story behind along with her family as the remainder of the novel focuses on mila her story is probably more interesing from the outside because her life is so unfamiliar but at the same time the narrowness of mila's life makes her story more challenging to tell while markovits rises to that challenge for the most part when she tries to take mila out of her life's confines the novel takes a turn that i thought was unfortunately soap operatic although i continued to be pulled along by the story my appreciation for it diminshed a bit over the last third of the book anouk markovits' writing is lovely and she has attempted some ambitious storytelling in i am forbidden the novel spans decades and explores a way of life that seems to exist alongside our own time rather than of it it touches on matters historical political and religious while focusing on one family's story i don't think all of it worked but i appreciate it when an author reaches the way this one does and while i didn't find the novel entirely satisfying i did find it consistently engaging interesting and emotionally resonant","678":" what do you do when religious law and life collide this is a disquieting story about two young girls who have very different reactions to their religious upbringing beautiful tender and so heartbreaking as i mentioned after reading unorthodox the scandalous rejection of my hasidic roots understanding the beginnings of the hasidic movement makes these stories characters much more tragic i have both read and heard tell that some believe this to be autobiographical so either way anouk markovits does an excellent job portraying the lives of the one who left and the one who stayed and neither women had it easy last anouk marovits lived in a satmar community until she was nineteen after leaving she went on to get her bs at columbia her ma at harvard and her phd at cornell her first novel pur coton roman is written in french this book she wrote in english and this after living in an incredibly isolated world obviously anouk markovits is bad ass","679":"i knew absolutely nothing about this particular sect of judaism and it was a fascinating read","680":"a page turner life gives us choices are we brave and daring enough to choose freedom and happiness","681":"this book was quite hard work to read and i can't really say it was worth it","682":" this is a story about 2 women who were raised together in a satmar hasidic family one the natural daughter of the family and the other adopted one is very religious and traditional while the other longs for a secular education and makes the difficult choice to leave the insular satmar community the story spans the post war period from the 1940's eastern europe to williamsburg brooklyn in the present day a fascinating look at history faith and family and their impact on the choices we make my only complaint is that as the book progresses the focus is more on one of the sisters markovits doesn't tell us as much about the other sister which left me feeling that the book was somehow incomplete otherwise i would have given it 5 stars","683":"the style of writing was so bizarre and hard to get used to i didn't care about any of the characters either i kind of wish we followed atara's story instead i think it would have been more interesting i don't recommend this book at all the only good thing is i learned a bit about satmar","684":"it was interesting to read about the hasidic culture and while the author made some strange plot choices i enjoyed the book","685":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits is an intimate and tender revelation of the private and reverent world of the strict hasidic sect the satmar this generational story is both a delicate and harsh division in one family whose one polar opposite is deeply rooted in the full conviction of its piety complete obedience and practice of its extreme spiritual traditions to the other spectrum of yearning for independence through secularism and modernity the narrative is beautifully written a clear and tender exposition that reads naturally and easily without the difficulty that is sometimes associated with getting through a text markovits writes with light lyricism and vulnerable honesty that her characters though flawed render the reader deeply empathetic zalman stern's character is synonymous with his name a serious committed and devout man of the torah and the hasidic law honouring always its doctrine as the first and foremost priority in his life--or rather embodying in the best way he can a lifestyle that is worthy in honouring hashem hannah is zalman's dutiful and honourable wife a loving and humble matriarch obedient in accordance to the role of wife and mother in the satmar community but the tension in the novel as well as in the stern family begins with the gradual disintegration of faith by atara daughter of zalman and hannah and the further observance and spiritual conviction of mila their adopted daughter as the two young women make their separate choices between selfless abandon into the faith and the difficult decision to abandon family and its beliefs the story delves deeper into a territory of which there are no black and white clear or simple answers--whether they be from the literal translations of the torah or the social acceptability and constructs of secularism to read more of this review you can visit the bibliotaphe's closet blog

glimpse of family life through the eyes of two girls raised as sisters i appreciated the fact that markovits shows us both the good as well as the bad side of the faith as i read i kept running to the computer to look up different jewish terminology it was a learning experience the story its self went down a path i didn't quite expect it's a very heartbreaking read that left me feeling unsettled","687":"great story but so heart wrenching","688":"i was so looking forward to this one but had to abandon ship i just did not care for the writing style at all what a disappointment","689":"this is a very disturbing glimpse into a closed community and the secrets and secret rites that feed it i found it hard to get into but couldn't put it down once i did","690":" i am forbidden by anouk markovits was an unexpected read for me and i am totally in awe of this book it revolves around the hasidic jewish culture from the time of the holocaust through the present josef is an orphan who is rescued by his christian maid and lives with her as his second mother and as a christian until he is taken back to the hasidic community in america mila is another young orphan adopted into a hasidic family as one of their own she and her sister atara grow up together until mila marries josef in an arranged marriage and atara is eventually disowned by the family for not following the strict rules of the religion the story then mainly follows josef and mila and the one big event that will effect them and their heirs for all future generations the total devotion to this strict religion was written so emotionally and beautifully and it was very powerful to me in short sections and even single paragraphs the author is able to convey passage of time and events the story explores what the characters do when what they know and feel in their heart does not conform to what is expected by their extremist religion it was sin for the sake of redemption descent for the sake of ascent","691":"from 1939 transylvania to 2012 new york i am forbidden tells the story of an orthodox girl and her relationship with her adopted family the jewish community her religion and her husband i had very high expectations for this book as many people raved about it but to be honest i found the first 100 pages very boring and tedious this story is nothing special and i was glad when i finished","692":"i didn't like this book very much but i finished it anyway i have a hard time enjoying intolerance and misogyny even when it is historically or religiously accurate i had a similar problem with middlemarch this is the story of several generations of hasidim starting near the end of wwii in transylvania and ends in williamsburg insularity is not charming","693":"post wwii story of hasidic jews two are orphans one is the daughter of a prominent rabbi it was translated from french i think it lost something in translation","694":"sad book parents killed infidelity and suicide heartbreaking i also wouldn't be a good hasidic jew i would never make it to heaven","695":"i didn't know a lot about the satmar culture i thought the story was well written i did find the beginning a little confusing but the overall story was interesting females do not have a lot of opportunity in this culture the author was raised this way and left but it isn't a memoir","696":"this novel is indeed a very interesting story of the ultra orthodox jewish community exposing its details and interpersonal relationships i found it emotional informative and very revealing in spite of the fact that it is fictional it is based on the author's experiences in living and ultimately leaving this religious community","697":" i haven't received my copy yet just received notice i had won 3 2

to him the family has an actual daughter close to mila's age atara and they become fast friends and sisters as they grow up mila becomes more religious and atara has found there is a whole lot more out there than their religious beliefs this story follows them through their decisions and the consequences and how it shapes their lives holy $@ okay i live very close to a secular fundamentalist religious cult so this story shouldn't have shocked me but wow it sure did i didn't understand the strict almost cruel rules to the orthodox jewish religion what an eye opener i thought the local cult was an anomaly i guess not i went through a time that all i read about was the jewish people and the treatment they received in the camps i always wondered why so many stayed around and didn't flee when they heard what was happening to other jews i think i understand a bit better now the story was interesting enough i hated several of the characters and i found the writing a bit difficult to read at times i am assuming this was a translation and that may account for the difficulty in the reading at times","698":"this is the story of two children who survived the holocaust that destroyed

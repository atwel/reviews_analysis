review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wolf in white van is one of the most imaginative evocative and vivid novels i've read in a decade that such a thoughtful and disturbing story fits into just 210 pages is a testament to author john darnielle whose every word packs a poetic punch no wonder his day job is a songwriter it is a modern day catcher in the rye it follows a first person protagonist a young man who is shaped by a singular tragic moment and how in the aftermath he sees the world with such a narrow innocence wolf in white van is one of the most imaginative evocative and vivid novels i've read in a decade that such a thoughtful and disturbing story fits into just 210 pages is a testament to author john darnielle whose every word packs a poetic punch no wonder his day job is a songwriter it is a modern day catcher in the rye it follows a first person protagonist a young man who is shaped by a singular tragic moment and how in the aftermath he sees the world with such a narrow innocence that it is full of wisdom unlike holden caufield though darnielle's main character sean carries his scars on the outside as much as the inside the result of a self inflicted shotgun wound his adjustment to life as a grotesquely disfigured man makes for a difficult but beautiful journey into a mind literally and figuratively full of puzzles following his recovery sean creates a surprisingly successful post apocalyptic choose your own adventure game called trace italian it is impossible to not feel sympathetic for sean who more than pity or acceptance just wants people to talk about him and his misshapen face honestly though at times you as the reader feel like the antagonist for wanting to know why he did this to himself why he doesn't want to get better why he put his family through this the same questions he his hounded with by his overbearing and unrelenting parents there is little resolution for sean by the end of wolf in white van other than the peace he has achieved and personal acceptance of his path nor for readers who still are left wondering why and what comes next that's intentional if not fitting no one ever reaches the trace italian as readers will note and still this is a book that will weigh on you for many years more","2":"a man with his face missing after an accident as a teenager lives a lonely life making his living from a mail order post apocalyptic game he wrote this book is not my usual read at all but instead of giving up i found myself fascinated by the story clever and well written it is unsettling and different worth the read but a book that really needs discussion and further reading to get to its meanings i think maybe its message or one of them anyway is that we are all really living a fantasy life role playing being our chosen selves the choices are so hard and we are really choosing blind we kid ourselves we are somehow in control","3":"this book is absolutely amazing the experience of a young man who goes through something traumatic i won't say more because discovery is half the enjoyment of the book and how he copes with the results the book at times almost veers into poetry in the beauty of the writing","4":"i don't get what the fuss is about many 5 star reviews but this one just didn't do it for me maybe it was the structure maybe i'm a traditionalist actually yes this is true but it just didn't move me","5":"just not my kind of book i just couldn't get into the story","6":"absolutely stunning","7":"i've never read anything like it fascinating","8":"4 5 5now i have even more proof that john darnielle is not only a great musician but also a great writer","9":" this is one of those books that was a little tough to get into at first in part because of its bleak premise that involves a world i'm not particularly interested in but as the book progressed i found that i was more and more hooked with each page and ended up reading about the last half of the book in one sitting a pretty unusual accomplishment for me the story is of a man named sean who has built a role playing game that people participate in over the mail which is just about the only outlet in his life after he suffered a terrible injury that left his face badly disfigured as a teenager the injury here and the circumstances surrounding it are really the story but it's slowly explained as sean reflects on moments in his post injury life that involve some other tragic moments tied to the mail game he has created sean's view of another person's tragedy given his own circumstances make for fascinating passages it's the end that really brings home how well done this book is i don't really consider this a spoiler because it's hinted early in the book and then outright mentioned by the halfway point but the accident that disfigured sean was a self inflicted gunshot wound in an apparent suicide attempt and the end with sean at last recollecting the night and the mindset leading to this incident are downright breathless and fascinating and when you get to the end it's not treated as some foolish decision or as that of a person so obviously disturbed that this is the only option he sees it's treated the way so many suicide attempts unfold in reality he's not a happy person but the cliche or never thought they'd go that far holds true as well it felt like just the right way of handling it i set the book aside and thought it over for maybe an hour afterwards my empathy for sean his parents and his friend kimmy all stuck with me for several hours afterward which is quite an accomplishment highly recommend","10":"often creative writing teachers will say you can see the writing showing through as a criticism an assertion that the characters are flat or the language to overwrought but in wolf in white van the writing is showing through and it is the crowning glory of the novel darnielle's musical background is not lost here the novel is as beautifully and carefully composed as a symphony the individual elements of plot are simple almost starkly so but it is the way he arranges them layering the components of the story masterfully into a haunting beautiful rhythm the novel is dark but the writing the care that is clear in the arrangement of details and words brings light to a dark landscape although sean the narrator is in no way a traditional hero or even a hopeful figure darnielle paints him in a softening light lending him a gentle and courageous persistence that makes the crippling tragedy of his circumstances bearable for the reader much of the novel centers around trace italian a text based game invented by sean as a way of escaping the fallout of his past and also as an escape for the people around the world who play it the game is turn based each turn the player is presented with a scenario more information about the world through which their character travels clues so to speak the novel itself plays out much like the game does presenting the information bit by bit sometimes scrambled as the reader makes their way through the landscape of sean's life the game itself is pieced together and explained throughout the novel and it expertly mirrors the piecing together of memory that sean attempts throughout the book the action of the story which is limited elevated as stated before by its careful artistic construction unfolds in reverse when sean unwittingly and irreparably influences the lives of two of the players of trace italian it is a catalyst for him to move backwards retracing his steps circling towards the singular tragic event of his past my one criticism of the novel is that it is perhaps a bit too veiled when it comes to the fate of the two players in question although it is revealed as carefully and piecemeal as the rest of the story i felt that the events were never quite clear enough i left the novel feeling fully satisfied with sean's story but feeling that some details some linear explanation of the tertiary story was left unsaid i was deeply curious concerned even over the fate of the other characters and wanted very much to know exactly how their story unfolded perhaps though this is intentional after all as is made clear from nearly the beginning of the book trace italian is an unattainable quest the resolution the trace italian itself a post apocalyptic sanctuary that the players journey toward is unreachable all of the answers of the game will never be revealed as readers darnielle has made us players too of an unwinnable game and in doing so raised haunting questions about the unknowable nature of our own actions","11":"unsettling captivating engaging i love darnielle as a lyricist and his writing chops are on par with his work with the mountain goats it might seem as though this book is simply written but you realize at the end that it is a very complex read much like the trace italian gamers readers can't wait to see how the book ends","12":"this is a fascinating portrait on what it is to be a teenager and how the decisions made while trying to make meaning can stay with you and haunt you forever","13":"wow that was amazing so moving i loved every second of reading that book i was engrossed from beginning to end","14":"as good as his music","15":" i have never read anything quite like this and i really liked it john darnielle is an excellent writer and the lyrical poetic quality of the book hinted of darnielle's roots as a lyricist he is the writer and vocalist for the band the mountain goats i loved how the story followed the wandering mind of the main character sean phillips and how his imagined world and real world were seamlessly blended together i also thought sean's mail based subscription game trace italian was really interesting i liked seeing the connection sean had with the people who played his game and i liked how the game often mirrored sean's own life this book is just so complex and interesting and it gave me a lot to think about it's different and it's good","16":"this was cool and quirky it's a 2015 alex winner and i think it definitely does have a lot of teen appeal maybe especially to kids who are interested in gaming fantasy type things it left me wanting to know more about sean and his mindset but i suppose part of the point is that sean himself doesn't know or can't explain what happened","17":" i never rewatch movies or tv shows unless i'm showing them to my wife or kids i don't replay games i can't tell you the last time i read a book that i had already read before the second i finished wolf in white van i had to read it again for being only 225 pages wiwv has more layers than books three times as long the unusual chronology of the book had me jumping back to previous chapters finding new meaning in passages that were previously opaque and allowing me to find the demons previously hidden this is a tremendously sad book but one that still manages to be warm and full of life","18":" at the end of wolf in white van i thought to myself we are in an age where anyone can write a book and get it published that's not the first thought i want after reading a book i was looking forward to this book after hearing the review on npr and my college daughter's recommendation i was let down i found wolf in white van to lack character depth suffer from a lack of editing and to leave me with a milquetoast existentialist ending i felt that the tragedy of the protagonist sean phillips employed a writing tactic to sensationalize the main character to the reader providing repetitive insights into a tragically trapped world from a tragic decision the rationale that caused the tragedy never struck me as authentic it reminded me of how hbo's carnivale takes you into the unusual world of the 1930's carnival sideshow with its cast of believe it or not characters but i never believed that pre tragedy sean would ever have made the choice he did the death of lance and carrie was a tragedy and again i felt like it was a writer trick remove the two devices and you have nothing neither lance nor carrie were compelling characters the references to 80's pop culture seemed self nostalgic and the entire role playing game could have provided intrigue or a strong parallel to sean's experience instead it just was like a box of abandoned dungeon's u0026amp dragons on a shelf in the attic i would have loved to have seen him play out the threat from lance u0026amp carrie's friends and have sean become trapped in a real world example of the game where he had to make decisions and fight for his survival to develop a reason to live but that's not how it went at the end i was left with disappointment i like the mountain goats john's band i think the songs are good and matter i wish the book matched the quality of the music","19":"4 and not 5 because i don't really know how i feel yet i feel like this kid is not a fictional character he is someone i know this is because his story isn't neat and tidy not all the questions are answered and 1 1 definitely does not add up to 2 i found this under scifi fantasy but it is really a story about a fan growing up in 1980s scifi culture","20":"this book is dark as anything but i found it tremendously compelling and i absolutely loved it and i wished it had gone on far beyond it's spare 207 pages sean is isolated from nearly everyone except nurses due to a horribly disfiguring injury at the age of seventeen and his only real contact with the outside world is in the form of trace italian trace italian is a text based role playing game that he invented as a coping mechanism during his long recovery and hundreds of players subscribe however some players take the game too far and sean himself may be dangerously imbalanced i've seen wide ranging reviews of this book it must really depend on the reader and the place that they are coming from i would highly recommend this book for adult readers particularly those with an interest or a past history of rpg play","21":"a great great book that i likely see myself reading again in the future it chugged along mind blowingly for a while but it ended with what i'm starting to see as the typical post modernist ending which i'm not entirely sure i like yet but right now i'm erring on the positive side i need to become less generous with the 5 star button on here but this one is definitely worth it recommend to all","22":"i wish there was more","23":"a character study more than anything else there wasn't much of a story but there were enough questions i wanted answered that it held my attention until the end probably should've been shortened to a novella or with the addition of a story could've existed as a slightly longer novel extant threads from camus' the stranger or an indie movie that tried just slightly too hard i guess the main problem i had with it was that it had plenty of room for a story thread where someone starts making terrific progress toward the trace italian which is supposed to be unattainable but it didn't happen at all it's even hinted at a little early on and it would've been a fun sort of cat and mouse thing to happen amidst all of this background stuff that instead of being allowed to be great background stuff is the main story here basically it needed a story and there wasn't one so all of the stuff that happened in this novel was intriguing background for a story that never came","24":"a rather interesting read the structure of the novel is a bit different than the linear fashion i am so accustomed to but that is what i'm told makes it so unique a rather interesting writer but meanders a bit at times makes me want to listen to the mountain goats and their albums","25":"all of my friends who read wolf in white van mentioned something about a chapter detailing hundreds of blue crabs skittering through a convenient store in search of mambas and becoming angry when all they can find is starburst i think my copy of wiwv was missing that chapter","26":" this book is a literary character driven exciting and mysterious quick read the story is centred around an accident that the main character sean phillps has when he is very young to cope he crafts an imaginary post apocalyptic world where the trace italian is the only sanctuary the world morphs into a role playing game played through mail correspondence it's similar to choose your own adventure and dungeons and dragons however players mail in their next move and the author sean responds by sending back the appropriate scene things go too far however when two teen players suffer a tragic end by taking the game too far and trying to play it in real life the book unfolds in reverse until we arrive at both the beginning and the climax and we find out the event that has shaped so much of sean's life i found this book to be beautifully and almost poetically written john darnielle has a gift for imagery and i loved how he was able to make me see and feel sean's disfigurements with only a slight salt and peppering of clues throughout the book i wanted to continue reading this book every time i was forced to put it down the characters that darnielle paints are rich and interesting and it also left me wanting to play trace italian i'm a lover of role playing games so the personal connection to this world likely helped me sink my teeth into it if you like role playing games beautiful prose and or interesting characters you'll love this book","27":" i've previously been a mountain goats fan and that was enough to get me to pick up the book to keep this short this is quite a weak book sean the narrator is neutral beyond belief and his narration draws his parents as even less than 2 dimensional figures they are flat as wallpaper there is just nothing about sean's narration that rings true the jacket makes it sound like the lance and carrie story will carry this story somewhere but that is a total thematic dead end this book really has nothing to say while i appreciate the world of choose your own adventure via mail that ends up being the most interesting part of the book i wouldn't recommend","28":"have you ever had a moment where you did something really stupid or something you regretted and you think back to why or how you did it you try to trace that decision back to its origin but in doing so you bring up all sorts of other memories and side stories and when you finally finish thinking about these things you realise you don't know why you did that stupid thing at all wolf in white van felt like that to me written in reverse chronological order the chapters of wolf in white van plot the choices taken by a disfigured game designer that led him to his present situation this is a reflective story more a set of curated memories than a narrative and in this way it is a unique book but the disjointed jumps in the protagonists life the cryptic vignettes like the title for instance that is a reference to subliminal messages hidden on old rock records and the lack of a major conflict might challenge readers who like there stories a bit more straight forward","29":"oof it's no surprise darnielle has a wonderful prose style but he also has great plot control the reverse chronology and extensive flashbacks actually work i feel like i need to reread immediately because i'm certainly he planted seeds in the earlier chapters the effect for me towards the end was a barreling towards the inevitable and while the ending could have felt abrupt it felt right","30":"probably closer to 3 5 stars but i'll bump to 4 for originality this is definitely an author to watch loved the 1st half or so but it got increasingly confusing as it went along not sure what happened at the end","31":" complex without ever beating you over the head with it a novel that splits its time between explaining the aftermath of a tragedy and fleshing out a series of sketches impressions flights of the mind that led an adolescent boy to make his own du0026amp d style role playing game functioning at the snail's pace of the usps the game is called trace italian the real story of this book is the life of sean the life he stepped away from by making one wrong turn wolf in white van reminded me of something chuck palahniuk might write if all of his flashy writing was stripped off stylistically and the story focused deeper on emotion as it stands though the emotion here is 3 4 death and maybe as high as 1 4 indifference i liked darnielle's previous book the 33 1'3 book masters of reality that was about a different adolescent boy in a mental facility who is filling up his notebook with a long stream of thoughts he has on his own life and where black sabbath and ozzy osbourne fit into it wolf in white van has many elements from that shorter novella but is missing some of the more manic fire however that's not a knock against it the narrator sean as disfigured and crushed by life as he is doesn't have much fire left and the sequence of events we have here are unfolding how they will no rush felt the disappointment i felt at the end of the novel was my own fault i wanted more from it from the pieces that were assembling this beguiling game trace italian these strange children who are fanatical about the game the court proceedings the death threats the resolution that seemed to be building what we get in wolf in white van is instead more mature than that because by the time the novel ends our narrator is no longer a teenage conan fanboy he's an adult and he knows how the world works and how the world tends to hold back its magic if you look too hard for it","32":" for such a strong promise this really didn't deliver for me the writing is beautiful in some places and completely over the top in others for such a short book i wasn't expecting 4 pages of code or a whole section on a completely unrelated matter man in the van we learn so little of the trace or the two young people who go to such lengths to play it part of me has to think that i've finished a 200 page story where the relevant parts could have taken up 50 i can understand some of the good reviews but for me the premise of the book was outdone by a narrator i really couldn't empathize with considering i'm a fantasy nut and spent many of my formative years obsessed with magical kingdoms this really surprised me hence the 2 stars","33":" you have found a book what do you do next a read bookb listen to audiobookc watch made for tv adaptationd trash book before you waste your timei chose a i should've gone with d having been surrounded by avid tabletop gamers the past six years and been privy to their somewhat eccentric conversations regarding their games i thought i might enjoy how this book was based around sean's creation of his own role play game alas i was so very wrong by only a third of the way through it was clear that the author wasn't going to explain whatever the traumatic event was until the bitter end that choice negatively impacted the entire story as it lessened sean's recollections of events that occurred between the incident and current day those stories would have become so much more powerful if we readers had been able to understand why they were so meaningful to sean when we were reading about them my other big gripe was the incessant time jumping between recollections with no rhyme or reason behind it i hardly need a story to be fully linear but if you're going to jump around at least have it serve a purpose start with a mid 20s memory go back to youth jump forward again and show how each of those experiences build on one another as it was it was nothing more than a hodgepodge of random memories and when it came to the game it was seriously lacking of course the whole conceit was that sean designed it as a kid and never altered it once written well that showed the game descriptions were unbelievably elementary and we're talking a basic choose your own adventure style so that's saying something my game designer side has absolutely zero respect for this part of the book if you don't know how to create a unique game or one developed enough to matter then don't include it in your story game over","34":" i'd have to say that my favorite book if pressed is russell banks' rule of the bone it isn't an epic tale nor is it particularly obtuse it is a story about a kid that most would write off as a nothing that's similar to wolf in white van although you don't realize how truly lonely sean is until the final chapter these books are important because they remind you that every person around you has at their core the essence of humanity when you reject them you reject humanity i'm certain that this book is grappling with more than that and i encourage you to read it to find out what it could mean for you for me it grabs me by the shoulders and says look at them know them","35":" a hauntingly spare meditation on the choices we make and their consequences and yet despite this topic sentence y statement the part about the consequences is the part of the book where the narrator sean turns his back on the reader one gets the sense that much more has gone on throughout the tale but we are left much like a player of the game trace italian which is detailed in quite a thorough manner throughout the book despite the flaws of unexplored themes and unanswered questions what's left after that is a beautifully bleak world of mail order catalogs trinity broadcasting network and conan the barbarian what's left after the surgeries and the treatments is a look inside a very specific mind even if we are left with more questions than we had when we first entered","36":"3 5 5 i enjoyed it quite a bit reads quickly and is interesting the entire time some elements feel a little half baked but the general theme of escapism is captivating","37":"maybe my favorite thing i've read since wells tower","38":"dylan's suggestion author is the guy from the mountain goats i really liked it especially all of the emotions that he pulls from his handicapped life placing them in his board game the trace italian also like how the story is told in reverse","39":"told in somewhat disjointed order part flashback part flash forward part delusion by a clearly unreliable narrator this novel did an excellent job of getting into the mined of a very troubled young man the strength of the narrative is the ubiquitous amount of ambiguity which is created by the disjoined arrangement of the narrative itself excellent evocation of the loneliness we all face at times and a precise exploration of the stresses that a disabled family member can create for those that are in charge of care additionally the creation of the mail order role playing game as an ostensible macguffin is in itself a marvel id like to play trace italian i look forward to more novels by darnielle","40":"very well written but in terms of content not an easy story to read darnielle does a stunning remarkable job of getting inside the head of a troubled young man repeatedly i found myself in awe of darnielle's descriptions of the manner in which the protagonist views and interacts with the world this is a powerful portrait of a once psychotic individual darnielle also does a good job in the structure of his narrative from the beginning the reader is shown that something unfortunate has happened in the past but only over the entire course of the story are these events unfolded best of luck in there","41":" john darnielle is quite possibly the best songwriter alive today to those who know and love his work this is hardly hyperbole wolf in white van feels very much like one of his songs drawn out into 200 pages in some ways this works in others it falls short the novel serves as a wonderfully detailed glimpse into the life of its main character sean phillips and how it has been ever altered by a choice made in his youth as intricate as our look in to sean's life is many of the other plot points seem unfinished or unnecessary the most moving and important moments come unexpectedly and maybe that was a conscious choice by the author a testament to life and the sometimes strange things we attach meaning to by another author this book may have earned a three star rating from me but darnielle's unique style and perspective bumped it up to a four if you are hoping for a sweeping epic with twists and turns this isn't the book for you if you want a unique study on life and the decisions we make that shape it give it a read","42":"i'm sad that i can never again read this book again for the first time about 1 4th of the way through i knew i was reading a special book and about 1 2 of the way through i began to suspect i may be reading one of my favorite novels of all time it engrossed me in a way that few novels have done the story unfolds puzzle piece by puzzle piece forming a picture that keeps echoing in my mind darnielle's prose is beautiful and evocative in way that never becomes showy and he leaves you with many thoughts to mull over in both the fictional world of the novel and the real world in which we live it sounds trite but truly this book was amazing","43":"excellent debut novel from the lead singer lyricist of the mountain goats it's the story of a young man horrendously disfigured by a suicide attempt who invents a role playing mail rpg what the story lacks in focus it reads more of a tone poem than a plot driven narrative it makes up in exceptional writing and a kind of immersion into the wrecked but not wrecked life of the main character","44":"i really wanted to like this book it does have imagination and invention it also has a thread thin plot that doesn't go anywhere i kept waiting for some big reveal and got more of the same young man lost in his misery this may serve as an anthem for the disaffected youth of america but i choose not to relate to it","45":"darnielle's novel is articulate and quietly intense it's personal yet vague in its emotions every word feels labored over but the result is a fluid easy read sean is a difficult protagonist but his strength is derived from his difficulties he knows who he is and why he does the things he does but he is also baffled by his actions and tangential thoughts trace italian is a simple game but it has the power to lure people in blurring the line between fantasy and reality darnielle is an incredible songwriter and apparently a flawless writer i loved this book and everything else i read feels cheap now","46":" received a signed arc copy at bookcon 2014 so i must be really dumb because this book is either the greatest piece of literature that has ever been written or it's a bunch of nonsense i may be bias but uh i vote nonsense i'm sorry but what was the point is it supposed to be introspective haunting i'm confused i still don't even know why sean did what he did hell i'm sure sean doesn't even know why he did what he did also all that angst please that was why i hated cather in the rye i definitely don't recommend this one i don't even know how or why i even finished it i might have to let this one go from my shelf real talk","47":"eh this was fine","48":"would of have given it 5 stars but started off a little pretentious once i got past the first 2 chapters though it was a very fun read that was different from anything else i have personally read","49":"i can't wait to read this again","50":"beautifully written this is one of the most quietly menacing books i have read in a while it is not that the character is menacing it is that with every turn of the page there is this build up to something big and life changing and as a reader you are seeking for the meaning behind it all but there is sometimes a grace to having no meaning at all it is a quick read and i almost flipped back to the beginning and started reading it all over again","51":"this books was incredible the entire novel is a modern reflection on free will who has control is life a game being played by someone else in their spare time it has a fascinating and fresh character with a mysterious backstory that isn't revealed fully until literally the last page of the book","52":"unique and interesting a perfect college read i would have flipped over this 12 years ago glad i read it not at all similar to ready player one which i was secretly hoping for this is very dark and tricky for me to review","53":"really original really engaging definitely recommend","54":"series some readers of both say these two works tread on similar ground troubled adolescents heavy metal tapes this one seems a little more developed and intricately woven read more on the booklog indie rock fans of a certain age might know john darnielle better as the frontman of or the solo act known as depending on the era the mountain goats wolf in white van is his second work of fiction he previously wrote a ya novel called master of reality about the black sabbath album for the 33 1\/3  series some readers of both say these two works tread on similar ground troubled adolescents heavy metal tapes this one seems a little more developed and intricately woven read more on the booklog","55":"one of the best books i read this year thoughtful prose surprised how much i liked it","56":"i don't get it i don't understand why i enjoyed parts of the writing but i really need to know why why someone needs to explain this book to me i'm not sure i would recommend it very dark","57":"i really appreciate when an author lets a story reveal itself little by little and darnielle does it deftly in wolf in white van this is a short book with a lot of details left to the readers imagination the story is told out of sequence generally working backwards towards the incident that first changes the life of sean when he was 17 he gives you enough hints to lead you to the inevitable conclusion but any reader with an imagination will feel the jolt of it no matter how much you expected it","58":"this was an unusual book still trying to figure out why he did what he did may have to re read it at some point","59":"i love john darnielle's music and i loved this book really compelling prose and seriously haunting","60":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here don't read my stuff my stuff is no good and it's just for me this isn't a review it's just a spew of thoughts i can turn back to in the future when i've forgotten the details spellings are off because i listened didn't read jd read the audio that made it great sean phillips main character shot himself in the face with a rifle for no reason other than that it was one of a number of possibilities and that's the one he chose or maybe he felt like an outsider and wanted to do something to don't read my stuff my stuff is no good and it's just for me this isn't a review it's just a spew of thoughts i can turn back to in the future when i've forgotten the details spellings are off because i listened didn't read jd read the audio that made it great sean phillips main character shot himself in the face with a rifle for no reason other than that it was one of a number of possibilities and that's the one he chose or maybe he felt like an outsider and wanted to do something to make that be the case he ended up disfigured and tiptoed around his parents couldn't take care of him due to emotions and financial limitations there was nobody to sue to become whole the thing wasn't anybody's fault except for sean's while he was in the hospital he came up with a by mail choose your own adventure game called trace italian an anglicized version of the name of some sort of ancient fortification he'd send out moves to players that ended in four options players would choose an option and that would dictate the next move there wasn't a practical end but the theoretical one was getting safely to the trace italian the game was set in a post apocalyptic world where there'd been a nuclear meltdown or something and there were mutants all around the trace was in kansas the game started in california a player named chris haynes ended his gameplay by writing in that he had killed himself in the game but not in real life as he made clear players named lance and kerry played together and at some point started acting out in real life their moves this resulted in them out in the cold somewhere digging a hole with no food and freezing starving to death in kerry's case or nearly to death lance sean was sued in connection with that incident but the case was dismissed there's a bit in the book about sean watching a christian broadcasting show about backwards messages in music wolf in white van comes from a discussion in that show about some christian rock song that contains that message if played backwards it's unclear what wolf in white van means i'm going to stop writing now so i can do work i need to do hope this is enough to remind my future self what this book was about kimmie chris more","61":"i appreciate the inventiveness of the game and the vary accurate depiction of adolescence and obsessive creativity but there was a certain lack of depth... in the central character not sure it felt like a lengthened version of a new yorker fiction piece","62":"tried a little too hard i liked a lot of the pop culture references including one to an sf book by a local couple but there was too much left ambiguous and it just felt like a poorly chosen stylistic trick i'd read another book by the same author though","63":"this book is not for everyone but it was the type of book that should not be read quickly it demands to be read slowly and savored the words phrases and order of the book are all very intentional and intense after reading reviews i'd expected to have a big shocking ending but this book is not like that it doesn't build up and then burst it's a slow intense burn that will leave its mark for a long time i really enjoyed the name and how it relates to the book and the metaphor it draws for the book as a whole for now i'll put this down and likely read it again when i'm ready for some more favoring","64":" john darnielle has a very distinctive prose style long lyrical sentences that weave paragraphs that gain weight as much from the complex route they travel as from the content they convey he narrates the audiobook version of wolf in white van and brings to the text a calm almost uninflected but never boring tone that speaks of intelligence imagination disengagement patience and hopeless endurance the narrative of wolf in white van is a mobius strip of continuous stream of consciousness punctuated with ellipses in both content and thought that have the effect of making your imagination fill in the gaps and impose a pattern the content of wolf in white van is a walk through the mind sean phillips a broken scarred isolated man who spends more time in his head than in the real world and perhaps more time in his imagination than in his memories or his current experiences although he can't be entirely certain of this this is a clever book beautifully designed skillfully told and deeply original it is also a very unsatisfying book not because the content is unpleasant or because almost nothing happens or even because of the self consciously intellectual presentation but because the solipsism at the heart of the novel is sterile when i'd unfurled the plot and understood the path that sean phillips had traveled i really didn't care at one point in the novel the origin of the title is explained wolf in white van was alleged to be a satanic message that could be heard when a larry norman song was played backwards when as a boy sean phillips hears this allegation he wonders why the devil would go to all the trouble of writing his message backwards if he really wanted it to be heard i felt pretty much the same way about this novel it is a puzzle that is more interesting than its solution a game that is about the journey and how we bring our own lives into that journey when we populate gaps and impose patterns claiming the narrative and altering the story rather than being about the revelation of the plot if this kind of thing appeals to you you'll be giving this wolf in white van five stars personally i gave it three because it reminded me of a tinguely sculpture elaborate ingenious but lacking in emotional impact","65":"i enjoyed this book immensely i've never had an author capture so perfectly what it feels like to be an outsider growing up and what it feels like to have thoughts and imaginings that no one else in your experience has i also have to say that i really really want to play trace italian","66":" this book is a punch in the stomach it was haunting and gave me nightmares i wouldn't recommend it to most people i debated about 5 stars vs 4 i was hoping for a different ending but i've never read anything like this and as soon as i finished the book i wanted to read it again i will read it again i listened to the audiobook i didn't read it typically i think listening to a book diminishes my enjoyment but in this case the narrator was incredible he _was_ the character it was as if he were living in the book as opposed to simply reading it i'm glad that my first reading of this book was via audiobook as opposed to reading it though next time i'll read it instead so that i can compare the experiences as with every book i'd encourage people to avoid reading any summaries of the book before reading it better to be surprised by everything","67":" i know i'm a little old to say that a rock band changed my life but the mountain goats did the first time i heard \"this year\" on the mountain goats thousandth album no they haven't recorded a thousand albums but damn they're prolific the sunset tree something just clicked and i proceeded to listen to the song and the entire album for close to a year i of course listened to the mountain goats whole catalog and loved it john darnielle writes about the losers you went to high school with--who really weren't losers at all the song \"the best ever death metal band in denton\" is an excellent example of this kind of song you just didn't take the time to get to know them--the pain of growing older and being slightly disappointed with life of loneliness and the simple joys of being alive darnielle's debut novel wolf in white van resonates with the same verve energy and semi darkness that the mountain goats bring to the table and it might be that darnielle may actually be a better novelist than he is a songwriter yeah i know he's written hundreds of songs and only one novel so the statement is a bit of a stretch wolf in white van is the story of sean a former high school \"loser\" aka a jean jacket wearing heavy metal kid that is featured in more than a few mountain goats songs who is horribly disfigured and spends his days in his generic apartment with very little personal stimuli other than visits from an at home nurse and a by mail post apocalyptic role playing game he created while recovering from the accident--it's really more of an incident--which left him disfigured in the hospital called trace italian the game is also how sean makes his meager living sean's life is extremely lonely and dejected along with the isolation he feels because of his disfigurement he also feels rejected by just about everyone in his life including his parents probably one of the most single powerful and telling paragraphs in the novel is when after sean's grandmother dies his parents ask him not to attend the funeral because of his appearance and former friends even the complex imaginary world of trace italian has been tainted when we learn that two of the games players decide to go live action with the game and end up freezing to death and sean is now being sued for their deaths by the players families despite the grievous events that have shaped sean i never saw him as a tragic character i instead viewed him as an every man who like most of us is perfectly fine with simply rolling along with his existence and living his stripped down life and running trace italian would he want his life to be different of course but like most of us he's made missteps that he simply can't take back for those readers who are looking for a novel that contains big reveals and stunning life changing revelations which re shape the protagonist's world view you should probably steer clear of wolf in white van sean does not change he does not become a better person as his story ruminatively unwinds the only change sean experiences is considering reconstructive surgery at his at home nurse's suggestion however if you enjoy dark tender stories told in a distinctive lyrical voice wolf in white van will be a wholly satisfying experience","68":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here for the first third of this book i enjoyed being carried along by darnielle's deceptively simple writing it's got a nice rhythm to it which you expect from a song writer naturally unfortunately because of the structure of the book the cleanness of the writing ends up feeling thin and way too spare and towards the non ending it actually becomes very frustrating to read i can appreciate the idea of writing this in what is essentially a circle but because sean's suicide attempt has no bui for the first third of this book i enjoyed being carried along by darnielle's deceptively simple writing it's got a nice rhythm to it which you expect from a song writer naturally unfortunately because of the structure of the book the cleanness of the writing ends up feeling thin and way too spare and towards the non ending it actually becomes very frustrating to read i can appreciate the idea of writing this in what is essentially a circle but because sean's suicide attempt has no build up no concrete reason for it other than that he likes to daydream about blood and whatnot putting that at the climax results is a tremendous let down a more linear plot with sean's suicide attempt near the beginning and having to deal with lance and carrie at the end would've actually had a far more come full circle feel than this actual circle i get that darnielle was trying to show how the interior of the mind has an effect on your actions in the outside world but given how this story was set up you tend to expect something more conclusive or at least explanatory about the suicide attempt it's a shame because there are a lot of interesting ideas at play here and i can't help feel that most if not all of them were underdeveloped and underutilized this should've been longer there should've been more there there don't think i'd recommend it more","69":"pretty amazing for a debut novel definitely worth the short read especially if you're into the outsider loner type e g for whom the bell tolls the catcher in the rye","70":"really interesting premise and characters not sure i am rating this novel as high as it should be i listened to the audiobook when i was sick with pneumonia and think i need to go back and read the ending in print","71":"it's really just simple math the whole of it there are only two stories either you go forward or you die but it's very hard to die because all the turns pointing that way open up onto new ones and you have to make the wrong choice enough times to really mean it","72":" songwriting is not easy if anyone could write a good song then we wouldn't have enough accountants and there would be a lot more music out there to listen to song lyrics have to be both poetic and musical the best ones often tell a story this is how john darnielle the singer songwriter for the mountain goats writes his songs they often tell stories that are rarely autobiographical feature a discernible character and almost always offer a clear and poignant narrative of immense pain from what i've heard he always focuses in on characters that are hyper aware of themselves usually expounding on their weaknesses or their dark situations with a cheery and uplifting tune there is always something profoundly positive in the delivery this mismatch of light hearts and dark minds is exactly the way in which wolf in white van darnielle's debut novel is written that is to say that wolf in white van is very well written the reader is invited into protagonist sean phillips head in what is presumably his present day life we learn instantly that sean is a likeable person he is very human in the way he talks to us very kind to the people around him and his life seems peppered with very light hearted moments of intimate human contact he's a conan fan he's very funny he reads scifi religiously and he has a cool job writing mail in role playing games we also know that sean is horribly disfigured due to an accident in his adolescence he spends a lot of time in his head too and he'd like you to believe it is because of this accident but as we travel back to times before the incident it is obvious he was always this way this is important because the reader is often exposed to some very dark things whether in sean's past or his present thoughts we travel back with sean to traumatic moments he was a tortured teen that grew up to be a tortured individual his mind can go to some very disturbing places this play between the dark depths of sean's mind and the very beautiful touching moments he has with people often strangers serves to strengthen the emotional drive in each moment it also makes sean a very real and relatable person he isn't just a tortured man and he isn't the bastion of humanism this is possibly everyone's story but probably like everyone sean feels his disfigured face makes his trauma and anger his own and the beautiful connections he forges with others including the reader speak to an interconnectivity that perhaps is over sean's head this makes for a very empathetic read one that is at once ridiculously fun and funny and thought provoking not unlike a mountain goats song it's hard to say much more because so much of this novel is discovering sean and the terrifying places he has been both outside and inside his mind what makes this book so devourable is a sense of mystery what was the accident who is this person he is alluding to what lawsuit darnielle is laying out breadcrumbs crafting an openness and a willingness in sean that make what's behind the great big closed vault doors even more tantalizing this is true talent that i doubt will disappear as darnielle continues to write i can't wait to see what he does next musically or otherwise do yourself a favor and don't read any plot synopsis on like wikipedia before you read this book part of the reason this narrative is so powerful is the gradual way you learn what happens to sean i would say not to even read the back of the book","73":"starts slow but i ended up really liking it john darnielle should write more books","74":"what the actual ef brilliantly written but seriously twisted","75":"i'm feeling a little goldilocks about books right now but this hit the spot despite being rather grim i don't want to say too much about it as much of the appeal for me was the slow unveiling of both the immediate and previous trauma but this is about a man living after an extreme deformity except it's really about the seduction of imagination and finding home or meaning outside the day to day world","76":"john darnielle is just as good of a book writer as he is a song writer so very very good","77":"i wish this book was longer there's so much more i want to know but it got to me it's pretty heavy stuff","78":"i was interested in reading wolf in white van for a couple of reasons one the author is john darnielle not well known as a writer of prose but rather of music and at times the only member of the eclectic rock group known as the mountain goats secondly it's the only novel i've heard of that is about play by mail games i got into play by mail thirty some years ago most of them even those that exist today are computer generated but a few were actually done by hand the creator of the game would send you your situation and you'd respond by mail with what you would do next and he'd write back to tell you what happened to you in this book the narrator sean phillips owns a game company and his most popular game is called trace italian which has players in a zombie filled post apocalypse heading toward a safe haven in a fortress somewhere in kansas that's only part of the story though we quickly learn that sean is horribly disfigured by an accident that gradually reveals itself as a suicide attempt by rifle to the face the attempt was unsuccessful i did hope that at some point i'd be able to explain my recent theory that it isn't really possible to kill yourself that everybody goes on forever in multiple dimensions the other plot thread is that sean is being sued by parents of an impressionable teen who took the game so seriously that he and his girlfriend went to the plains and one died of exposure the world of play by mail is a by product of the role playing games that started in the '70s especially dungeons and dragons for those who didn't have the friends nearby and let's face it du0026amp d fans often could be short of friends the mail became a lifeline this world is aptly considered by darnielle who has sean beginning to create his world as a teenager knitting it together bit by bit especially when he is recovering from his self inflicted gunshot wound for those who play the games the escapism is apparent but what about those who create the worlds they are even further into their minds making a place where they can go in their heads the book hops back and forth between past and present leading to the day that sean shoots himself we try like truffle hunting pigs to discover the reasons why he does what he does he seems to be pretty normal if a nerd he is a great fan of robert e howard's conan stories even to the point where he buys a cassette tape by a band who writes all their songs about them the mountain goats have done similar things their latest has songs all about pro wrestling there are some great teenage angst bits like some things are hard to explain to your parents some things are hard to explain period but your parents especially are never going to understand them there are also philosophical statements that do not edge too far into pretentiousness or solipsism there are planets so far away from ours that no scientist will ever guess that they exist let alone know the stories of their civilizations their beginnings and ends they're not being kept secret from us but they're secret all the same as stated the book ends with an account of the day sean shoots himself it may be disappointing to some that there is no obvious trigger it seems like a normal day when he goes to a video arcade and makes out with a girl for the first time but so often incidents like these have no obvious answer and darnielle resists the obvious","79":"an intense read not exactly enjoyable but riveting","80":"i've spent the entire morning reading review after review of john darnielle's wolf in white van the debut novel from the mountain goats' singer that was long listed for the national book award after reading each five star review that lauds it for being life altering or mind bending i'm all \"fuuuuuck that noise \" i don't get it and i'm trying very hard to get it read more","81":"a ripe and damp novel about grief and escapism and aperspectival madness lovingly rendered in this swirling nonchronological story aka really good but sad and heavy","82":" overall i loved this book the writing is clean but still dreamy i found some places teetered on the thin line between for lack of a better word wanky and not but it never crossed it 'and them some secret forms in a distant nebula somewhere and somehow i get news of it and i close my eyes and fall weightless trough inner space for as long as i can stand it ' p37as a first person account of someone who is basically a hermit you could maybe expect it to be lacking in human interaction fortunately this recluse has a rich inner life and the writing moves between present and past from recent past to more distant past i knew from the outset this book moved in reverse that the events that shaped sean as we would know him were already long passed 'it sounded like he was making up the words as he went along reacting to a story in his mind as he watched it develop because he stopped in the middle of the sentence right after not the i liked it because it was how i felt not knowing what to say but wanting to say something saying something anyway because your mouth just keeps moving and the rhythm is behind you ' p198my main gripe with the book is that i wanted more depth of knowledge regarding the two main events that have affected sean so this left me wanting although i can see the sense in the lack of depth as this is how sean relates to the events distant he sees the sean moving through these events as someone almost entirely separate to him yes i recommend this especially if you are a fan of john darnielle already i do not think you will be disappointed with this first novel i look forward to more","83":"an extremely creepy book","84":" i liked the book overall i was intrigued by the trace italian and by the strange unraveling puzzle of sean's face the novel has a kind of reverse chronology to it in contrast to the forward drive of the trace game the last few pages of the novel almost won me over i only wish darnielle had done a bit more with this turn taking notion earlier on instead many pages went by at a time in which i felt pretty much adrift i'm quite impressed with darnielle's skill as a novelist it makes me respect his songwriting a lot more and it makes me interested in seeing what next novel this creative mind brings forth","85":"i have no idea what to say about this book really it's interesting reading a book that you know nothing about beforehand it's safe to say that this novel gave me the creeps but i liked the cryptic way it was written it somehow managed the balancing act of giving barely anything away yet somehow moving the story along","86":"i like the style of this novel it was short but it was written in a paused pace that seemed to fit the plot perfectly i like how we were led to discover the events of sean's life and how the trace italian world works and was built i like the introspection moments too how there are no easy answers and how sometimes life just passes just flows without other drama than the one we have created for ourselves and then there's fantasy","87":"a very fine eye for detail some nice scenes but none of this resonated with me on an emotional level","88":" while recovering from a disfiguring long term injury sean develops a role playing game called trace italian that takes place in an imaginary world for strangers to play in players write to sean to tell him their next moves and he responds with choices for them to continue their game no one has made it all the way to trace italian the final destination but he has quite a few players while this is a role playing imaginary game two high school students have decided to play the game in real life with tragic consequences these consequences are far reaching and cause sean legal trouble i had a hard time getting into wolf in white van i thought it was a very slow read and i almost gave up early into the book however it is a short book and a fairly quick read despite that i kind of wish i'd spent my time reading something i know i would have enjoyed more i'm not sure who i'd recommend this to but maybe older teens who enjoy role playing you don't learn too much about sean's accident until the end but there are clues along the way that help give you an idea of what happened to him","89":"i am loathe to write too much about wolf in white van as much as any book i can recall it's something i don't want to spoil in any fashion for potential readers it's a stunner a gem a cosmic gut punch and \"spoiling\" john darnielle's debut novel in any traditional sense isn't really possible i would argue that while the \"how and why\" details of the story comprise the central narrative questions the point of the book is the impossibility of answering them in any objective way like life itself you will have to take in and account for the minutiae the ephemera the seemingly meaningless details to even start to grapple with the idea of \"why\" a search for meaning and a desire for things to make sense are human instincts find the inflection points separate the genuine from the simulacra label the \"telling\" moments they also are components of a reader's expectation when picking up a book but in the end the meaning of any moment event or entire life is only a wholly subjective construct of an individual limited and shaped by his her experiences and choices or more often mindlessly inherited from others a \"dark smudge of an idea shared among believers \" as darnielle's narrator describes the idea of satanic messages purportedly encoded backwards into some music an exploration of finding meaning in others' actions is worthy profound fertile ground for a writer the genius of what darnielle achieves however is to have the central construct of the plot the book's narrative style the narrator's personal details and even the physical act of reading a book harmonize reflect and amplify each other if this sounds complicated meta and or naval gazing it's only due to my failure to effectively communicate darnielle's feat wolf in white van is deceptively simple elegantly designed and plainly and powerfully written upon finishing the final devastating page i spent the next half hour re reading key portions of the book i've returned to it several times since the further away i get from completing the narrative the more this book unpacks itself in my mind revealing new layers and concepts undiscovered feats and treasures wolf in white van is stunning i'm compelled to mention that darnielle is the lead singer of the mountain goats a band i've only vaguely heard of and have never actually heard there is undoubtedly an apt musical metaphor to be used here i'm not the guy to come up with it","90":"a while back on twitter i saw an author i can't recall exactly who it was describe how he had his friend purchase a book at the friend's recommendation on his kindle for him he then had the friend open the book to the first page so that he the author could start reading with absolutely no context of what it was he was even reading i wish i could do that for someone with this book it's essentially what i did myself i had heard this book mentioned briefly by someone and requested from the library but hadn't managed to get around to it finally tonight i sat down with the intention of starting it wanting something fresh to clear my head and was hooked from the first page as cliche as that sounds for this book it couldn't be truer something about the writing was evocative and mystifying drawing me in sentence by sentence until i finished in one sitting i don't want to give any plot description i honestly don't even want people to read the blurb on goodreads or the back of the book before reading this i'm not saying that because i think the description will ruin some sort of mysterious aspect of the story it won't i just think this book warrants untainted eyes going into it it's puzzling raw emotional and brilliant it's a book about grief and personal pain and guilt and coping with all of that it's a heavy book but a deeply moving story it's gripping and quotable and deliciously sinister it's a book that completely took me by surprise and it's easily one of my favorites i've read in 2015 i'm so happy to have had this experience with this book because that's what reading this book was for me an experience not a slow trudge through murky waters but a high speed chase down a southern california highway where you're news reporter the camera crew filming from the police helicopter a pedestrian waiting at the crosswalk and the burglar in the getaway car all at once","91":"a story told backward with beautiful prose it is about a disfigured man sean who created a mail away role playing game two of his customers decided to act out the game in real life and he gets taken to court because of the ramifications while we discover more about this court case we also learn more about why he looks the way he does and dive more deeply into his character","92":"so disappointed in this the book received so many rave reviews and i'm pretty sure this was the first book in a long time where i truly struggled to finish it hardly any dialogue descriptions were just too much his crazy mind was interesting at first but 210 pages of it and nothing else no thanks","93":" most cultural stuff even things that i love is essentially fungible if i never had a then it's okay because i'd still have b but this is not true of the music of the mountain goats i say this in all sincerity even though it makes me feel like a chump the music of the mountain goats has made my life better so i'm primed to love wolf in white van on the other hand i was often taken out of the story with the thought 'the mountain goats guy totally wrote that line ' like john darnielle's music the book is beautiful and concise the books clocks in at just over 200 pages and totally immersive in the experience of being this person yet there is something unknowable about the main character and while i feel like that's a purposeful choice the sum total of the book ends up frustratingly vague","94":" memories shape so much of our present reality we rely on them to control our progression into the future we see images both fondly and horrifically and we hear voices which occasionally navigate our consciousness when memories begin spinning they create a meta reality--one in which we partially exist this realm of haziness is where john darnielle's complex and often dazzling debut wolf in white van finds itself darnielle presents wolf in white van through the eyes of sean phillips sean is a young man who lives in two worlds--one that contains the hard memories of his past and another that mostly exists in the fantasy filled present sean never lets us too deep into his past we know that he has an extensive facial disfigurement but he withholds the cause for most of the narrative he like the story is full of surprises and mystery sean's world of fantasy is the one in which he spends most of his time because of his physical otherness he does not participate in the social world he feels that he cannot to make money and to connect sean creates an intricate through the mail game called trace italian the game relies on multifarious possibilities for player exploration sean must know projected paths before players request them after participants write in with their desired move sean mails them back the results play carries on back and forth until interest in the fantastical succumbs to reality sean tells us himself that knowing which world is real is a challenge he says \"sometimes i have trouble finding the edges \" he's not the only character who struggles with understanding reality lance and carrie are two frequent players of sean's trace italian they become so invested in the fantasy of the game that they take their play into the real world as the two characters discover fantasy sadly doesn't stand a chance in such a cruel dangerous world the unpleasant reality barges into sean's world too and the collision of reality and fantasy creates a surreal literary experience darnielle seems interested in examining the role physicality plays in society and the conclusion is that appearance dictates too much sean lives behind a curtain because he has to he retreats into his game because he has no other choice he hides in a small apartment by himself his family fears sean's appearance as much as any stranger on the street might the entire treatment of sean--by others and even by himself--is terribly sad and concerning yet it seems true when considering the society we live in today wolf in white van also shows an interest in religion another part of our world that exists beyond the collective us sean dabbles with thoughts but he never really embraces or ignores the possibilities surrounding him simple awareness permeates much of sean's life although wolf in white van is darnielle's debut novel the writing shows masterful precision the sentences come across as lyrical shifting slowing and maintaining a consistent voice the novel is tough but it's handled so well that you appreciate the structure rather than grow anxious by trying to understand every word of it john darnielle's wolf in white van is a coming to deal triumph for the melancholy read it decode it live it do whatever you want but you wont be able to forget it original review published at drunk monkeys http www drunkmonkeys onimpression","95":"this book is so good it makes me die a little bit knowing that i can never again read it for the first time i may actually buy it also because i don't want to have to keep taking it out from the library","96":"this guy is from my home town everyone liked this i feel like i was supposed to like this i should have liked this i did not like this i recognize merits but i never enjoyed it never felt committed to the main character never was anything bu mildly curious what the deal was i wish i'd fault moved haunted amazed like all the other readers i just felt the entire time bleh","97":"i finished this book a few days ago and did something i've never done before i flipped back to the first page and started it again an actual review is likely to follow in the near future after the reread","98":" as other reviewers have said i wanted to like this book as it got several raving reviews and i'm familiar with darnielle's music it was an intricately woven well written story and it had me intrigued all the way through although i'm not sure i was following where the sometimes tangential narratives were taking me having finished the story though i found nothing stick firmly with me it's worth a read for the quality of the writing but i didn't get the level of significance from it that other readers seemed to get","99":"when i heard john darnielle of the mountain goats had a novel coming out there was no question in my mind that i'd be gobbling it up as soon as i got my hands on it darnielle writes the most visceral lyrics i've ever heard with a knack for cutting right to the pain whether emotional or physical in just a line or two i got what i expected from wolf in white van's prose by the second paragraph every other day they'd bathe me and every time i'd feel like it wasn't so bad for a few minutes and then the heat would slacken the resewn flaps of my cheeks a little and the tingling would start up a rippling alarm traveling down confused wires if you figure the paragraph which precedes that one explains what's led up to that point of the narrator's life you're no expert figurer answers come in time but not all of them there are a couple of things going on here the telling leaps all over the story's timeline and it's meant to be disorienting there are times the reader isn't quite sure when an event is happening or which of the other narrative strands it might be connected to we're left to attach the pieces with little reference perhaps echoing the reassembly of the narrator and his life after the accident that is central to the story and centers are important here a little robert frost we dance round in a ring and suppose but the secret sits in the middle and knows there are many unknowable centers in the book from the imaginary fortress which sits right in the middle of the country and is the unachievable goal of the narrator's play by mail game trace italian to his motivation for the central act of the novel which may be unknown even to him to the unspoken feelings of so many of the characters it's the search for what lies in those centers that drive us on through the book and drive the characters through their inner turmoil the answers at the core of everything are cloaked in many layers of protection the innermost wrapping being the hardest and most inviting of them all the apprehension of the seeker darnielle lays out the story so we can see the ending coming and it's probably for this reason the last ten pages of wolf in white van filled me with dread","100":"actual rating 2 5 3 ish stars i'll be the first person to admit this i am not particularly intelligent and there are some forms of art that are completely lost on me i'm thinking that this book may be a good example of such an art this is the kind of book that i read in the course of one afternoon and spent the entire time feeling like i was keeping my head just above the water in terms of following the author's intention only to finish out the story with the notion that i was given some enormous revelation that should shake my foundation andd i've completely missed it let me tell you what this story is not 1 this story is not similar to ready player one by earnest cline although the synopsis may lead you to believe like it did for me that this story revolves largely around the text based rpg that our mc has created it does not at least not in the way that rpo revolves around its game the similarities between ready player one and wolf in white van begin and end with the plot point of there being a game that involves some element of nerd culture 2 this story will not take on you on the adventures inside of the universe constructed by the mc you'll receive glimpses of the game called trace italian but there is no action inside of the game to speak of 3 this story is not hugely about lance and carrie either their story and the legal repercussions that sean face are treated as a side note at best when i realized these three points the story became mostly a character study of sean the creator of the game and his experiences surrounding the tragedy he survived which left him disfigured unfortunately sean's story wasn't all that compelling at least from where i stand and i walked away from the book wanting like i said i feel as though i missed out on some giant revelation that made this book great maybe someday i'll wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and finally get it but until then","101":"more of an outline of novel than an actual novel seems like he writing ideas down more than writing a novel the game by mail idea is really great and could have been a beckettesque mindfuck but is just kind of frustratingly sketched out","102":"man okay i feel like i should have more to say about this book because there is a lot in there for such a relatively short work it was really good though heartbreaking beautiful etc all the stuff you want a book to be i would've liked it to be longer to spend more time getting to know sean and the world s he inhabits to try to make sense of his act that defines the book but then sean himself can't seem to make sense of it so maybe that's appropriate","103":"heavy and excellent","104":"i'm not even sure what just happened i kept waiting for something truly awful to happen but then realized it already did maybe or maybe not truly a surreal experience i felt like i was transported back in time to the 70s 80s like i was living the story as it happened cringing just an amazing novel","105":" there need to be more books about games and game designers and this was a good example about a person who because of a disfiguring event in his late teens created and inhabited the world of a play by mail adventure game to interact with the world outside while trying to understand the darkest parts of his own psyche dark brooding psychological the book leaves you thirsting for the same answers that the protagonist can't seem to find himself it was also a fun albeit disturbing nostalgic trip back into the late 70s early 80s america of cassette tapes denim jackets omni magazine shag carpeting late night television test patterns mail order catalogs and role playing games","106":"french in the sense that there is not much closure or explanation things happen","107":"this was interesting but even after book club last night i'm still not sure how much i liked it it's a very short novel and it left me wanting more the story is told in reverse and culminates with the action that disfigures the main character's face there were two story arcs that i wanted to see more of and i think there was certainly room to flesh out one or two more characters ultimately an interesting read and given the short length i think worth it even after such a middling review","108":"not as much a plot based tale as an utterly fantastic character study sean phillips will linger long after this little book ends","109":"unsettling and thought provoking","110":" john darnielle's first novel has enough elements to keep mountain goats fans on the line the kick in the guts lyrical symbolism is there the protagonist's innocently lonely asides will sneak up on your heartstrings and snap them i read sean as a tragic alternative to the protagonist in the best ever death metal band in denton some alternate universe where cyrus never finds his jeff at first i was a little unsatisfied with the wrap up but after walking away i've made my peace with it you're not meant to reach the trace","111":"i love the premise of this book a guy creates a role playing game type of thing and two players get overly immersed in it lawsuit follows as do questions about accountability etc i think that would be a really interesting book unfortunately that is all barely touched on and resolved halfway through and almost not even mentioned again i don't know how a book so short manages to be so meandering and dull but here we are","112":" initially take by the name of the novel i thought i'd investigate this book a little more i can see why people give it 3 stars or 2 stars much like indie cinema not everything is for everyone i found the story great as sean battles with the aftermath of a suicide attempt which we learn in the closing pages was also going to be much more sinister the story was emotional and connecting you learn the story from various time jumps sean is a saddened figure and it's his families story that hits this story home i honestly felt like i was watching an indie film this is something that always finds its way to me a simplistic story with depth and a real internal struggle at the core i know i'm not alone with my love for this book it's just one of those books you either really like or you really hate i'm obviously on the later","113":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here it was interesting but i kept thinking it would be explained why he decided to shoot himself and why the 2 players decided to play in real life i finished the book just as confused as i was in the beginning the cover art was fascinating and the concept of the book was very interesting i just wanted more","114":" i rang in the new year with the book while searching overdrive for something to read on my phone i noticed the author immediately and thought hey that's the guy from the mountain goats now i'll stop here to let you know i'm not some crazy name dropping hipster who listens to this band on a regular basis i have a general familiarity with them and really like some of their songs do yourself a favor and look up going to georgia on youtube or itunes or something that song is amazing something a little more palatable might be this year if you want to try that one ok now i sound like a crazy name dropping hipster anyway i read the synopsis and jumped in and man i really liked this book a lot it's not about the game the kid creates it's not even really about his deformity it's deeper than that and it spends more time in other places it's just simply a great well written novel i was skeptical in the beginning i honestly had to adjust to the writing a little bit mundane items or actions were described so beautifully i had to slow down and take everything in let it roll softly into my brain and settle in for a little while before i could keep reading it's very unique in the way it's presented and i really enjoyed most of the similes and metaphors that dominated the pages i just wish it could have been a little longer and took more time in wrapping things up it ended and i didn't want it to yet i felt a little empty inside figuratively and literally because i finished the book after skipping lunch","115":" i don't usually write reviews but the negative reviews of this work have lead me to at least try and add a warning label a little signpost that will let you know to turn back if this is not the book for you this book is not first of all an adventure novel like ready player one both do feature nerdy protagonists and the fictional worlds important to them but this is a novel primarily about the workings of the main character's mind as he comes to terms with the tragedy in his own history and the tragedy that falls two players of his game this book is not contra what my above description would indicate a feel good novel where a sick or disabled person learns valuable life lessons and where the point is for the reader to walk away thinking just how durn pretty life is in all of its varieties even in the face of death or destruction it is not the fault in our stars it is not however a novel of despair or nihilism as the great majority of positive reviews would indicate it fits nicely into the typical mountain goats attitude of joy in response to darkness or else there is a kind of o'connor grace in the midst of tragedy and violence even if the grace is not of the supernatural kind it is a hard thing to walk away from this novel feeling anything other than deep sorrow but as can be seen if one does not lose oneself in the last chapter but remembers sean as he is at the later chronological points it is still a thing expected of us this book is not some kind of morality play where we get to learn what the protagonist's mistakes were and what we should do instead this book is not about hanging out with a hip sassy misunderstood relatable dude if you are looking for anything at all like the above just don't bother there are great books that satisfy those kinds of needs out there and i named two of them but this isn't one of them it's a novel about isolation and suffering about violence and power about grace and destruction creation and temptation and about one individual who is surrounded by all of those things it is not about telling a straightforward story but working through a series of bits of story back to the decisive moment that lies at the center of someone's life it's also often simply about sitting down and listening to john darnielle's beautiful prose often gorgeous not so much for the imagery or complexity but for its simplicity and its strange musical cadences","116":"weird tremendously weird and deep but it brings you into the weirdness and it feels comfortable it makes sense and you are at home i am excited to read this book a second time i think there will be surprises","117":"exactly the sort of book i'd expected from the mountain goats which is to say i guess that john darnielle has a way with words the plot was dark with the ache of empathy and the undercurrent of violence i was confused but addicted to the way the story filled my head it was weird the characters weren't particularly likeable and the story wasn't particularly linear but the prose was lovely","118":"this book should be read in high schools in america from coast to coast instead of the great gatsby","119":"i shouldn't have tried to read this book during the end of semester rush it may be much better than i thought bad timing on my part","120":"read this book read this book","121":"i wasn't sure what my expectations of this book should be but it was wonderful some of the plot specifics were sort of unbelievable but every other thing about this book was great in particular in terms of the mental state of the main character and the unraveling of his past it seemed almost like that long ago decision had made the rest of his life calm in a weird way and i liked the manual methodical nature of the role playing game he made up like he's the cogs in the computer or doing the algorithm instead of in binary code in filing cabinets on scraps of paper super good","122":"holy shit","123":"a remarkable first novel from the leader of the mountain goats darnielle's lyricism and strong control of language has always been apparent through his songs but comes into the clear even more through this novel which has a sharp clear consistent voice that really has fangs this is impressive coming from an author unpracticed in the long narrative form throughout the book jd shows a strong understanding of the deep terrifying mysteries of the world and he lets them breathe as they are with no need to explain them away each chapter unpacks a little part of the mystery and maintains a powerful sense of intrigue throughout despite being a novel with relatively little action taking place in the real world everything rather retreating inwards toward itself towards that edifice out in the middle of america somewhere trace italian the safe haven that one can never reach in time to survive","124":"i can't express how much i loved this book i've already started to re read it in fact the lyrical writing the format in which the story unfolds everything is so perfectly done each story memory antidote helps construct the world in sean's head the perspective in which he sees life so while some things may seem random and unimportant to the reader the fender bender he witnesses for example those moments he takes note of define him i think people might be tempted to compare if to invisible monsters but aside from the accident both protagonists have monsters tho a book i loved when i first read it and still holds a special place in my heart can't hold a candle to the subtle crafting of wolf","125":"a great sad book","126":"what i just finished this and am a bit piqued at the ending only because it happened nooooo","127":"i'm normally more of a fantasy reader but when i heard about this book i was intrigued a novel about a guy dealing with a trauma buy building a fantasy play by mail game written by the guy from the mountain goats the novel is more about personal growth and using fantasy as a mechanism beautiful and haunting and poetic","128":"in his teenage years sean phillips was involved in a traumatic incident which left him severely disfigured during his arduous recovery period he invented an incredibly detailed post apocalyptic world as a way of escape now a grown man he has developed this universe into an adventure game called trace italian where players mail him their moves and he in turn sends back the next part of their story but when a young couple start to take his creation a little too seriously sean is forced to face up to the terrible consequences and confront his own difficult past this is quite an original tale i can't say i've read anything like it before the timeline is elliptical we know something shocking has happened to sean from the very beginning but we don't find out the particulars until the very end this approach certainly kept me reading in between the prose is dark and raw the workings of a troubled mind are laid bare to devastating effect it is a meditation on the power of imagination as a means of survival wolf in white van is a beguiling melancholic novel about loneliness guilt and the hidden dangers of fantasy","129":"not cohesive felt like i was reading one long drug trip had to force myself to finish no characters are worth rooting for would not recommend to people sorry","130":"review to come","131":"upon finishing wolf in white van i spent a good hour reading reviews what were they seeing that i couldn't that was back in august now weeks later i've gone back and looked at those reviews again the glowing praise the life changing commentary still i'm not getting it and that more than anything is what frustrates me even when i don't like a book i can still see the other side understand just what its fans find so appealing that's not the case here wolf in white van is barely over 200 pages that still managed to take a few days to read i hate to say it but i think i'll be sticking with darnielle's songs rather than any upcoming novels i will say though that the cover is simply stunning the title is a metallic foil and when the sun hits it just so gorgeous for the full review and more head over to the pretty good gatsby","132":"dim u0026amp twisty familiar themes unfolding into my heart in a different way","133":"this book was very well written but there was something about it that i just didn't love i think that perhaps i would have liked it more if i hadn't read station eleven directly before it which was my favorite book of the year","134":"easily the best book i've read this year","135":"oh my god what a horrible horrible drag","136":"i was not intrigued this book is like waiting in a long line at a restaurant everyone raves about only to be served the epicurean equivalent of a happy meal you will read a lot of details a lot about how to run a mail in rpg you will learn a lot about the one the character made up the entire book is more about the game and what influences the character to make it i'm not one to start going into the humanistic psychological and literary genius of it or how fantastic the prose is bs some of these reviews are ridiculous the character has a traumatic event in his late teens that destroys half of his face he lives in seclusion by being a mail in dungeon master he goes through his memories outlining exactly the type of kid you expect to be a dungeon master even without a tragedy in their lives there are familiar influences like frank frazetta type illustrations on fantasy books and magazines rock album art etc he has a dark memory from one late night early morning watching a televangelist show in the 80's back when they used to think playing records backwards conveyed satanic messages to kids on the show they play a record backwards that says wolf in white van but no one knows what it means ever then it is never discussed in the book again and ties into nothing the entire book is like that a lot of seemingly slow build up events that seem like something is about to start going but darnielle intentionally lets each one deadpan the result is that he never really ends up with a story he fills a lot of lines with details that mean nothing to the story you wade through them thinking they'll be significant later they will not be i don't care about the little suicide pov or the humanity of it all this book ultimately wasted my time there is no zenith no apex no climax the end of the book is merely a very descriptive pov of the one moment in the character's life where darnielle brutishly corrals the reader into wondering about what twist he's going to put at the end to make it interesting the answer is none nothing he's mostly already described in bits and pieces throughout the book what happened this is worse than stephen king this is worse than the blair witch but there were those who loved those stories some people liked picaso i call bs","137":"one part the flip side of ready player one and one part jim the boy","138":"you know how sometimes you go out to dinner and your overall meal is pretty bad but there was one part the appetizer perhaps the bread that was very good so you can't completely write off the experience that's wolf in white van for me there were entertaining pieces but my overall take was i was thrilled when it was over thankfully it's only 200 pages still a waste of my time","139":"lyrical and beautiful every word carefully chosen","140":" sitting here hemming and hawing over the correct number of stars for this novel the four stars are for the many sections of the book that i found beautiful or relatable the connection the main character makes to both fictional worlds and to role playing games as a way to escape from and or cope with a frustrating real world for example on the other hand i nearly gave it three stars for either being too short to really do what it seemed to be trying to do or for spending too much time on aspects of the story that never panned out so four stars it is i guess four stars for the parts of this book that made me wish it was longer","141":"rating 3 5 5 0 rounded down","142":"all stillness amplified to a tritone hum i contemplated my mission there right on the threshold but all honor had gone missing from it too many threads came loose and couldn't be drawn back in and so i thought about what was important to me about how i would want to be remembered about the totality of my vision realizing itself now under the heavy pressure of the moment but remaining true still true to the impermeable solitude of its origin","143":"the problem with this book is summed up in the title it is a pretty sounding phrase with a tentative meaning only tangentially alluded to in the plot with the result that the reader has a sneaky feeling that the author chose it simply because it is rather baffling this is well written even over written at times - particularly the end which should have been the emotional crescendo of this origami like tale but instead we get this and so i thought about what was important to me about how i would want to be remembered about the totality of my vision realising itself now under the heavy pressure of the moment but remaining true still true to the impermeable solitude of its origins sean is a pretty unlikeable character to the extent where i found it difficult to sympathise with him the people i felt most sorry for in this sorry tale were his parents i am sure readers of different ages will have different reactions while this book frustrated me it also left me feeling uncomfortable and weirded out which i suspect is a conscious strategy of the author to signpost the general incomprehensibility of life and people particularly those alien creatures known as adolescents who knows why anyone does anything having said that all the clues the swords the musing on conan as some kind of a sage points to the fact that sean simply and desperately emulates the death of robert e howard his hero thus trace italian becomes a homage to the hyborian age this is so depressing though that the reader does not want to believe such a prosaic and devastating conclusion which i suspect is why other reviewers have attached words like 'transcendent' to this book but for me that fetishises suicide i know nothing about the mountain goats and so came to this book cold which left me cold and feeling rather soiled by this reading experience which is eye wateringly bleak being forced to sift the clues about sean's fate from the fragmented narrative i felt strangely implicated in keeping him alive somehow but at the same time harbouring this relentless curiosity about his downfall it is a difficult balance to maintain particularly in such a relatively short book this makes for grim but compelling reading but at the end i do not think it coheres sufficiently to become something more than the sum of its parts like the pieces of sean's face like all the envelopes containing all the clues of the trace italian","144":"i could not finish this book because i simply didn't care for the story or the protagonist that normally means 1 star but the writing was quite beautiful at times and therefore it somewhat deserves an extra star for that also it's my fault i'm not finishing this because i should've known that i won't enjoy the story","145":"like peeling back an onion each turn of the page reveals a newer softer inner but it's still an onion stings at times makes you cry at others the story haunts you long after you finish the book","146":"at the beginning it felt like 5 stars the right combo of intriguing and thoughtful towards the middle i took a break and when i came back and read part 2 it didn't feel as affecting it was still an excellent book and for that it gets 4 stars","147":"first half was really great second part was fine but not as good","148":" forget the synopsis it fails the heart of the writing instead of marveling at the writers impressive technical skill the character and story arch are truly impressive i find his ability to show that the deep ubiquitous shadows of the main character's life both internal and external are cast by an surprising inner light and lightness an unexpected will to appreciate what little life offers to survive and even thrive through an acknowledgment and acceptance of the incoherence of existence although after the first chapter or so i was unconvinced i would want to finish something about what appears a troubled grotesque character i find this read one of the most intriguing and strangely life affirming modern stories i've read as another reviewer said finishing the book left me in a thoughtful reflective pause contemplating reading it again for now i choose to savor and reflect on the experience","149":"wolf in white van was initially interesting but i lost interest as the story continued and i stopped listening to the audiobook","150":" like just about everyone else i've always loved john darnielle's lyrics but i have never been able to get excited about the mountain goats whose instrumentals and melodies always strike me as interchangeable afterthoughts just an excuse to get the words down on tape so for a long time i've hoped that darnielle would write a novel and now that he has i'm thrilled that it's about a million times better than i even expected it to be i read the last paragraph then read it again and wanted to turn back to the first page and read the whole thing from the beginning i can't remember the last time a novel made me feel that way","151":"john darnielle's band the mountain goats is one of my favorites and i'm a huge fan of his social media posts thus i was hoping expecting this would be a five star book the writing is excellent and it's an interesting story but what started out very strong tapered off and left me feeling incredibly unsatisfied","152":" i have been a big fan of the author's work in the band the mountain goats for years he has a unique voice and a way to turn even the mundane into an engrossing story i was not disappointed in his first novel one thing mr darnielle does is takes things that many people would consider to be minor detail and be able to make you wonder about it dwell on it sometimes to distraction in some of his songs it may be the hint of remembering an important event like a train headed south out of bangkok down towards the water without ever telling us what happened there how was that so titular to a relationship that is now broken yet so important that the subject and his lost love remind each other about it within this book we get a glimpse into the life of a young man forever damaged by an accident which changes his life and leads him to create a snail mail based adventure game through his skill in oblique story telling we get to work our way through what happened to this young man exactly is there really a point to this game the lives of some of the people who still play a snail mail based game and how it impacts their lives this isn't a book about high adventure this is darker more introspective and for all of it's rich text a very ambiguous book i loved it as i love his other works and i hope he writes more","153":"as a fan of darnielle's music and his other book for the 33 and 1 3 series i fully expected to enjoy what would unfold in this story to be honest it's interesting enough and in fact i burned through the first 100 or so pages that being said once the intricacies of the character's games were traded for self actualization the story grew a bit weaker and my interest waned so first 100 pages gets 4 stars last half of the book gets 2 a good read for sure but a great read eh","154":"this intriguing little novel which starts at the end and goes to the beginning touches you in so many ways how a young man reshapes his life after a catastrophic injury by inventing a game that is played through the mail fascinating story","155":" it is a dirty feeling having to quit a book in fact it has only happened in my life once before and yet here i am again this time relinquishing john darnielle's wolf in white van to the to be donated pile alongside my library of keepers what's most disappointing about this reading experience is that i'm a huge fan of darnielle's music the about the author page of the book praises him as one of the best lyricists of his generation and i whole heartedly agree his terse lyrics are honest in way that would make hemingway proud we care about the stories he tells through his music because his lyrics are stripped of artifice as a result we can see the narrative more clearly yet this isn't the case in wolf in white van in fact his sophmore effort feels sophmoric darnielle relies on gimmicky plot tricks to keep us reading such as not revealing fully what happened to the protagonist's face while this works for the first fifty or so pages darnielle keeps at this strategy with his other subplots all of which result in a frustrated reader who cares nothing about the characters involved moreover darnielle's tight lyricism is completely lost in the novel instead the reader gets the sense the author is trying to prove his literary chops by piling on literary devices take for example this passage whatever it was past or present or unknown future it seemed to rise from the asphalt like a little invisible cyclone swirling up around me in my mind i felt like a panel in a comic book 72 the beauty of darnielle's lyrics is how their simplicity allows the complexity of the characters and their stories to shine through here his narration is unnecessarily dense and we are left with a lot of words and very little takeaway maybe it's hypocritical to review a book i didn't finish but the fact remains that this book was promising only because of the author's musical successes in the end we're reminded that just because you can sculpt doesn't mean you can paint just because you can write a song doesn't mean you can write a novel","156":"a truly dark read as others have said it is unusually short for such a serious topic overall i think it's much easier to connect with this book and the protagonist if you choose to see it as a lyrical essay a non linear exploration rather than a structured narrative while i did find it very interesting i am left with many questions","157":"a beautifully written story i could get lost in the words a painful topic addressed respectfully not maudlin","158":"well that was dark","159":"i respect john darnielle but this book was too dark for me genuinely unnerving","160":"sean is a young man who lives a fairly reclusive life he has been horribly disfigured in an accident and he supports himself by supplementing his insurance payments by hosting a mail order subscription game he is forced to rethink his life when a pair of his game players take his game too seriously with fatal results","161":"i was afraid this would just be a vanity project by one of my favorite songwriters but darnielle is a genuinely talented writer thematically and aesthetically this book is kind of like samuel beckett filtered through flannery o'connor","162":"packed with phrases that belong scrawled on walls and skin john darnielle's talent and the humanity he uses it to depict stun i feel lucky to live in a time when he's creating","163":"i'm not a gamer and i think i would have gotten more out of the book if i was still i appreciated the quiet unfolding the level of description and the careful characterization the randomness of the choice was a powerful thing i'm being vague because i don't want to give anything away a very moving portrait of loneliness and rich inner life","164":"this book was a slowly unfolding look inside one mind disturbing it had moments of brilliance","165":"don't normally even say this word but this book warrants it terrific what darnielle touches turns to word gold","166":"overrated waste of time","167":"well that was interesting","168":"the first half of this book effectively straddles the fine line between cohesive narrative and disjointed head trip it reads similarly to palahnuik but is structured like a music album every chapter feeling like its own vignette only loosely connected to the overarching story yet still effective in contributing to the slow build leading to the unraveling of its mysteries the second half is much more fractured and nonlinear to the point that i was only sporadically entertained and finished the book only for the sake of finishing it and finding out the circumstances behind the protagonist's physical state which dominates the book's tone and premise the ideas are thoughtful relevant and relatable for me but the execution was a bit heavy handed and flawed","169":"abandoned i just don't see what is so exciting about this book i read over half of it and just didn't get it","170":"amazing writing i'll eagerly read anything darnielle puts down but i'm not sure everything about the ending landed for me still had me constantly photographing lines though and is well deserving of its spot on the national book award long list","171":"one of the more disturbing books i've read in a while full of good but sometimes confusing prose muted horror and human suffering the structural choice to have the protagonist narrate his life in reverse leading up to a traumatic suicide attempt was interesting but didn't really pay off the way i wanted it to solid debut by the lead singer of the mountain goats","172":"this book was so strange parts of the story was okay to listen to then others i was like say what","173":"not much to say here i was expecting a fun and thrilling plot my mistake for not reading what the book was about but then i really wasn't sure why i was reading this book i had added it to my library wish list and because it was available and quite a short length i thought to give it a try but i kept thinking why was i reading about a guy named sean who has a very tragic face and a lot of disabilities although i loved author's narration in the audio overall i was kinda bored","174":"totally incapable of coherent thought about this right now except to say that it is haunting and remarkable and wow wow wow it's been a long time since i've been so wrapped up in a book that i had to force myself to put it down to make dinner to shower to actually get off the streetcar at my stop on my way to work one more time wow wow wow","175":"this just didn't work","176":"i feel like giving three stars is too much but at the same time not enough i do not think this is a bad book it just did not live up the potentially very high expectations i had placed upon it due in large part to the national book award long list nod because of which the onus rests on me not wolf in white van i suspect am not the target reader many parts are extremely well written and some passages will stay with me long after i have finished the book i just find this an extremely sad book that may appeal more to a certain type of lonely isolated and more youthful person than myself i have always been social and gregarious i have dealt with loneliness by safety in numbers in friendship and chatter sean the narrator is an outsider on the fringe of most things both before and after the accident an observer with a hyper active imagination i have never felt as hopeless as sean and i wish we as reader had more of a window in his specific issues that caused his actions and reactions that lead to the accident warning this paragraph is spoiler ish though i have read this info in reviews on npr etc so it is out there but just skip it if you want to go into the novel blank i basically read the novel in a day in two sittings on a long bus ride and was much more taken in by invested in the book in the beginning when the accident was shrouded in mystery and you did not know it was just a failed suicide attempt i feel like maybe i am missing something if it was just a failed suicide attempt why did sean not finish himself off later instead of living through all the pain rehab loneliness and gawking at being disfigured did he find himself now special and with purpose post accident physically even beyond the creation of the trace italian game did he have a legit excuse in his own opinion now to alienate himself from society and live inside his own mind and a world of imagination as a female who was never into video games after a brief super mario brothers obsession that ended when i beat the game in the late 80s and never having role playing games i figured that there would be something niche here that i cannot relate to on more than a surface level but i was wrong i see a parallel in this imaginary role playing world where they could pretend to be something different to my elaborate world my barbies played in and where i could escape into a different more glamorous world where i was in charge and who i wanted to be in my confusing teen years the trace italian parts of the novel were my favorite i loved the way the clues were simply written but so descriptive the choose your own adventure ness' of the game and clues the explanation of how sean ran his business and such how he felt he had purpose and his invented world gave him satisfaction and accomplishment even though it was an old fashion via subscription game listed in the backs of magazines delivered by usps mail game it brought people together in a more concrete way then a computer screen and i can understand that the tangible letter paper in hand gives things weight the internet cannot i can see how lance and carrie in kansas two of the most invested subscribers of trace italian found such solace inside the game and got lost inside of the elaborate roll playing search for the trace italian that was an escape from real life but that is where the understanding ends as my mindset and mental state cannot grasp self harm even in my darkest moments too much imagination can be a detriment also for much of the book i was expecting a type of surprise twist at the end like invisible monsters but chuck palahniuk and was more than a bit disappointed when that didn't happen","177":"oh this was terrible i love the mountain goats and i was so excited to read this but john darnielle needs to stick to writing lyrics it is 100% false suspense he never tells us what happened to his face or why nothing is ever resolved regarding the law suit against sean for the death of two people who were playing his mail in game he basically just exists for 200 pages such a disappointment","178":"there wasn't even any actual fucking wolves in this book no thank you","179":"i liked the book but i felt like it was setting up for a huge emotional reveal at the end that i feel like most readers would have already figured out on their own i was disappointed that it didn't go anywhere surprising and i still didn't feel like i knew why what happened happened it's like the book was trying to make a statement and then decided not to i'm not sure i liked the tone of the book a lot and it kept me interested while reading it but i wouldn't go back to this one","180":"disappointing the story had some potential but i didn't enjoy the way it was told anti climactic for the sake of avoiding spoilers i'll leave it there","181":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wow you start kind of from the end and then gradually piece together disparate events over a timeline which jumps about the final scene is striking and shocking yet i still didn't quite understand his motivations but that worked in a way would like to re read","182":"if you like the inventive but sometimes dark and puzzling lyrics of the mountain goats you will probably enjoy wolf in white van","183":" it's really important that you go read this now it's so beautiful for something so strange a mail order science fiction game a disfigured writer wayward teenagers and two generations of confused parents trying to blame the unfathomable choices of their children on some sort of outside evil the narrator is a mystery to himself he doesn't understand why he did he took the most important actions of his life but he's also committed to staying true to his odd interpretation of truth and purpose there's a sweetness to him that runs deep even as he described his alternate life as a rampaging cruel barbarian he's kind of the opposite of the saying that evil is sickness celebrating itself instead he has this thread of unknowable unchangeable difference in him that he stays true to while trying not indulge it or hurt anyone so he constructs a world where every choice matters and every path is individual as it does it the 'real' world even though that's harder to understand and believe","184":"same rating zach kuhn gave catcher in the rye","185":" the book was good in concept nice idea bad book major spoilers aheadif you are going to say a roleplay world caused two teenagers to run off in search of it in the real world that roleplay world better be compelling fascinating and engaging this one ehhh can't imagine anyone running to their death over it this was supposed to go to trial and then whoops nah not really so much for that plot line and we shoot ourselves in the head for no reason wake up a disfigured mess that no one wants to look at and all mental problems if any magically disappear and inner peace reigns supreme so much so that who needs plastic surgery and what does that book title mean ummmm satan remember those days when satan put backwards messages on rock albums well satan put wolf in white van on a record the thought is contemplated at almost exactly the 50% point in the book and then never mentioned again but so worth naming the book for i guess really no clue what this guy was thinking so my best guess at a theme here is apathy you have a really good day get a nice package in the mail and a date with the new girlfriend who lets you in her pants and then you get home and decide that putting a shotgun to your head is better than just going to sleep unless we are going to go with the satan made me do it thing and the bullet coincidentally exorcised the demon within most of the good reviews for this book seem to come from people who like the author as a musician that is just fine but it doesn't make for a good book this is not a good book","186":"i wasn't sure i would make it through this one and yet in the end it comes together and i'm glad i stayed with it the game is fascinating and i would sort of like to try playing it but it also seems dark and endless and futile and i know that is kind of the point right hmph","187":"i'm not sure i would recommend this book to everyone but for those i do i love you this book will haunt me there were moments where i felt grateful to the writer for giving these words to me these moments these thoughts it never felt forced or rushed just honest unflinching and so painfully beautiful","188":"i wanted desperately to like this book as whole i think that the writing is great i think the development of sean as a character is great i just felt like this story went nowhere i wanted to see the story go somewhere and i felt like it was so stagnant i loved the style of writing so much that i feel disappointed","189":" i've had cluster headaches all week so it's been hard to assemble thoughts coherent enough to even begin to comment on this amazingly profound book it is probably the best novel i've read all year i'll go out on a limb and say that i was reminded of swann's way this book is definitely a remembrance of things past and like proust darnielle fully enters the child's perspective and makes that world limited and dull as it is so vivid that you're basically on the edge of your seat part of that is the hook of course first what happened and then how so this is a book that's like sw in craft precision and delight but that also has a lot more narrative drive and it's a kabillion words leaner than sw that's okay this character has lived a lean life normally i don't much like books about alienated dissociated characters but sean as an adult is not as disconnected though he is isolated as it first seems he cares deeply for the players in his game his honesty about and acceptance of his deformation help him connect with random teens and near the end it seems like he may make some changes that will enable him to be more a part of the world most important is the compassion with which he regards his younger self so was the great defining event of sean's life a suicide attempt or an accident sean calls it an accident most of the time if he can even refer to it at all i'm inclined to go with accident what happened was a function of depression and it just kind of happened it's an interesting commentary not only on young suicides but also on young shooters young sean is in a kind of trance his parents are convinced that his obsession with dark fantasy dark music and video games is the reason for what happened even before they were highly concerned unable themselves to connect with what sean was interested in they pushed him deeper into it and they're not exactly wrong about the dangers of the content he's ingesting david whyte i'm not his biggest fan but i agree with this has said there is a type of existential disappointment that children feel when they realize that unbeknownst to them their parents have welcomed them into a world that lacks imagination whyte speaks of the the high rate of teen suicide that occurs when children on the threshold of adulthood realize how little they are being offered how narrow and predictable the world they are given turns out to be sean's parents are particularly unimaginative other kids go on vacations with their families but sean's parents take time off from work and then just stay home and go on drives he's an only child and not well adjusted socially though he does have a group of friends eventually with similar interests in fantasy music and gaming he reads but his parents make no attempt to engage him regarding that and what is he interested in conan the barbarian i didn't know there was a whole world of conan beyond the movies heroism the lord of the rings fantasy retreat into a world full of potency and magic video games again retreat into a world where the rules are clear the results are measurable and it's possible to be a hero this book isn't exactly about hero fantasies among young males and i'm glad of that because i'm really sick of boys men and the whole comic book thing what we're seeing is a retreat from a world that feels empty and meaningless into one that offers magic and mystery sean grows up to create a role playing game and another tragedy certain that's the right term literarily speaking develops out of children's immersion in the fantasy realm this is the occasion for sean to reflect on his own loss of contact with reality as a child so gaming i just heard an interview on npr about an effort to create a vr game around hiv or really about the risks kids take in adolescence studies have shown apparently that when people make good choices in games they tend to make them in their lives as well studies have also shown that participating in violent games can inure people to violence which is why the military uses video games as part of training exercises adding these two sets of studies together the positive and the negative we might by now safely conclude that sean's parents have a point if positive games lead people to make positive choices it could possibly follow that violent games lead people to make violent choices combine that with a desperate desire to be elsewhere to be anywhere but here and a world of violence of coldly wiping out villages from the safety of video game aircraft for instance and a kid who's already depressed perhaps congenitally and of course depression is depression and sean's seems to have been present in his life pretty early on fundamentally the existential blank at the core of his personality is what drives the events of his young life it's so deep so engrained that it might as well be a satanic message embedded in a record that must be played backward like the story we're reading to decipher it and even then it's garbled why would satan want to tell us wolf in white van poetic as that image is but maybe he does want to tell us children of this era forward are taught to fear vans sometimes they're driven by wolves wolves wait in white vans for children and the wolf waiting for sean is his narrowly missed death but of course this is more than just a suicidal moment on sean's part he goes and gets the gun he's thought ahead about how to do this so his parents won't be able to see but so they could see if they were watching just a little connectedness on their part would have changed everything and the sad thing is that i think they want to connect but all along they enable his isolation they give him a tv for instance i've never understood why parents allow their children to have tvs in their room and then complain that the kid doesn't come out of his room a friend had a great internet strategy with her kids she had a jack in the kitchen and there only the kids had laptops but if they wanted to be on the internet they had to be in kitchen's sitting area in the heart of the house she didn't stand over them but it was a whole different feeling of containment in the sense of being held loved than being alone in your room doing whatever you want to at an age where you shouldn't be allowed to do whatever you want to do the parents are so worried about sean they don't want him sitting with his head against the speakers listening to headbanger music but they never get it before or after sean's point though is that there is really no explanation for what happens one minute he's talking to his parents and the next he's hiding the gun he doesn't feel particularly sad or angry because he's totally numb and then on the night he considers killing his parents as well if he had he'd be another of the shooters even then he's not angry or sad just numb just not able to think of much reason why he shouldn't do that though i also thought that as he stands outside their bedroom always closed to him he is making one last attempt giving them a final chance to connect with him and to stop this and if he had killed them in some ways that too might have been a gesture of connection a truly final attempt however he decides against it and perhaps that's saddest of all that he can't figure out why they should all die together or perhaps he divines that he will cause them more pain if he dies or is wounded alone there is the anger that often lurks beneath depression early on a boy in a playground tells sean he does know why he did what he did a five year old knows this and it's probably this comment even more than the child who dies playing sean's game that makes him consider whether he did or didn't i'd say he did or that his reasons or not even his reasons exactly but the reason it happened are accessible to sean now as an adult even if he never says depression or says there was a reason in fact he is adamant that there wasn't one which i am grateful for because in the end he didn't really have the kind of reason you can name the disease had a reason the circumstances were a reason the lack of magic in the world was a reason the meaninglessness of even satan's possible instructions was he did it because there was no reason not to still there's more intent hinted at when sean responds mentally to the man who sold his father the gun the man lectures him on respecting guns and ammo and sean says to himself that he knew more about ammo and guns than anyone not just after but before however we don't see such fascination in the events leading up to the event again sean seems to be in a trance yes he plans it yes he considers killing others in a remote video gamey sort of way it's all true i think he did it and also he didn't the trance carried him along there were a few instances where i was confused about timing in the beginning i had the sense that sean was even younger because of his father carrying him down the hall i thought he was around 12 or 13 at most possibly even younger i sort of think the story might have had even more power if this were the case then it seems he can't walk or do much after the shooting yet he goes to the gunseller's house just a few months after he's released from the hospital seems to be able to ride in a car without throwing up seems to be able to track a conversation and interact to walk into the house etc didn't feel quite right also for some reason i thought he got the tv after his grandmother died but she dies later and no one wants him at the funeral so things haven't changed in his family at all during sean's healing process his parents continue to miss the point i also wasn't sure about his current state it's been years but still he has dressings somewhere on his body dressings that need to be changed but minor details here's the crux of the book sean is 13 and spends the summer on the floor beneath his tv often putting his head as close to the screen as possible late at night when there's nothing but blank snow some lessons you learn gradually and some you learn in a sudden moment like a flash going off in a dark room i sift and rake and dig around in my vivid recollections of sean on the floor in summer and i try to see what secret about young sean i guess that he kind of ends up telling the world nothing makes him tick it just happens all by itself tick tick tick tick tick without any proximal cause with nothing underneath it he is like a jellyfish adrift in a sea throbbing quietly in the warm waves of the surf just off the highway where the dusty white vans roll innocently past the book's last image though rips open sean's numbness searing us with his pain","190":"i was so worried i wouldn't like this but it turned out to be really good the book manages to convey the just for you ness that makes some mountain goats songs great you can also see though how john darnielle feels about this and what he thinks about the musician audience relationship in general in the relationship between sean and the players of the game definitely something i want to read again","191":"i think i liked this book for me the hardest part about this book was reading about a real and crappy universal truth that in life sometimes there is no good reason when terrible things happen and after they happen moving forward has consequences and isn't clean for anyone involved not a long read i finished it in a few hours","192":" a short but powerful book that covers isolation loneliness and our choices this is columbine with a different choice made teen who is outcast in high school hangs with other teens who are also not popular sean phillips narrates his own story in pieces mixing fantasy past and present forcing the reader to piece together his story badly disfigured from what he calls his accident he is a loner gamer who developed his own game that's played by mail his only contact with most people is through the game through this novel you get to experience how it feels to be an outsider in youth and adulthood through the choices one makes the game parallels life in that way","193":"very creative and imaginative with a wealth of issues to think about but just not my cup of tea","194":"unique and well written though i think i -- ultimately -- missed the point of what this story aimed to express","195":" in short i hated this book i found it incredibly boring the only thing that kept me reading until the end was the storyline which actually held some interesting merit however working in a reverse motion the book revealed singular clues about sean's past and the driving pull of the novel as you continue to read and that honestly felt like i was being bribed into finishing the book it was like if i read more i'd be offered another piece of information i found the ending to be a boring finale to a boring book and the writing style seemed too 'full' and unnecessary in parts","196":"i wanted to like this so much more than i did disappointment and despair","197":"only reason i didn't give 5 stars is i wanted more more information more reasons for something that has no reason so compelling","198":"i know john at best he is a distant friend and at worst he is a business acquaintance he has supported my endeavors and helped me start a brewery so i bought the book because john is a great man and john is a great poet and lyricist and i am sitting here at 2 23am crying like a child at this incredible work i am disturbed and i am joyous i am reminded of my own youth and the infinite paths i could trace from that hub john destroyed me and i am very glad he did","199":"dark riveting couldn't put it down insanely unfair that darnielle is this talented at music and fiction writing","200":"this is going to take some serious processing the whole time i was reading this book it was like something was just out of my reach something familiar yet strange i know this place trace italian i know this boy man however this whole world is hazy maze like indistinct i want to understand but i am almost afraid to","201":"not my kind of book depressing although the concept was interesting the book went backwards","202":"i am really in the minority here glowing reviews abound people are left pondering the deep meaning of this book i don't get it the book and the timeline are all over the place i don't get the game choices endless possible outcomes a parallel to life i don't know i'm not sure how to find meaning in what sean does if he doesn't seem to know himself the book is different i will say that i just didn't connect with it my 3 rating has one more star than i'd like to give just because i'm sure i must be missing something important","203":" this was a really good book and i'm still chewing on pieces of it john darnielle has made a bunch of my favorite records as the mountain goats but he also used to write a zine called last plane to jakarta and his twitter and tumblr skills are excellent -- he's really good about approaching new media as they are instead of how the last one was and he's a hell of a storyteller in general so i was pretty excited about this from the get go without the usual \"that singer you like is writing a book\" trepidation anyway he's not writing as the mountain goats here but the m o is familiar sort of do you remember that thing he did with the alpha cycle that spiraling approach where he obliquely walls off possibilities one by one until you're left with only the way things had to go well this isn't that but it sort of smells the same","204":" this may not be the inaugural novel you'd expect from america's best non hip hop lyricist nyt at its surface layer it can be obtuse and inscrutable for anyone who wasn't born in the late 70s or the early 80s the protagonist sean grows up in isolation after a self inflicted gunshot wound disfigures his face making and operating mail in choose your own adventure games for similarly disaffected or disconnected people on the other hand there are layers to the novel and structures beneath its skin sean's story is shared by lance and carrie two youths who in the maturity of sean's first game lose sight of reality and pursue the game into the real world with tragic consequences darnielle steps sean forward through lance u0026amp carrie's story while unwinding sean's past and here we see the lyricist at work verse and refrain sean's gruesome incident is the source of his isolation and loneliness and is the seed for sean's greatest creation his game trace italian trace italian in turn is the vessel from which the tragedy that befalls lance and carrie is poured and to what is this cycle attributed this is subject to reader interpretation generational malaise some would say holden caulfieldesque psychosis others might say one source offered poetically rather than dead pan might be an undercurrent of demonic influence in popular culture sean recalls prior to his incident a late night televangelist program decrying satan's influence in music songs played backwards reveal cryptic but evocative lyrics such as the eponymous wolf in white van this is a tenuous indictment but indeed is it not similar to the important things in sean's fragile world in the final description of his description sean is disconnected from his own will inspired by unknown motivation to use the rifle to some grizzly mischief is it only by the grace of god that he uses it only upon himself rather than his family and trace italian his creation that comes to him during his painful recovery sean attributes to it a kind of self determinism that his later creations do not enjoy in an elegiac way perhaps sean is the unwitting patsy in an eons old game of chess between a silent god and a meddlesome and quarrelsome devil a game in which the moves are unilaterally executed by the antagonist wolf in white van is not a page turner i sponsored this novel for my book club and found that it's exactly the sort of book that is profoundly enriched by the thought and discussion around it if taken at its surface layer only sean proves inaccessible to anyone not in the sweet spot of age demographics i'd recommend this book to the reader searching for something to mull over to mentally return to as a worry stone from time to time","205":" this book was the best kind of stunning it won't connect with everyone it has a target audience lonely outcast angry romantic fatalistic pathetic tragic sardonic geeks not in the i love comic book movies i'm a total geek way the word gets thrown around now i have no problem with those people it's great that you like stuff i like and there's nothing sacred about the word geek but that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about having kill 'em all on the tape player in your parents' basement while your friend's older brother shows you a dungeon master's guide for the first time and you get the feeling that everything about that moment is so perfect and revolutionary that you kind of want to burn the house down i wanted to reread it as soon as i put it down i'll probably wait a few weeks it is definitely something that i will be keeping on my bookshelf and lending out with some frequency i expect most people will return it with an awkward yeah um it was okay but someone i know will feel it the way i felt it and we'll have to stay up all night drinking cheap liquor and talking about the trace italian","206":" i'm about halfway through and so far i don't know what i think on the one hand passages emerge from this book that are evocative and achingly beautiful i know darnielle mainly from his work with the mountain goats and then to a lesser extent his online presence i trust him implicitly in matters of emotion and depression since he's spoken to them so well in other works and some of that talent comes through on the page here some but so far to my mind not enough on the other hand the book feels fragmented incomplete in a way that i want my novels to be complete this is probably to some extent on purpose by darnielle but it doesn't give me much enjoyment i wonder how much the sense of incompleteness has to do with the first person narration being tied so closely to the psyche of the main character or the fact that it doesn't progress uniformly through time but wanders about through the character's life and memories everything is a memory within a memory within a memory i guess maybe my complaint of incompleteness is one i should wager with the human brain rather than the book i will definitely finish it though it is tough going at times due to bleakness of subject matter the tragedy of the teenagers playing his game affects me particularly due to some personal history with the pitfalls of adolescent fantasy worlds and i do like it i just want i don't know more eta i finished it and wow this book completely won me i think it happened as soon as i realized it was a suicide attempt and that completely changed my idea of the character and fleshed him out for me beautiful powerful frighteningly close to home","207":"not sure what i was expecting weird book","208":"he does an amazing job of putting you in a teen's world but i wanted a little more with the ending","209":"i actually think this is the worst book i have read in recent memory i never write reviews but have to vent unrelentingly depressing zero character development or motivation plot that wasn't fleshed out can't wait to dissect in book club file under things julia rappaport hated","210":"what the heck is this","211":"didn't like this nearly enough as i'd hoped given the reviews disappointed in that","212":"i jumped into this book knowing nothing about it heard about it on the reading aloud podcast going in blind made the read extra interesting for me in some ways it felt like a strange sort of mystery story to me i couldn't help speculating about the events leading to the big change in the main character's life the descriptions of the people who played his game his descriptions of the game itself and his interactions with people in his before and after the event life are engrossing and intense i'm going to give it some time but i'd like to read it again","213":"this is one of those books that left me thinking about it every time i put it down it's told in reverse making the end and the climax one in the same dark imaginative sad and beautifully written it always feels weird to say i enjoyed reading a book like this but it grabbed me and held on the whole way through","214":"beautiful haunting prose but i wish i'd known a little bit about how snail mail rpgs work before starting the book i hadn't even known there was ever such a thing","215":"yeah john darnielle is pretty much the coolest person ever i enjoy how he lives out his love of death metal","216":" meditative writing at nearly its finest it does a good job of evoking feelings and impressions that exceed the sum of the text however it ultimately boils down to a story about teenage ennui or angst which leaves me conflicted those feelings are unfamiliar to me personally and as an adult they strike me as immature and hollow yet even so there's no falseness in it if you properly capture teenage stupidity from an internal narrative are you being stupid well no of course not so it must be said that the overall story here is necessarily limited but told well enough more aspects could have been explored though","217":" john darnielle's wolf in white van is quirky and cool tremendously creative and a little bewildering how's that for a reading experience when sean phillips was 17 he suffered a disfiguring injury that left him near death even years later people still stop and stare at him when they see him and he lives an isolated life practically estranged from his parents and apart from periodic errands he sees only his doctors and a visiting nurse who helps care for him while sean was recovering in the hospital he invented a role playing game called trace italian which leads people through a dystopian world full of violence danger and risk played through the mail trace italian and several other games sean invented have allowed him to live independently and exercise his creativity but when two teenagers lance and carrie get a little too involved in the game and bring it into reality sean is forced to account for his game and examine if he in any way encouraged their actions as he reflects upon lance and carrie's decisions sean also examines his life and how he got to this point he explores the impact his injury has had on his everyday existence and his relationships with his family and friends and tries to determine what his future holds i'm not sure why but i guess i was expecting a book along the lines of ernest cline's fantastic ready player one--a first hand look inside of a role playing game and how it affected both those who play and the creator but while wolf in white van does touch on trace italian periodically this is a far more introspective brooding study of a deeply flawed and troubled yet sympathetic character i thought john darnielle told a great story and i really liked sean's character i just found that the book left me with more questions than answers i was hoping for more of an understanding of why sean did what he did i'm being purposely oblique so as not to spoil the way the book unfolds and also wished that the book had gone a little more in depth into his interactions with lance and carrie this is a book that requires a little patience because it takes a while for the story to take hold of you but it's worth it while i think people will have different interpretations of the events in the book there will be little doubt that darnielle is a great writer and i look forward to seeing where his career goes from here","218":" this book is a tough one to rate on the one hand john darnielle is a fantastic writer his writing is evocative and quiet but places you right in the moment reading this is like a fever dream with the moments bleeding into one another until you're not quite sure what's happening well done on the other i could sum up the entirety of what happens in this book in two sentences it's great writing in search of a plot the style of flashbacks and erratic time shifts may work for some but i didn't love it in so short a book i don't need it to be linear but when you reveal the accident halfway through and i've figured it out very early on it loses the power of impact view spoiler also this reminded me of the great gq cover story about richard norris i felt like i learned so much in that story that this book didn't illuminate much even though it was more inspired by the suicide attempt of james vance hide spoiler","219":"every sentence is a gem a bit nihilistic and cold but also beautiful","220":"this would make a good book club selection lots of ideas to unpack and i feel like different people would take different things away from it","221":"this book was a wonderful read john is hilarious","222":"an odd tale of a man thinking back working backwards in his mind the events from his on tragedy to others good but not great often meandering but always interesting","223":" john darnielle is a brilliant song writer and his debut novel proves he's pretty good at longer forms too but wolf in white van is both a fascinating and a frustrating book sean is a young man who suffered a terrible disfiguring accident as a teenager and now lives largely isolated from his family and the world he makes a living by running a complex role playing game called trace italian where players send their moves through the mail and he responds guiding them through a post apocalyptic landscape toward a safe haven that will never be reached when two of sean's players are harmed by taking the game too seriously it forces sean to reflect on his own accident years before the narrative takes place entirely in sean's thoughts as they swirl backwards in time to that moment darnielle does a great job creating the character of sean and he handles the twin storylines and jumbled timeframes expertly the two stories interact with one another and reveal a certain unmeltable darkness inside of sean it's a fascinating uncomfortable and unconventional psychological portrait but unfortunately darnielle doesn't seem to know what to do with the character he's created view spoiler because the book ends with a flashback to sean's attempted suicide we never learn what ultimately happens to him going forward sean remains stuck static unchanging it seems that this is in some sense the point of the book both the book's title and the structure of trace italian seem to indicate that this is a puzzle with no solution a mystery with a blank space in the center but this ultimately feels like a huge cop out after all that has come before it would be a literary miracle to have written a way forward for sean that didn't feel like an after school special but it's a little disappointing that he didn't even try hide spoiler still he's obviously a talented writer and the critical love that the book is getting makes me hopeful that he'll get to keep writing","224":"really intelligently written psychological examination of a very humanely written character lots of interesting ideas about creative minds despite the dark nature of the story and it's characters it shows empathy every step of the way","225":"a very very fast read but the poignancy of the story stays with you this particular kind of adolescent painted by darnielle of the heavy metal listening introvert inclined to hide away in comic books and fantasy games and novels didn't quite describe me personally but it does describe many of my friends and certainly some impulses i shared there aren't a lot of writers in touch with that recent past bit of pre internet american history i actually think i'd go so far as to say the book has a lot in common with catcher in the rye and i don't think that'd be particularly hyperbolic or misplaced the portrait of adolescence is really that vivid also there's a touch of proust and yellow wallpaper in there too if we're really digging one thing though at times it was difficult to tell if darnielle was being an immature writer or his writing was intentionally echoing an immature narrator and darnielle's discipline really was the unraveling of the mystery of the injury it was all just matter of fact exposition but not a cheap reveal or anything like that that took maturity i think i think early on darnielle shows his hand when he's talking about the allegations of devil worship in music played backwards and as the singer is describing how evil inserts itself into the art of the musicians sometimes without them even knowing it that was a nod to what happened to the trace italian and finally spoiler one thing that struck me odd with the book was the utter lack of sexuality how can a book be such an honest reflection by an adolescent male without talking about sex or lack thereof until the end we see that one overwhelming event very well might have been the cause for everything that happens","226":"interesting writing style a little anticlimactic for my taste","227":"you know when you read one of those books that just leaves you silent contemplative and in awe when you've finished it this is one of those books it's dream like melancholic weird definitely a mind fuck and such a brilliant one at that i didn't want it to end i could stay in sean's mind i want to keep knowing this person despite the fact that he doesn't even exist but he'll exist in my mind because he is unforgettable darnielle has written a completely unforgettable book and i am in love with it and the way in which he writes and the way he draws you into his mind it is everything i want in a book and i am so sad it's over although it is one to be read over again which i will more slowly next time though i'm in a daze with this book like i want to say more but i don't even know what to say or how to express it in words","228":" i went into this book with only the most basic knowledge of the plot and i highly recommend everyone do the same i finished the book roughly five minutes ago and haven't fully digested it this is a novel that is written beautifully with not a word used that isn't necessary it's unpretentious and purely well sad i want to immediately re read this book but for some reason i feel like it wouldn't be fair not just yet this is a story that takes time to process i felt a special empathy toward the main character though he is so immensely separate from myself i highly recommend this book however i believe as i stated before that if you have not yet read wolf in white van you should stop reading these reviews immediately and go into this book with no ideas","229":"this is an interesting novel since i am not a fan of fantasy novels i found this book difficult to follow at times the sentence structure does flow well and the writing is understandable i just had a hard time following the time line","230":"when he was seventeen sean suffered a terrible accident that left him grotesquely disfigured while in the hospital he escaped into a post apocalyptic fantasy world which eventually evolved into trace italian an elaborate text based role playing game played through the mail he leads a hermit like existence his main human contact his nurses and the letters he gets from his subscribers two of those subscribers took the game too far though trying to reach trace italian in the real world but finding only tragedy a strange deliberate frustrating novel that meanders freely through time slowly circling closer to the two catastrophes but ultimately leaving more obscure than clarified","231":"i don't know if it's considered its own genre but my favorite books are narrated by crazy people i love watching the pages slip in and out of coherency wolf in white van is the best i've read yet it never should have ended i'm actually looking forward to reading it again and i kinda wanna start right now","232":"so much of this book felt like it was written specifically for me things i've done people i've met john darnielle is very good but the problems with the book really aren't problems with the book i think they are problems with me that this book unfortunately becomes the victim to i wanted to love this book which may have been an unfair burden to place on it i enjoyed the structure of it i really liked the pieces of the trace italian i liked the way sean's story unfolded and i thought the writing was honest and beautiful and very true to what i remember of teenage life i was more than a little frightened by the pieces of myself that i found reflected in sean all of those are good things for a book what i didn't love was the stark and disturbing truth of sean's motives it wasn't sinister it wasn't something that even really felt like a statement it was a kid who had spent years feeling outside who embraced these dark and violent ideas who just decided to do it because he had lost if he'd ever had it emotional connection to the world around him and there lies my really issue with the book the parts of me that i see in sean are absent that one very crucial piece the connection to the rest of the world i'm not saying it's not a valid experience or that people aren't really like sean i know they are but it was too sad of an experience for me to enjoy i appreciate the way that this book took me into that experience and let me see what that must feel like as much as a book can but i like to color my world with a happier brush i don't want all my stories to have a happy or positive ending but if they don't then as a reader i would like some kind of lesson or insight for having gone there i want to feel like i have a better understanding of some part of the world or myself for spending time in such a place i felt like the story basically says there isn't a reason it just happened and that in itself makes me sad this is a very powerful and emotional book lots of great ideas and a well crafted narrative i just wished i enjoyed what it actually had to say more","233":" decidedly more complex than i walked into the book expecting it to be i read this in the middle of a string of twisty surprise laden novels and with the chronological jumps that the story undertakes i led myself to believe that this would fall into that camp but the book is much more a rumination on what it's like to be apart from others and to feel every inch of that distance i think it's a really fascinating study of a character and what makes him tick even if he doesn't always understand it himself really a great surprise from darnielle but someone who can craft the characters he does in song can do it just as well on the page","234":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here without saying too much this book is a fantastic look at creativity isolation and self harm the story reads like a memory backtracking through scenes and slowly bringing into focus for the reader different aspects of the accident john darnielle write more books","235":" while reading wolf in white van i kept waiting for a shocking twist i convinced myself that the narrator was lying to me and kept hinging on tiny things in the book as evidence that i was being lied to i guess the reason i didn't trust him this is because i sort of felt like i was reading a chuck palahniuk book and i haven't even read invisible monsters the one that this is most often compared to minor spoilers below however the similarities are fairly superficial there's no shocking twist that shatters your perception of the whole story yes you are gradually told what happened to the author but the end is simultaneously satisfying and dissatisfying frankly i'm still not sure if my mind was blown or if i was cheated i guess that's a good thing still while the character and story were fascinating in spite of the relative mundaneness i'm glad i read this book but i still feel as if i was denied something i just can't articulate it","236":"this was more of a 3d tapestry or diorama maybe that depicts the history four fifths real and one fifth imaginary dungeons u0026amp dragons style game of a reclusive young man who was disfigured by his own hand than it is a story at least so far i as i understood it everything is happening and connected and you're always searching for the thread that ties it together it's beautifully interior but frustratingly still i listened to it on audible it probably would have been too tiring a hike for my eyes","237":" this book was one of the most epically wonderful things i've read in a long long time i have a whole new appreciation for the mountain goats though i think i already loved them a very healthy or perhaps beyond healthy amount john darnielle is clearly brilliant this book is just so beautifully brilliant so wonderfully thought out the concept and sean's character and the poignant way it captures so much of the human experience that may be the most pretentious statement i've ever written in a review but i don't care because this book deserves it it's amazing go read it right now","238":"this book is a disappointing example of someone's brain vomit there is only one character that is developed to any extent the attempt to unravel the events by working backwards can keep the reader interested but there was not a novel's worth of ideas or thinking in it","239":"read in one sitting i am not too sure what i just read but i know i really liked it","240":"interesting way to tell a story although sometimes i felt like i wasn't smart enough to understand what was happening","241":" this book was amazing it's weird i'll give you that it gives you bits and pieces of the story letting you hear little by little what happened to the main character and how he dealt with his life after you never quite find out why it happened depression or another mental illness seem likely from what you are told but it's never outright stated it just is and what happened just happened and that's it i can't even explain why it was such a good book not a lot even happens and what does is given to you slowly and yet it's never boring and at the end nothing really happens nothing is changed or resolved and yet i was satisfied it felt like a good ending to the story that's probably the most vague review ever lol but i liked it and don't want to spoil anything so there ya go d","242":"really liked this book a story of a young man growing up living largely inside his mind in a southern california land reminiscent of much of darnielle's songwriting i especially loved the inverted structure which bases a pretty interesting story around the question of the narrator's motivation for one act that totally changes his life and leaves the act itself for the very end when the reader knows the narrator well engrossing and unsatisfying in a mostly satisfying way","243":"this is probably one of the most painful books to finish because of the great reviews i plodded through but regret that i did it is horribly boring and confusing wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy","244":" 4 5 starsthis book is fascinating a masterfully crafted story it's a book about choices and decisions the narrator sean phillips creates a by mail game in which players are presented with scenarios and make choices to move forward the plot of the book unfolds largely through flashbacks presented in reverse chronological order so with each chapter we see effects before learning their causes and get closer to learning about the incident which led to sean's severe facial disfigurement and we are presented with the dilemma of who is to blame when a couple of players take sean's game too far the only reason it's not a five star book for me is that i felt there were a couple of places where the book lost momentum just a bit but make no mistake this is a terrific piece of writing","245":"rating 2 5 5the publisher's blurb is far more interesting than the book itself when i read it i pictured something akin to a dismal ready player one a nerdy escapist protagonist and an imagined game world based on the description i thought that the book would largely be about the world of trace italian its effects on its players and its damaged creator what i got instead was a book more akin to to rise again at a decent hour the first person ramblings of a mentally unstable protagonist like to rise this is a character driven novel to the extreme plot is extremely peripheral for all intents and purposes the publisher's blurb is accurate but it's also grossly misleading the focus of this book is not on trace italian or its players it is almost entirely about sean's isolation his thoughts and ultimately but entirely anti climactically his accident the book is well written in a meandering non chronological way but it is not the exciting fast paced plot driven novel you would expect from its description i would have been much happier with this book if it had been more like its blurb you can read my full review here http iknowwhatyoushouldread wordpre","246":" for most of the time i spent reading this book i thought of it as a novel about imagination as the narrator a recluse disfigured by an unnamed accident as a teen reckons with the real world fallout of a role playing game he invented he and we contemplates the nature of imagination darnielle depicts a childhood both haunted and saved by an active imagination i related as i suspect most artists would and maybe most people he engages with the sublime without trying to explain it it's a book against explaining in a way but as the book meanders backward to the aforementioned accident i started to read it as a story about choices paralleling the many paths in the narrator's invented game and how each choice is comprised of a million mini choices and influences the novel is strange and ambitious sometimes existing almost too much in the realm of dream but pulled forward by a pretty damn compelling plot i think the plot is a bit of a red herring i think the book is a treatise about how plot is always a red herring yet also the only thing that tethers us to the world","247":" sometimes i read a book that just makes me sit and stare into space for a while afterward because it was so powerful interesting moving or some other strong emotional ride this was one of those books a la memento the book begins at the end of the story and works its way backward in time for a story that you start out knowing the ending there sure are some interesting twists and unexpected turns in reading other reviews one thing that strikes me is how focused everyone seems to be on the game and two of its players lance and carrie for me that was more of a subplot to the main feature of the story sean the main character and why he makes the choices that he does certainly the game storyline is essential to the novel and it helps to illustrate sean's emotional depths i do feel like the lance and carrie portion gets cut a little short but then it kind of has to because of the way the book is written an excellent storyteller john darnielle has really struck a chord with this book it's packed full of thought provoking circumstances and emotional conundrums i'd recommend it to anyone who loved memento to people interested in books whose characters participate in rpgs and to people who like contemporary mystery","248":"compelling and gripping the book starts out in the present and winds its way into the past for a chilling although not surprising final scene there's so much in this novel of just over 200 pages i wish some things had been explained more it's a book you'll think about long after you close the back cover","249":"i just didn't get this book there wasn't enough of a narrative and nothing was explained enough big disappointment","250":"haunting and mesmerizing still have chills","251":"wonderful fascinating novel told in the first person which totally pulled me in from the first page the writing was spare but completely captured and described the narrator through the course of the story while reading it i was reminded more than once of the story telling style of william browning spencer one of my favorite writers","252":"really wanted to like this more than i did a troubled youth status a play by mail post apocalyptic mmo trace italian the details of this haunting game world and how he came to pour himself into creating it are fascinating but so much else feels hastily sketched and insubstantial including most of the characters and all of the real world plot","253":"not exactly what i expected but good","254":" this is the kind of book that shouldn't have an ending really the author should have created a subscription service where you mail him a posted envelope and he sends you the next chapter the avid readers will get their bottomless fill of the book and it won't have to stop not officially you won't have to let your eyes linger over the final words thinking this is it is it and you feel a sick loneliness and you miss a person you've never met and that doesn't even exist the novel features a hideous character externally that is in real life if i stumbled upon him i would've averted my eyes and tried not to stare but by not staring i would just as well have been staring i would have denied him his identity treated him less like a human and more like a freak an unpleasant smell a flattened skunk on the road that i have to tolerate and pretend that i don't notice and that's all the more gutting that i can feel so damn much for this character through his words knowing full well that in real life i would have cowered i had come through the day no worse off than i had come to it which as i had been telling myself for many years now is a victory whether it feels like one or not what i certainly wouldn't have understood is that simply walking into a crowd is an act of heroism to subject oneself to the gawking faces of the crowd and to make oneself a freakshow while just trying to get to the store takes a kind of bravery that i will never know i may end up doing brave things with my life and i may do things that take courage but nothing like that it's an entirely different kind this was steve's exact phrase 'more normal' 'it's freakier before you see it up close ' it's like tire tread it's like a shag rug it's like rope burn scars it's like a badly paved road it's like bent wheel spokes pressed into taffy i told him the truth that i didn't know that i didn't know anymore if i wanted to be 'more normal' or not i had stopped being normal so early that it was hard to imagine being any other way than how i was it seems insane that we would want someone to be normal when they clearly are not and when they clearly have no choice in what's arbitrarily dictated as normal it's strange and beneath you and you would never be that knuckle dragging backwards bigot until you live it and you feel it in your gut when you see him and you realize that you're a part of the problem while at the same time you suffer at its behalf you are both the perpetrator and victim to the hatred of deviance and the more the story's told the more it breaks your heart because of this fact thankfully you don't have to confront this hypocrisy when you only have his words and your mind can invent a much more palatable image of his face you won't have to confront it until they adapt it into a movie and they cast someone far too attractive for the role but read this book if only for the hurt that soaks every page and for darnielle's cynical observations of life that are too beautiful to be someone's debut novel it won't take long because this book is far too short and like a great story should leaves you wanting more","255":"2 5 stars this book had all the makings of a great novel great writing intriguing concept compelling story but it just didn't come together this review says it better than i ever could","256":"can anyone read this book and not be a little interested in the trace italian only three stars though because i wanted more so many of the plot points felt unfinished and not in an artfully done way","257":"hb k a book best read by those who would like a look at our entitled youth and how the parents and teachers forgot that kids need 'mentors'","258":"i'm going to copy what one reviewer already said it's not so much that i loved this book it's more like it burrowed into my brain and stayed there for awhile and i have a feeling it'll stay for some time don't get me wrong this is a dark slow meditative book with more inner dialogue than plot not normally what i would rate 4 stars but it is also completely open and honest while somehow still being so so mysterious it's like a car crash that you slow down for and can't take your eyes off of as you creep past it the narrator is a troubled fractured person living in the aftermath of a self inflicted gunshot wound to the face yet he's compelling relatable and ultimately human i can recommend this book much easier than i can explain it","259":"not a book that fits the star rating system well it's very quiet and needs to be read with attention to tone and not necessarily plot the writing is less outwardly raw which i expected with darnielle because the narrator is living an unusual life but it definitely hits visceral moments that are just what you want from it also just a very cool idea for a book clan tatie runs a mail subscription game","260":" this is one of the most intense books i have ever read i really appreciate the way the author created a splintered story writing style that reflects the shattered face of the protagonist however something about it just didn't connect with me on a certain necessary level sadly i couldn't get as invested as i wanted to that does not change that fact that the book was heavy and the author's exploration of sean's present and past the workings of his mind were fantastically done i think this really hits it's mark in one major way the why of things all we ever want as survivors or outsiders or witnesses is to know that why behind people's actions and really there may not be one even the person themselves could not say why as sean cannot here and i think that speaks volumes the explanation we always seek may not just be hidden it may not be anywhere at all this is demonstrated again with the side story of carrie and lance their decision to make trace italian real and the disastrous results why they did that that answer the parents are looking for the reason sean is called to court it may not exist and that more than anything it what makes this book so special so piercing i really do recommend this book highly it deeply and truthfully explores a subject that i think many people would benefit from experiencing but it is not an easy read so i caution future readers as well","261":"i struggled with my rating for this book on the one hand the prose was really really great i enjoyed individual lines immensely and my copy is full of highlighted passages the plot however left me ultimately unsatisfied as did the character development this makes sense considering darnielle is primarily a songwriter the book seems almost lyrical at times which i enjoyed but it ended up being full of the kind of holes and anti climaxes that kind of kill the mood for me","262":"i liked this book glad i read it but didn't love it felt it was an interesting premise but felt like it didn't sink the landing","263":"this book is interesting it attempts to tackle the question of how to make sense of something that goes terribly wrong when there's no real answer by melding imagination story telling and even glimpses of string theory darnielle navigates a labyrinth of uncertainty where truth is constantly questioned reality is always distant and the world outside seems just out of reach it truly is a tale of a male protagonist wafting through the synapses and nodal points of a world where the web that connects us all seems frail easy to break at any moment and perhaps ultimately unable to support us all if you can read this book and come away not feeling the utter isolation of the human condition you have some gift but certainly there are some shining moments cracks in the exterior where relationships or acquaintances break through to give a glimpse of what life could be if the fundamental principle weren't disassociation seclusion and and the dreadful slow crawl towards disintegration so perhaps there is some hope here though it's rare and hard to find and ultimately is hope worth it or is it just a lie we tell ourselves to struggle on and avoid the reality presented here that we are all outside with no way in and no one to help us through","264":" this book was the first i can recall reading perhaps ever that posed quite a conundrum i enjoyed the book and really wanted to get to the conclusion but i didn't understand what was happening probably 85% of the time i felt sympathy for the main character and have enough of a gaming background to understand the idea of the trace italian game but overall couldn't determine how the various connections were being played out what did several of the secondary characters have to do with the story even the conclusion left me with no feeling of resolution i'm anxious to read the reviews of others now in hopes of shedding some light on my confusion i think i would recommend this book to certain friends but only to have someone else to decipher the riddle of storytelling with","265":" wolf in white van didn't always make sense to me but everything felt pretty maybe pretty is the wrong word but it always sounded right to me like the voice had a lyrical aspect the language wasn't flowery but it was poetic always enjoyable and never dull i also really liked the organization it was kind of all over the place and read like little vignettes of sean's isolated life with only a faint outline of a timeline i really love this sort of structure and the fact that the story ended where in some respects it began was just amazing wolf in white van was very cerebral and slow i highly recommend it unless you're looking for a very action packed read","266":" this entire book was sad with the exception of some beautiful moments where the disfigured narrator feels content with his circumstances but to me this was the saddest passage in the book i looked back at mom and i tried to think of a way to explain to her that i understood that she was concerned for her son hoping to do right by her son but the picture she had of her son wasn't anyone still walking the earth that was someone who had been destroyed his life had been real once and had value and meant something but all that was gone now remade in shapes and forms she hadn't come to understand just yet 'it's ok mom ' i said 'i worry that you'll be lonely ' she said she was crying 'i was going to be lonely anyway ' i said which i didn't mean to come out the way it did but it did and besides it was true as the reader you don't fully understand why sean did to himself what he did and even by the end you don't understand completely but writing about someone who has never been really engulfed in his own reality there was really no other way this book would have worked had it not ended with an unclear resolution this is a beautiful read guys i recommend","267":"this haunting story is about a broken person dealing with his disability and disfigurement after a terrible accident he struggles with introversion isolation imagination and coping it's written in a haunting tone and is a little fractured in terms of timeline but i think that adds to the overall effect of the book i had a lot of feels while reading this book i thought it was very good","268":"this one is hard to pin down it doesn't follow a clear line of narrative there are flashbacks flashforwards and information blips throughout i guess the writing gives the reader a sense of the character's small brain malfunctions due to a terrible accident that is finally revealed in the end it's very hard to tell exactly what is going on but from what i can gather sean the main character writes a subscription payer play by mail text based rpg set in a post apocalypse midwest u s this game is how sean makes money after his accident that left him horribly disfigured and physically handicapped the arcing narrative tells a story of how sean is being sued by the parents of a young couple who played the game but acted out all of the moves they made in real life the couple eventually did something stupid that got them killed it had a very dark dungeons feel to it if you know what i mean at the same time the story moves back and forth between this court battle and sean's memories of how his own parents tried to reconstruct and find answers for sean's accident trying to decide who to sue and how to get the insurance companies to pay for sean's recovery it's also important to note that this story takes place in the early 1980's","269":"different but interesting","270":"this was a strange little book not what i typically go for and i'm not entirely sure that i even liked it but it was the first new book i finished in months for some reason i just haven't been able to get into any books lately a fact that has been terrifying me yet this book without remarkable characters without a linear story or much action grabbed my attention for the day it took me to race through it it's one of those books where i question whether i even get it and that may be the point that we don't get it that there is no reason at the end of the day i think what i enjoyed was the unique structure of the book it starts at the end and finishes at the beginning it's probably the type of book that is only truly appreciated on a re read but not the type of book i would ever re read","271":" damn this was a crazy ass book in a very good way i love darnielle and his lyrics and his turn for language was impressively worked into a complex suspenseful and morally terrifying read an honest but distracted both aware and unaware narrator who is both self destructive and yet able to empathize leads to a meditation on both evil and lack of purpose and their random constant presence in life terrifying and yet strangely hopeful in that the narrator has been given a chance to move beyond that envelopment of confusion into something that could include him in the greater world of others whether or not he does make that choice wow will be thinking about this short quick deep read for a long time i loved working it all out through sean's memories and game too need to talk through this one perhaps","272":"cool dark novel of adolescence and role playing from the lead singer songwriter guitarist of literate indie kings the mountain goats i bet colin meloy wish he wrote this","273":" if i am being perfectly honest i was slightly disappointed by this book while it was still an enjoyable read i liked the book cover and the reviews i had read online so much that i had very large expectations for this novel perhaps my expectations were unfairly high while the book has a good topic how imagination helps us survive and how this same imagination can become all consuming and take over our lives i found it hard to feel any connection to the main character sean found myself wanting more from this rather short novel thought that the author was trying too hard to make his writing artistic at times and found myself not completely satisfied when i finished reading this 207 page novel i would have probably given this book 2 stars but the title and the beautiful cover design merited a third star","274":"wow i want to write a real review but i've got to go to work hopefully i'll get back to it","275":" i didn't really know what to expect from this at all but i was drawn in right away and felt a surprisingly strong connection to this guy i can't say how universal this would be but for me this was one of those somewhat rare books where i felt like i could relate to the central character in more than the most basic of ways not just a wow i like ice cream too kind of thing i was also impressed with the writing or maybe more so the storytelling would be a better word while there weren't necessarily passages that i mentally marked for their beauty i felt like the sort of complex interweaving of elements of reality against fantasy against metaphor against personal history worked really well and was handled with remarkable craftsmanship thinking more about it maybe i shouldn't have expected anything less really good stuff","276":"first of all i've listened to the audio book and don't think it was a wise decision darnielle is reading himself and he really doesn't do a good job it's very montone and for me hard to follow but also i couldn't get interested in the character and the story at all the time jumps were highly irritating and as i always say i like good stories being told without any literary tricks like hinting to things and actually in this case partly never really getting around to explaining them","277":"wolf in white van is the first true novel of john darnielle the magnificent singer songwriter who goes by the monicker the mountain goats anyone who listens to tmg knows that john darnielle is a master wordsmith wiwv is about sean phillips who underwent a gruesome face altering accident or incident at the beginning of the novel we are told that his face was disfigured in the incident but we are not told what the incident is until the end of the novel sean's disfigurement colors how sees hears and experiences the world around him sean becomes a palahniuk esque loner while recovering he creates a game called trace italian sean creates an entire post apocalyptic america where players are trying to get to a safe haven the trace italian in kansas players write in to sean and he tells them their next step reality and the game begin to blend for sean does the art follow reality or does the reality follow art semi spoilers below the title wiwv comes from a tbn show that sean watches evangelists claim that rock n roll is the devil's music and the dark lord's messages are hidden in the music the evangelist plays one album backwards and it says wolf in white van sean thinks this is ludicrous even if there was a devil why would he hide his messages isn't too much work the narrative style of wiwv is like the back tracked record darnielle winds the story backwards as the story progresses so does that make darnielle the devil","278":" this is a thoughtful and wonderful read that surprised me it follows sean phillips who is disfigured from an accident and how he copes with his deformities and lack of human connection sean is also embroiled in a court case where two subscribers to his mail in game trace italian get in trouble after they take the game too far the story jumps around as sean goes between the fantasy of trace italian and other media he consumes to reality the story moves backwards and goes deeper where you find out more and more about the case and what happened in sean's accident it's not as hard to follow as other narratives where the protagonist has a traumatic brain injury or mental illness the sound and the fury comes to mind it was easy to follow and interesting i wanted to know what happened both in the court case and his injury i cared about sean as a character and wanted to see him happy i really connected to themes of participating in game play and fantasy worlds of books and movies and how you must not let them consume you as a member of the youtube community and an avid reader i connected to this theme immensely the novel is short and i do think it could've been a little longer i felt the end was underdeveloped and ambiguous i'm not sure if i liked the feeling i got when it ended but i did think about it throughout the rest of my workday if you have read such books as ready player one or you enjoy fantasy or sci fi this might be a good literary fiction pick for you i recommend it although the jumping around may not be for everyone i dug it though","279":"a disturbing perversely empathetic and could you expect anything else from j darnielle lyrical view of the life of a creative outcast living life on his own terms this slow burn of a novel reveals a family's past present and future through the lens of one the best unreliable narrators i've read in recent memory an unforgettable voice scenes will stick with you for weeks","280":"his grasp on language is spectacular imagery is out of this world really enjoyed this a hell of a lot more than i thought then the ending threw me a little bit but not so bad that it killed the entire book highly recommend","281":"another bleak book felt a bit inevitable at times","282":" wolf in white van has received excellent advance reviews and now has been longlisted for the national book award i knew nothing about the book and its author before picking it up i only read it because of the title and the nba nomination the latter is a particular surprise considering that it's a debut novel and that the author is more widely known for being a musician and leading an indie band the book introduces sean philips who at the age of 17 suffered a serious accident one which has left him permanently disfigured and turned him into a recluse who has retreated into the world of fantasy but during his recovery sean has invented a role playing game which he called trace italian which became his source of income trace italian is an rpg which is played through snail mail and where players journey through a post apocalyptic wasteland each player picks a move from the list of options and sends it to sean who in turn develops the story for them and sends a letter back with new moves to choose everything is going fine until two high school students from florida lance and corinne turn the game into real life and sean is called to personally account for it i can't help but scratch my head at all the good ratings i found the book to be tremendously boring and only finished it out of obligation its short length also helped but then what i did expect from a book about a mail version of dungeons and dragons it's never specifically stated when the book is set or at least i didn't notice it but such game could be popular somewhere in the 19th century before the invention of the internet but still there's little if any reason for anyone to engage in a snail mail version of du0026amp d the whole fun of such games is based on getting together in a group and forming a party with each person playing a unique character and a seasoned gamemaster leading everyone through the adventure in real time there's a number of games which can be played in this way such as chess or strategic games requiring lots of planning but i'd argue that an epic quest isn't one still i would like to learn more about the game why was it successful what distinguished it from other attempts at the same thing but the game is only the background for the story with the obvious focus put on sean and his ruminations on various topics how art affects life the relationship between the real and the imagined sadly i never grew to like or even care about sean and his thoughts didn't give me anything new to think about the nature of his accident is also purposefully never entirely explained and the reader is never given much insight into sean's character and the novel's non linear structure jumps between the past and the present forcing the reader to put the pieces together which didn't help as i couldn't become interested in these pieces in the first place and in the end couldn't care about what happened at all i'm puzzled by all the great reviews and the nomination for a prestigious award obviously the book did something for other readers but it ended up doing absolutely nothing for me","283":"i'm not sure what to do with this book it's like a patchwork quilt or a pointillist painting if you look at it too closely it doesn't really make sense the pieces are disjointed and even clash a bit but when you step back and look at the whole thing you get the picture all those seemingly random pieces fall together it's touching and sad and weird and thought provoking i'm not sure whether i enjoyed it or not and i wouldn't call it a quick read but once i got about halfway through i couldn't put it down it was a unique reading experience which is something you don't often find so for that i'm giving it 4 stars update i highly recommend the literary disco podcast episode where they discuss this book i'm not quite as ecstatic about it as they are but they dissect the themes brilliantly and highlight all the great parts you might want to listen after you read though because even though they say at the outset that they're not going to spoil it they kind of do well todd does anyway","284":"this was terrific i feel so bad for sean though just so so bad someone please talk to me about the ending","285":" for years when people asked me to describe the mountain goats i found myself stumbling to find the right words prolific true but that doesn't say much ethereal foreboding hopeful well yes and no the best way i've found to describe their songs is music for broken people the shows are part stand up comedy routine part agnostic hymnal part aa meeting all wrapped up in the message you are not alone at least that's what i take away from it all though that may say more about me than about the music with wolf in white van darnielle again leaves me struggling to find the words to describe it properly at first i likened it to a temporal onion layers upon layers and sometimes the one you peel back reveals a layer you thought you had peeled completely already while poetic it's a bit non sensical there is a twisting disjointed madness to the narrative a sense of impending doom that will feel familiar to anyone who's listened to darnielle's lyrics but once more i can really only describe this as a story for broken people anyone that hovers at the edge of fantasy and reality and struggles to keep their darker thoughts at bay though sean the main character seems to have all of these traits turned up to 11 if you read this novel and find sean someone that you can't relate to be glad that probably means that you're a bit more well adjusted that i am or at the very least your demons are far different than mine it is also possible that there are bits of the book are so far out of my scope of experience that i didn't even register their importance while someone else will latch on to them like a life line this book won't be everyone's cup of tea but there is plenty about it to intrigue and engage most readers i look forward to watching and reading darnielle's evolution as a novelist assuming that he's as prolific with his books as he is with his music","286":"wow i was utterly floored by this stunning dark beautiful sad and brilliant my stomach becoming progressively more knotted as i intentionally slowed down my race to the last page not because of what was going to happen but because i knew my vacation in this world was going to end and i wasn't ready to leave thank you for giving this to us john please invite us back soon","287":"i really loved this book although i have never suffered from an injury such as the main character has suffered or tried to harm myself i felt a such a sense of identification with the main character i remember being the type of isolated person he was i remember ordering things from magazines i remember constantly thinking things and wondering which was the right path a beautiful dark yet hopeful book","288":" really dug this book hard to say 'enjoy' because it's about a man who survived shooting himself as a teenager now he lives alone making a living on the game he created back then which is played by snail mail not internet none of this is a spoiler it's the up front story but that's what got me the story of this man and his life now and coping with his scars physical and mental i've known people like him i bet a lot of us have if we've been paying attention he's not living for sympathy and he's not bitter he's just living","289":"this is for sure in my top five of 2014 this book was fantastic everything about it it was a two track story and both of them held my attention and kept me speculating until the very end here is the best part i was wrong about both i spent the entire book wondering why how and when you finally learn the answers it the banality of it that is shocking is that a spoiler i don't think so so good read it","290":"this book is like one long heartbreaking beautiful song i didn't really care to some extent that there were a few loose ends and untied knots since that's how the best lyrics are open ended i think this book is meant to be picked up over and over again played multiple times so that a new note can be heard every time","291":" do you think the tragic duo of lance and carrie were supposed to be or be a variation on the alpha couple from all those mountain goats songs the one thing i didn't buy in this otherwise fascinating and quick read was the fact that insurance would pay very much or at all for a self inflicted gunshot wound suicide attempt spoiler alert and i wish the book focused more on the play by mail game the conan the barbarian fixation provided some more background and involvement with sean's childhood friends also i could've done with a bit more explaining about the concept imagery and weight of the phrase wolf in white van it's symbolism as the avatar of life's traveling tricksters my take still darnielle nails the late 80s rock and roll satanic panic the creepiness of late night religious shows the purgatorial beauty the icy stillness of video arcades and grocery shopping but and this doesn't weigh into the novel's achievements i really didn't care for the blurbs on the back the blurbs were i mean daniel handler and john hodgens tired of those guys some children's writer and some snarky nerd daily show talking head they these two hold no serious literary cache which this novel deserves except to twee hipsters was jonathan lethem who has roundtabled with darnielle unavailable and one lady wrote an exquisitely eloquent blurb and then ruined it by summarizing the novel as absolutely fucking brilliant i mean why not just absolutely brilliant why the need to cuss i'm being serious here really","292":"wolf in white van is one of those novels that i just want to throw at people and yell read without giving them any context or explanation it is one of those novels that i want that i need to discuss with somebody to have them explain to me what i just read it is also one of those novels that is incredibly sad that makes you empathize with every single character john darnielle's debut novel is brilliant although i'm not entirely certain of what i just read 3 5 5","293":" loved reading this book but about half way through i didn't want it to end because i started to get a feeling that it wasn't going to deliver that perfect punch it was great writing and sean was a great character but i felt like there is something that just slightly missed the reverse order or out of order jumps felt more like a gimmick and him narrating things and intentionally leaving out things until the end but hinting at them the whole time felt coy and frustrating it also led to some parts not developing as well as i know this author can do without using spoilers i just felt sean's main conflict and the two gamers conflict to me were the most undeveloped things they lost some power somehow i can see why it almost won a nba i feel that's appropriate to how close this came to being a total bullseye","294":"excellent if dark read especially for a first novel john darnielle is amazingly talented and i can't wait to see what he writes next and to get an opportunity to see the mountain goats live","295":" there'll always be a few things maybe several thingsthat you're going to find really difficult to forgive up the wolves the mountain goatswolf in white van is about those things two incidents circled around alluded to brushed over poked at and one event that doesn't happen it's circular like a geeky kid rereading the same books and the books this book's protagonist sean reads should be familiar to a certain type of nerd conan fritz leiber spider robinson clark ashton smith i could smell the sci fi section of my library recall the glances between people who 'get it' that's maybe what wolf in white van is about the collision between people's personal worlds their internal mythologies disfigured sean invents a fallout like play by mail game that colonizes a few people's heads and might lodge in yours but it's not evil it's not corrupting it's an escape born of long solitude and somehow shared not much happens in wolf in white van most of it is a minute cataloging of sean's mind his shifts in vision his history and his need for stasis but that mind is a fascinating place to spend a few hours and at times it's frighteningly familiar john darnielle has such empathy for sean and sean has such empathy for others that it's hard not to love him just a little even though there are those things that are impossible to forgive","296":"i made it 10% in to this book and couldn't bring myself to pick it up again i felt dizzy trying to figure out what was happening the timing seemed to jump to at least 3 or 4 different time periods of the main characters life but there was little to go by to help me understand when and where i was with him at least i think it was a him i'm not even sure that was clear i can appreciate jumping between povs and time periods and in fact i love it when done with great skill stephen king is a master of this by this is not a skillful job of that","297":"this was a crazy read i never got into du0026amp d or any sort of derivation as a kid videogames having taken over my sensibilities early on and as i got older i started to see the nerd driven connotations the activity held mostly through poorly scripted television well that and i never knew anyone who played it which is why i was surprised to find how much i seemed to enjoy it in those two episodes of nbc's community whose 22 minute episodes featured a different takes on the game used as a backdrop in order to in on episode early on in show's run get the core group to understand accept each other and in the 5th season to reunite a father with his son but that digression has little to do with wolf in white van the story is told through sean philips a profoundly disfigured man who for the most part passes the time alone in his apartment his only company are his parents and a personal aid who administers his medical ministrations he's also the creator of trace italian a du0026amp d esque game played via traditional mail with players of all walks of life with sean acting as the so called dungeon master keeping track of characters who write back and forth to each other and for a small monthly fee attempt to find their way to the trace italian a place no player has actually reached much of the plot is two fold in setting up the mystery the first of what happened to sean and the second a lawsuit brought against him by parents of a teenaged girl who was found dead in a kansas ditch along with a boy who survived having seemingly attempted to incorporate the game into their waking lives i have to say right off that that second plot point in the last sentence immediately called to mind another real life instance of art affecting life the slender man murders where two disaffected girl stabbed another girl she survived in order to please the cult figure that story like this one involved a young person whose mind seemingly confused the real and mythical a mind so twisted and transformed that basic logic and reasoning could no longer be counted on to function normally what i especially liked about wiwv were its digressions into how the dungeon master who ostensibly has to remain objective becomes acclimated in a way to the lives of its players though he maintains his wall of anonymity the players themselves begin to relinquish facts about their lives or create reasons for missed late correspondences and you begin to get a sense of what these people think about their lives in relation to the game or their hold on sanity as it blurs between the game and real life anyway this is all stuff covered deeply in anime and movies serial experiments lain ghost in the shell transcendence etc but i've always found it interesting to see explored in storytelling mediums i also wanted to say that you have to admire the control restraint by darnielle there were times were i got the impression that the prose might trail off into ranting despair woe is me type of stuff which i probably couldn't really fault the protagonist for given what ultimately happens but like philips maintaining his silence in trace italian darnielle effectively restrains sean's voice to a level steady tone that communicates the facts of his situation and provides what i think are his honest to god best attempts at trying to discern the truth of things without veering off into sentimental or romantic fan fictiony type of stuff i really hope darnielle pursues a second book","298":"fantastic writing and game building i'm not sure about the plot view spoiler so much of this is jumbled up with past sean and present sean that i'm not sure what exactly was up with the ending this is a very in media res novel at times hide spoiler","299":"3 5 stars look i'll say upfront this review less a review than scatter shot personal impressions likely won't be helpful to anyone my tastes can be picayune and i think this book is a perfect example of that okay there are many excellent moments and pretty sentences but the whole didn't quite fit together for me speaking as a former high school misfit the former refers to high school not the misfit i dig me a good story from that pov but but i dig me a misfit story that takes a more honest look at the misfit maybe honest isn't a fair word for me to use but it's all i have i thought wiwv fetishized and elevated the game play and players a bit too much and sean was too precious at times and his avatar of suffering again fetishized a christ for all those nerds like me who would show them all someday and thematic apotheosis a bit too forcibly assigned deeper meaning jesus i feel like i have to explain why i only liked and didn't love this book and i'm flailing and failing miserably but there it is maybe i'll read it again later with a clearer head i can't tell you when that clarity would ever happen though","300":" through the text based rpg of trace italian some clouded memories and his lonely day to day routine sean phillips walks us through worlds both imaginary and horrifyingly real while climbing in reverse to the climax of his personal journey this climax is the beginning of a new chapter in sean's young life but it serves as the end to our journey with him i have absolutely tried so hard to carefully construct this review so as to get my true point across i did not hate the book in the least bit in fact i enjoyed reading it and appreciate darnielle's writing style i thought it was quick interestingly constructed unique because of this construction thought provoking and somewhat inspiring despite being slightly depressing however i also had a hard time relating to the protagonist and maybe that's because he was such a loner but i honestly felt like he would be someone that would be hard to be friends with even without drastic facial reconstruction i also hated his parents and i thought they were extremely selfish after his accident if there was an antagonist in this book it would be them another thing that got to me was trace italian's success after the expansion of the internet sean's character never really shared any details about just how many people played his game and i can appreciate the escape a game like that can bring but i thought handwritten letters back and forth between him and his customers was a bit far fetched when email would have been so much easier he could have easily reconstructed trace italian so that it would be more hip with the times but he was stuck on the idea of the mail in only game to the point where he even defended it within the novel i felt like a 3 star rating suggested i didn't enjoy the book which is why i bumped my rating up to four stars this is where i realize the rating system is flawed i'm even tempted to protest for half stars and i feel as though i'm not alone in this after much internal debate i decided to mentally give wolf in white van 3 5 stars although here on goodreads it looks like 4 5 even half stars wouldn't help me get my point across about this book though looking at all the different reviews and ratings i can fully understand why someone would give it one star and why another would give it five that's rare for me it almost makes me believe the author wanted that type of reaction as if he wanted readers to understand his book is not for everyone i can respect that and the mixed reviews were one major reason i was so intrigued to start this novel 3 5 stars in no way means i didn't enjoy the book for what it was i feel that i didn't love or hate it though and 3 5 feels fair back to the book itself we know for a long time what is going to happen at the end or beginning rather of his story even though my heart was beating faster the closer i got to the edge when the moment of climax occurred i wasn't moved i read the last paragraph three different times even though i knew what was going to happen way before i got there this wasn't like a ha i figured out what happened first but more of a yeah that's what you've been telling us would happen for about 100 pages john i wanted to know why sean did what he did to alter his lifestyle in such a way he walks us through the process that occurs before the big moment but he never really hints on what made him want to do it did he just want to leave us wondering and trying to make sense of it forever if his goal was to get us to reread it from beginning to end to try and figure it out i'm sure he has a pretty successful rate i won't be reading it again though","301":"as a huge tmg fan i have had my eyes on this book since before it came out but i was worried about disliking it and dislodging that pure respect for jd's writing and imagination this worry was a true waste of effort the first several chapters are very disorienting reminding me of staring at a single brick directly in front of my eyes the wall to which it belongs not yet revealed the revelation process of this book is slow indeed but it is as satisfyingly thorough in all the gory details as you might like the only element that remains elusive to the reader is the same answer sean phillips' parents are seeking through the many flashbacks initially incomprehensible the idea that sean's parents have barely disguised anger and hurt running interference for their parental instincts falls easily into place sean can't or won't open himself up reach out and explain his actions it would be easy to think this distance owes its existence to the accident we all see coming long before the final pages but that would be a mistake flashbacks to a pre disfigurement sean point to a gap that nobody seemed very concerned about addressing particularly because it manifested in that adolescent stage where sharing and connecting with parents is so undesirable the coolest parents were the ones that knew nothing sean says i would recommend this to any fan of the mountain goats anybody who looks fondly back on metal music teenage angst and anyone who has ever acted on an instinct beyond comprehension sean is driven forward almost instinctively at every turn from his accident to the creation of his rich inner world of the trace italian to his personal choices around interacting with other people and living his life i don't suggest following his example but we can all relate to the kernel of impulsiveness that drives the teenage experience","302":"intelligently written and intense i didn't like it as much as other readers seem to but it does get me thinking about life choices and paths definitely thought provoking","303":"i think i would give it a 3 5 right now i loved reading it until i approached the end and was frustrated i needed something more i can see how that's consistent with its message that there are no answers and i wonder if a closer reading without small noisy children around would yield some beautiful symmetries or patterns or subtler meanings but obviously i can't tell if those are there or if i wish they were","304":"i read the first chapter of this book before i slept and then when i woke i read all the rest of it at once minus a break for a snack i don't know quite what i think but i know i enjoyed it i also would like to own this to read it over and over because it's definitely one of those books where you learn more and more the more you read it the deeper you delve","305":"this is the first book by the lead member of the band the mountain goats although in recent years their music hasn't interested me as much as it had in the past i still recall listening to an interview with john darnielle a few years back and being impressed with darnielle's elaborately and intriguing detailed answers to the interviewers inquiries it seemed that he had a great knack for storytelling and i was captivated in listening that is what peeked my interest into reading wolf in white van and overall i'm quite glad that i did the imagination and daydreaming mind of the main character and the manner in which darnielle crafts the story maintained my interest and engagement with this book and because of that i will be sure to seek out any future titles he releases in fact i could actually see myself rereading this book again in the near future","306":"i can't give this book one star because it's not bad per say but it definitely wasn't the book for me i usually get books even ones i don't like i didn't get this book it seemed like two entirely different stories sewn together haphazardly","307":"i got to about page 33 of 200 and still nothing was happening it felt like reading the lines to a really boring game of dungeons and dragons in which you have no clue about any of the characters or settings","308":"wow just wow wolf in white van is a must read for sure","309":"i'm not sure how to describe this book i started out enjoying the path it was taking me on and willing to give some of the obvious plot detours a forgiving eye however as the story went on and the plot got more thin i just lost interest and couldn't relate at all i appreciate what the story was trying to achieve but it didn't meet that end for me","310":" sean phillips' appearance is beyond ugly facially disfigured since the age of seventeen he rarely ventures out avoiding the burden of other people's reactions p84 people don't expect to meet me they don't know they have expectations but i show them by counterexample what their expectations were lance and carrie have also had their teenage lives destroyed but it turns out that they weren't party to the incident that so dreadfully damaged sean but overly eager participants in a post apocalyptic role play adventure game trace italian of which sean is both inventor and administrator carrie's parents try to prove sean accountable through the courts echoing his own parents' search for meaning in his own self destructive behaviour p97 my parents had their own version of it which was linear it told the story about me staying up late and reading things and watching things that told me to do something awful staring too long at the static screen full review http annegoodwin weebly com annecdo","311":"i don't want to say this is the world's best book and if i could give half stars i would have gone with 4 5 even so it's ambitious and the turns of phrase and just general mood that john darnielle summons forth in this book is much akin to what he does in the songs by his band the mountain goats told in a sort of reverse narrative things were a bit jumbled at first but it didn't take long to hook me and i really enjoyed this one","312":"this is one of those books that you need to read again and again it's different interesting dark need to read it again","313":"so sad but i didn't really get how sad it was while i was reading it it's a permeating sadness","314":" i'm not sure what to think of this novel just having finished i'm frustrated and disappointed by it someone who enjoyed the book will say that's the point you're supposed to be frustrated and disappointed and in a sense surely you are it's a story about searching for meaning in the senseless the need to construct fiction in order to deal with the gaping holes of cause and effect and motivation that we find in the real world but still this novel is unsatisfying regardless of whether that's the point if i write a song with no rhythm no melody no harmony no rhymes and then say that's the point that doesn't make my song any better that's an extreme example of course and darnielle has actually put together a pretty solid thought provoking story but something still feels a little hollow in the end i was also expecting a bit more of darnielle stylistically he's such a phenomenal lyricist that i really expected some great sentences from this novel but the writing is all pretty straightforward with little of the punch that his lyrics hold","315":"this novel didn't live up to my expectations at all i found the blurb very misleading i expected that sean was a moderator of a mmorpg and that two teens lance and carrie would get into real life trouble because of taking the game too seriously it turns out lance and carrie are only briefly mentioned and that the story is most of all about sean who had an accident at the age of 17 he is the inventor of a snail mail rpg i never heard of games like these before maybe i'm too young i'm 23 sean is a very imaginative character with interesting and unexpected ways of thinking about things in life but i couldn't relate to him at all the novel isn't written in a chonological order and for me the timeline wasn't clear is he around 30 years old now maybe there were a lot of flashbacks to when when he was 10 15 no idea the combination of the for me misleading blurb the confusing timeline and flashbacks and the fact that i couldn't relate to sean at all made this book a real miss for me it could be that i totally missed the point but i don't know for sure and don't want to spend my time re reading this book to find out i finished the novel only because it was 207 pages long else i wouldn't have bothered at all","316":"i finished this book and thought it was ok but not really my cup of tea it had an interesting premise it felt well written in some parts but too self conscious in others like the author was trying to make the narrator tell his story and that made the narration seem forced it was like trying to get a confession out of someone with attention deficit disorder and just getting a loosely tied narrative with different bits and pieces coming in out of the blue then i got back to the beginning and happened to read the epigraph a second time actually i forgot it completely the first time i read it anyway and it clicked that person there was me with the finished book \"and the treasure \"\"there was no gold there nothing and then i started reading again and more bits and pieces clicked into place right now i'm thinking that he talked about puzzles and that he was not really good at them and this clicked also but now i feel that i have to go and look up that part again before writing this i happened upon a snippet of a review and it said that the book should have never ended that for people who liked it and wanted more it should have been like the game a new chapter every week after you send the money but my guess is that there's actually no need for it it's circular there is no end and that's the whole beauty of it the parts fit together in so many possible ways so it all boils down to a piece of advice don't put the book down once you've finished it you owe it to yourself because it might feel like you've actually wasted those two or three days to read it","317":"oh geez so bleak i kind of wish it had a sadness warning on it somewhere but i did really really like it","318":" book by musicians even musicians whose lyrics are as literary as john darnielle's aren't supposed to be this good i had resisted reading this for a while and after constant torrents of good reviews i decided to give it a shot i'm glad i did i went in with a very basic idea of what it was about and it surprised me greatly the story itself is told in a unique way but isn't jarring it is substance over style the idea itself is completely original and strange for such a short novel i was surprised to go on such a journey with the characters highly recommend","319":"i love john darnielle i think he's a fantastic writer this books fully explores the thoughts and outlook of a really strange individual strange is probably the wrong word at least it feels wrong because his emotions and thoughts have a beauty and reality to them that i think everyone can relate to there's so many great moments in this book that just feel so human and alive there is not much of an overarching plot structure to some degree the plot runs in reverse but the term plot is a bit of a stretch it's more of a guided tour of this person's life and mind","320":"sweeping intense dream like incredibly sad beautiful prose believable perspective of a teenage loner need a day or two to seep it all in and listen to the entire mountain goats discography","321":"i feel like i've missed some vital connection to this character he seems to have spoken to so many other readers having survived an extreme incident of self harm sean is mostly reclusive rarely seeing anyone besides his caregivers he describes dispassionately the horror his face inspires in others how uncomfortable it makes people watching him speak being discouraged to attend a close relative's funeral while hospitalized he invented the world of 'trace italian' a game played entirely by postal mail this is where i expected him to have escaped the world of his physical disfiguration and loneliness into some fantastical imaginary world but there was no such impression the trace is just a job to sean choose your own adventure style he picks a preformulated response to whatever his subscriber has written in to do and off it goes so how did lance and carrie whose personalities are barely revealed become so involved in this game they were treating it as real the game as described just doesn't seem like it could be that immersive the book was not what i was expecting or quite like anything i have read before the structure revealed what was coming but none of the motivation despite sean's introspection i don't feel i understood him at all","322":"nope this book was not for me as much as i love his songwriting i couldn't really enjoy this weird book i was interested enough to keep reading but when i finished it my first thought was i didn't really like this book","323":" i finished this book a couple of hours ago and i'm still not quite sure how i feel about it on the one hand i think it was brilliantly written with beautiful prose on the other hand even up until the end i was still kind of confused what the main plot was it is definitely a thought provoking book but some of that was lost on me because i spent a fair amount of time just trying to figure out what timeline i was reading the story skips around between sean's past and present life as of now i'll give it 3 5 stars but that might change as i have more time to think about it","324":"i really wanted this book to be good it could have been but it felt like it was some kind of ego circle jerk geared towards a very specific group of people","325":" this was very obviously a first novel and i found the prose and pacing bumpy nevertheless i enjoyed the book and the good parts shone i loved the premise and thought the character and circumstances of the narrator were deftly handled the pacing was uneven and while the prose was lovely at times it also seemed like it was trying too hard here and there in the end though i found it captivating and haunting i'd recommend this to anyone who has patience with a sometimes uneven book and i'll definitely be reading whatever john darnielle publishes next","326":" the mountain goats is one of my favourite bands and john darnielle one of my absolute favourite songwriters with songs that feel more like short stories than actual songs needless to say i was pretty excited for this novel and while it had a ton of great prose it never really connected with me in the way i hoped some parts of the book hit home made me tear up made me shocked and thoughtful made me think about my own childhood darnielle is great at making you feel like you just stepped into someone else's life but it left me a little cold altogether i'm willing to blame it on the ton of other books i've been reading simultaneously it's hard to really connect with one book when you're reading ten and should've finished five of them by now and the fact that i used a long long time to read this 200 page novel it really was lovely in parts and beautifully written so i'm getting ready for a second look when i can just read this and not feel guilty or have a thousand other things on my mind i think i'd be able to get lost in this then to really explore its world and its characters or maybe i'll feel the same that this is a debut novel and feels like it either way i'm very interested in what darnielle does next","327":"if i was going to choose indie musicians to successfully transition into a second career as a novelist john darnielle would certainly be at or near the top of the list i'm happy to report that darnielle delivers the goods a thoughtful concise reflection on lost youth and the thin line separating lonely outcast kids and very bad things happening the basic premise of the novel is that a disfigured young man all we know at the outset is that he has some kind of elephant man style face runs an rpg by mail and is brought into a period of intense reflection by the death and injury of two of his games' players as the novel progresses we gain more insight into sean phillips' character and the event that permanently disabled him what happened to sean isn't necessarily all that surprising in spite of this backwards storytelling reveal moreover it's troubling and sad the way a kid who lived in his imagination ended up taking a wrong turn definitely recommended and i hope that darnielle keeps writing p s somebody tell blake schwarzenbach and craig finn that their contemporary just got a national book award nomination i want this indie lyrical master transitioning to novelist thing to catch on","328":"august 2014 i pre ordered a copy as soon as it was announced no cover no synopsis no nothing must have been around march now the due date is approaching and the wait is getting painful the synopsis is amazing i just ghkwshjfjkqfnjfnkds september 2014i don't know what to think about it just yet it was one hell of a ride","329":" a unique and compelling book that explores sadness disconnection and worlds within worlds i have no idea how darnielle came up with the idea of this book after a failed suicide attempt a young man creates a play by mail rpg called trace italian that takes place in an irradiated post apocalyptic america a young couple decides to play the game as if it were real with disastrous results darnielle the singer songwriter of the mountain goats weaves a surreal story that ebbs and flows between flashbacks of his childhood trial hearings and the creation of his game this is a fast read and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in a novel with a different structure and an unusual character study that's truly moving","330":"in a nutshell i didn't like this book it wasn't that it was depressing although it was it wasn't that it was drawn out in all the wrong places either although it was that too i just felt there was a lot of potential given the depth of the story itself but i found the novel still barely scratched the surface given such deep subject matter i wanted to know more about the how's why's and what ifs instead i found wolf in a white van surprisingly dry and unremarkably short however it's length is probably the only reason why finished it at all","331":"very well written incredibly descriptive beautiful but sometimes dancing around a central plot works and sometimes it sort of waltzes out the door this one definitely belongs in the latter category and i was left a little unsatisfied","332":"a multi layered labyrinth has all the makings of a cult classic and it wouldn't surprise me if trace italian crops up in the real world of gaming novel speaks to inescapable and suffocating feelings of otherness of pathways in life with options so numerous sometimes if feels like the only choice is not to choose gripping mysterious and disturbing i loved it","333":"liked some of the ideas was a bit nonplussed by the execution","334":"wolf in white van is a disturbing look at a young mind reading it left me restless the narrative draws you in and is engrossing yet almost hard to read the final act of the boom was somewhat hard to follow the writing a little to manic but still worth a read you can easily finish the book in a sitting but you will have to watch a puppy video after to cleanse your pallet","335":" sean the main character and actually only character and narrator had an accident when he was 17 he now lives as a recluse and makes some extra cash by running a textbased roleplaying game by mail interesting concepts and ideas about choices but i found that the story lacked some sort of engaging factor maybe if we'd met sean before u0026amp after i didn't feel very connected to the character though i did feel like the author knew him well and had put a lot of thought into the book and the concepts i would recommend this book if you want to explore the concept but not the story","336":" wolf in white van is the story of a teenager young man who grew up in a life of enui and escapism he suffers a disfiguring \"accident\" and lives his life running a complex play by mail role playing game john darnielle the author has been called \"the greatest lyricist of his generation\" i have never heard one of his songs but after reading his debut novel i believe it darnielle's prose has an infectious quality that creeps into your skull there were many points during my reading where i felt that i was sitting among the characters and watching the story it helped that i shared many traits with the protagonist such as a love of conan and fantasy and a willingness to use that fantasy to escape the doldrums of suburban existence reading this book made me feel like i was becoming delusional from inhaling the smoke coming of the burning ruins of my childhood the main character runs a play by mail game called trace italian this allows him to earn money while staying at home since his accident has left his face horribly damaged he invented the game while recovering in the hospital players in the game try to navigate a post apocalyptic landscape in order to reach the safety of the trace italian a mythical fort built by survivors players are constantly making choices on their quest to security which is forever out of reach the whole novel is a meditation on the choices we make and the blame we try to place when tragedy hits as well as fantasy and reality and their intersection in our minds there is a slightly longer version of this review on my blog sphereofannihilation","337":" looking for a light uplifting heartwarming tale you've not chosen wisely forage for another book john darnielle's lyrical prose style is engrossing but this is one bleak tale told in reverse order from the self inflicted disfiguring gunshot wound to the depressing present ish day wolf in white van presents the life of a lonely but creative teen who is a master of imagination and world building the world we get a peek at is that of the trace italian an apocalyptic role playing game reminiscent of dungeons u0026amp dragons and choose your adventure books where players make moves via the almost forgotten s a s e as our protagonist befriends two teenage players whom he has never met disaster strikes readers of chuck palahniuk's survivor and fans of the mountain goats are sure to enjoy wolf in white van","338":" i read this not knowing what to expect outside of my experience of listening to the mountain goats but that gives enough space to set expectations somewhat traumatic event coping with said event this isn't a book with a resolution or a grand statement or a plot so to speak this is a book that looks at decisions how one lives after they are made and how things spiral out of control but not necessarily why because there isn't always a why if you pick this up expecting a story with a beginning middle and end you'll be disappointed pick it up as an empathetic look into the mind of someone who no longer connects with others how they got there and why they stay","339":" wolf in white van refers to the cryptic phrases supposedly revealed by listening to records backwards which those of us old enough to get all the pop culture references in this book will recall was one of the big moral panics incited by christian evangelicals back in the 80s in one of many scenes described by the first person narrator sean in this non linear novel he actually calls one of those evangelical stations as a child during their prayer hour to ask about this phenomena of course the astute reader will also realize that it's a clever reference to the book itself since it starts at the end and unravels back to the beginning of what eventually lead sean to the trial with which the book begins sean created a play by mail game called trace italian in which the players journey across a post apocalyptic america searching for a mysterious location called trace italian they send in their moves and sean selects a few boilerplate paragraphs from his files customizes them a bit and sends them back it might seem very strange if you never played one of these games i did play a lot of pbm games back in the 80s and 90s they were a lot of fun the internet mostly killed the industry of course the more savvy pbm companies moved to email and web based gaming but as sean tells us even though he expected the internet to kill his game as well he retains a loyal following even into the 21st century still sending in moves by old fashioned snail mail this makes trace italian a sort of cult phenomenon which fits with the events in the book in which sean mostly confined to a secluded existence thanks to a horrible disfigurement briefly touches the lives of his players and gets glimpses and more often speculations about their diverse outside lives through the handful of sentences they exchange every couple of weeks in the medium of the game it gives the entire book the same mysterious opaque feeling as the game described within the book in which it's never quite known what is going on but everyone is drawn in trying to put the pieces together in the beginning we learn that two teenage players of sean's game tried to play it in real life apparently convinced that the game was giving them clues to things they could find in the real world this ended in a sad and tragic fashion and the parents of one of the teens blamed sean and sued him from there we go backwards we know initially only that sean is terribly disfigured his voice is difficult to understand his face makes people look away eventually we learn how he became disfigured but the details the hows and whys and circumstances are parceled out bit by bit as sean continues moving back and forth from his present existence as the creator of a strange little postal game that gives him a meager supplement to his income to the events that caused teenaged sean to become a lonely disabled monster events which are echoed in the lawsuit back in his present this is an odd interesting and clever book and i'd like to have liked it more i got all the references the conan novels the science fiction magazines the pbm games the moral majority and their hysteria about satanic messages in rock music and i do appreciate clever and different novels but i'm not that impressed by ambiguous novels i don't need everything spelled out for me i am okay with the author leaving some questions unanswered but in the end i still had no understanding of what troubled sean what caused him to do what he did what he was besides an angsty kid with a difficult relationship with his parents maybe that is all the author intended me to understand and he built this short novel about a troubled kid on layers of self referential narrative devices and cultural easter eggs to be unearthed like the mysteries in trace italian it was an ambitious effort that didn't quite land for me so i can only give it 3 5 stars which i will round up to 4 because i'd probably try reading something by john darnielle again","340":"it is hard to know what to make of this book it deals with some big topics loneliness and isolation depression etc these are things you might expect in an adult book but the writing style is more like a teenage fiction story although at the age of 53 i don't really read many of those to be able to comment the narrator is right though trace italian is a wondrously poetic phrase and i sort of wish more had been made of the game within the book but i don't know how that would work in the end an entertaining read but for me vaguely disappointing because it felt a bit all over the place","341":" this is one of those peel back the layers narratives where the protagonist gradually reveals the details of a pivotal event until finally you get the big scene in this case the narrator is sean phillips who was left severely disfigured by an accident when he was a teenager he reflects upon his life since and the life he had before that much of it in the context of a play by post game that he invented the way darnielle weaves these threads is tremendously deft and on the whole i found it to be a very compelling read it doesn't quite look that way given the dates on my reading but i read about 30 40 pages and then had to put all my reading aside when i picked it up again i started over and read it in just a few sittings but for as much of a wow reading experience it was i wasn't sure how i felt about the big scene you will know the basic contents of it long before it happens there's dread it as it plays out and by the end my eyes were bugging out a bit it's not badly done but it felt like something was missing there's a promise of depth throughout and i totally felt like darnielle was delivering it up until that point view spoiler i came away feeling like the adult that simply didn't understand seriously why hide spoiler that's why the book sat here starless for a week it's possible some of what i want is buried in there and would be discovered upon rereading i did flip back a few times as new things were revealed and it was pretty satisfying to see the groundwork there when it came to the lance carrie stuff i admit i wished there'd been a little more depth on that too though so overall a great reading experience for me but i wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of love hate over this one","342":"holy moly this book is in my head","343":"missed the brilliance promised from the back cover interesting idea that fell short on me","344":"this book does a really great job of describing the inner world of imagination and how hard to explain the momentous and terrible things that happen in life are the way it is written is really engrossing and lyrical not surprising given that it's written by john darnielle from the mountain goats","345":"i'm just so glad i'm not a teenage boy anymore","346":"holy sh t he's a brilliant lyricist but i truly had no idea he had something like this book in him wow","347":" you know from his song lyrics that he has a way with a sentence but wolf actually shows how deeply darnielle has considered the roots and expressions of isolation the story follows a young man whose life was reshaped by a single act of violence tracing his path from youth to maturity always circling around the traumatic moments trying to penetrate the unsolvable maze of self not propulsive but haunting like following a series of aftershocks in towards the epicenter to comb the wreckage that remains if there were a game like trace italian in our world i would want to play","348":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i deeply love a lot of john darnielle's music and his whole approach to life really but i put off reading this book for a long time only finally getting to it when someone gave it to me as a christmas gift my instinct upon finishing it was to give it 5 stars but i worried i was just giving jd the benefit of the doubt because i'm a fan i thought about docking it a few stars because so many people have so many compelling reasons for not liking it but i liked it it haunts me it bugs me a i deeply love a lot of john darnielle's music and his whole approach to life really but i put off reading this book for a long time only finally getting to it when someone gave it to me as a christmas gift my instinct upon finishing it was to give it 5 stars but i worried i was just giving jd the benefit of the doubt because i'm a fan i thought about docking it a few stars because so many people have so many compelling reasons for not liking it but i liked it it haunts me it bugs me a lot of that has to do with its ambiguity the whole book seems to be leading up to an explanation for sean's accident which reviewers persist in calling an accident even though you learn fairly early on in the text that he got shot in the face and it wasn't exactly an accident which seems somehow tied to what happened to lance and carrie and how sean feels about it but the ending does't answer these questions in a direct or conventional way i think that ambiguity is a feature not a bug like it's not as if darnielle has secret knowledge he's not sharing with us rather in the world of the book these things happened they just did no big clear plan or epiphany and the things sean learned the things that tie him to the world are kind of inscrutable which seems real to me i'm glad i read this book and i'm sure i'll be thinking about it for a long time although since i read it between a little life and the long hard road out of hell i'll probably confuse events from these three books all of which are narratives about how troubled american boys grow up more","349":"admittedly not as amaaaaazing as i had hoped but kept me engaged and i liked his writing i think because it kept me engaged that's probably my disappointment with what felt like a lackluster conclusion both regarding sean and the trace players was expecting a little more for the conclusion","350":"oblique and circular i'm not entirely sure how i'll feel thinking about this novel later but i know how i felt reading it amd that's all that matters","351":"3 5 this is not a plot heavy book instead a slow reveal tour through the mind of an isolated disfigured misfit who makes idiosyncratic text based games for other people who struggle to fit in in the world the narrator is a classic darnielle character like one of the kids from best ever death metal band out of denton who channels his angst into fantasy worlds rather than metal - and the writing is as good as you'd expect from one of pop music's smartest lyricists it's pretty grim reading with shafts of light peaking through occasionally - not really great summer reading","352":"a difficult read at first wolf in white van picks up quickly and captivates throughout the rest of it's 200 ish pages it explores how media and art impact us especially when we are young and how we interact with those things it also dives into imagination how it can be an escape a path to something more real a danger and so much more wolf in white van looks deeply at loss the games we play the lives we imagine and the stories we hold onto it's quite beautiful","353":"this was one of the most difficult and strange books i've read i had to constantly push myself to read this book every time i read a para a page i hated it i wanted to abandon it many times i did at times too but always came back not because its good but i wanted to know what the hell is it all about i finished it and i honestly feel robbed of the time which i could've spent reading a better one in the entire book there isn't a single line that i could highlight single line that made me connect to the character the cover is brilliant the synopsis was cool but the book the book is a failure","354":"the narrator of wolf in white van is young man horribly disfigured in an accident he may also be responsible for the deaths of two teenagers dealing with his own loss and the alienation he feels from society people stare at him in disgust his parents want him out of their hose he creates aa old fashioned mail based role playing game called trace italian trapped inside himself he makes an imaginary world that allows him to have contact with the real one the author john darnielle is songwriter and considering his lyric style pretty close to prose storytelling wolf in white van is surprisingly poetic he takes a tragic event and weaves a story of adolescent regret prog rock and the power of art for a book that takes place primarily in the head of one person it's pretty compelling the only quibble i have is the portrayal of the parents they're reduced to one dimensional disapproving authority figures regardless of how you feel about the mountain goats wolf in white van is a very good book","355":"an interesting character study but lacked pop","356":" like so many books i came to this one under false pretenses blurbs are so so devious fortunately for wolf in white van i was actually amazed by what i found my initial understanding that this novel was the story told in reverse of a crazy maniac who creates and runs mail order games is only about half accurate if you thought that was this book too it's not fair warning it is about a man sean phillips who creates and runs mail order role playing games think du0026amp d but you're playing alone and mailing in your moves to sean he is pretty housebound because his face was badly damaged in an accident circumstances which we initially are not sure of these games allow him to interact with other people without having to deal with their constant horror sympathy and scrutiny of his injuries this is a great life for sean except when it suddenly goes wrong a young couple engrossed in his most popular text game trace italian a post apocalyptic survival story starts to lose their grasp on reality thinking that the game is a reflection of real life they venture out to the midwest to find the hallowed fort that all players are struggling to reach it goes wrong there are serious consequences and sean is stuck feeling guilty and innocent at the same time so not at all about a maniac and technically the story runs in reverse in that toward the end we find out what happened to sean but it's more of a memory novel than a backwards narrative i was initially disappointed to discover that my presuppositions were wrong and then i was delighted what you'll find if you read darneille's debut is something way better sean is a great character one of the best i've read this whole year he's sad he's quiet he's isolated he's lonely he's a loner if you're looking for a thrilling plot based novel then never you mind because this is one that's all about character and it's done deliciously i can't express how gripping his psyche is how enraptured the reader feels while he's lost in his thoughts typically i'm not a fan of heady novels but wolf in white van really did it for me it's a bit difficult to review because so much of it is centered around sean's inner dialogue it's not even that there are spoilers really there aren't it feels silly to explain how good the book is how carefully it was written when you could just read it yourself it's a very short but it's worth every page i'm struggling more than i thought i would with a review for this book my shortest summary then this novel is a delight a painful character study and you should read it my rating 5 5http jonathanlikesbooks blogspot com","357":"one of the most stressful books i read in the last months there are so many things happening and so little information about what's going on that you can't stop thinking about all the possibilities just to find out that you actually have no idea what's going on","358":"an impressive debut novel from one of my favorite musicians i found the plot construction to be endearingly complex and written in such a way as to mimic the plot of trace italian the game within the book i though sean was a compelling narrator and the writing was as impressive as i would expect from john darnielle overall an excellent read though lacking in what would have made it truly outstanding","359":"i want to collect my thoughts on this more but suffice to say i am destroyed and you owe it to yourself to read it i bought it when it came out but i've been saving it for months because i knew i could only read it for the first time once and now i don't know what to do anymore","360":"john darnielle singer songwriter of the mountain goats is releasing his first novel wolf in white van on sept 16 2014 a combustion of literary ingenuity and melodic narrative wolf in white van is a philosophically charged work of genius the narrator sean phillips recounts his story in reverse revealing the darkness of his past and present life in rationed telling from the outset the reader knows that sean is disfigured from an \"accident\" that he \"did\" to himself in his youth however the details of the incident are not made clear all at once like a mystery novel or an rpg video game with an intense plotline sean's story plays itself out with the turning of each page culminating to reveal the whole of the story only on the final folio sean is the writer and developer of trace italian a role playing game that is experienced via snail mail a gamer is sent a prompt in which a scene in an apocalyptic future is described to her she is then given four options as to what her next move can be she must chose one move and mail her response back to sean she is then sent a new prompt based on her choice players continue to navigate sean's world via these four simple choices at the bottom of each page and sean continues to develop relationships with and stories about his players through the words and moves they return to him sean is a lonely genius with a wildly diverse inner dialogue vacillating between the uber humane and the utterly depressed darnielle poignantly breaks down barriers of labels and absolutes with the versatility of his characters namely sean even if he is \"depressed\" or \"disturbed\" sean is human and the reader is permeated with his humanity despite his twisted dark imagination thoughts and sometimes actions there is a light of joy compassion and pureness about sean that darnielle is able to access and express a novel of insight and intrigue darnielle does not shy away from difficult topics and perverse subject matter nothing is taboo and every shadow is brilliantly illuminated in darnielle's emotionally turbulent first novel http chicagoist com 2014 09 07 wolf","361":" sean phillips lives an isolated life since a disfiguring injury that happened when he was seventeen to past the time in his southern californian apartment he has created an interactive survival strategy game called trace italian which can be played via mail two high school students lance and carrie from florida start exploring the world of trace but manage to take their role playing into the real world disaster strikes and sean is called on to account for his actions and figure out how this could happen for those of you that don't know john darnielle is the singer songwriter for the indie folk rock band the mountain goats while the band is currently a three piece darnielle had been the sole member for many years wolf in white van is the first novel by john darnielle and the man knows how to write when a musician turns to writing i feel a little hesitant but darnielle's debut blew my expectations out of the water wolf in white van sets itself apart from most debut novels by going for something different and more complex wolf in white van is an interesting novel to talk about because the structure of the book is told backwards so the readers are given the beginning of the story and the climax right at the end of the novel this structure works really well with exploring the character of sean phillips and slowly it is revealed just how he ended up so isolated and lonely this allows for the exploration of loneliness and the game trace italian is an interesting device that allows others who are also lonely to interact with sean phillips i am fascinated by this game trace italian first of all it is unique in the sense that it is a text based survival game that is played through the mail people send their next move and based on that sean phillips sends them the next part of the game the goal of the game is to make it to safety in the post apocalyptic world while there is a possibility of completing the game sean believes that no one will ever do so there is also the events that happen with lance and carrie which while not really a spoiler i will not mention it except to say this event explores the ideas of artist responsibility there is constantly stories where music movies or video games are blamed for tragic events and the way john darnielle explores this issue is very interesting at least from a creator's point of view the idea that this novel is told backwards really plays on the whole idea of playing music backwards may reveal hidden satanic messages wolf in white van is a brilliant debut full of unexpected depth it is a fascinating character study and there is so many interesting themes to explore within this novel i am extremely impressed with john darnielle and i hope there are many more novels to come from this brilliant songwriter and author wolf in white van may sound like a it is heavily focused on this role playing game but really it is a character driven novel that just involves a game highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in the themes mentioned above this review originally appeared on my blog http literary exploration com 2015","362":"my first thoughts a brilliant intricate masterpiece and i don't use words like brilliant or masterpiece lightly as soon as i finished i went back to the beginning the end and the beginning fit like puzzle pieces it's dreamy and trippy and i'll not soon be able to shake that world full disclosure i'd heard of the mountain goats but wasn't familiar with their music so i checked them out but didn't like them at all","363":"intrigued but not super compelled well to be honest too scared to finish and i have to return it from the person i borrowed it from i'll definitely read more by darnielle","364":"i'm still kind of wrapping my head around this book john darnielle drops you in the middle of the story much like he does with his songs it takes some time to figure things out","365":"i'm not 100% sure how to describe this book i hunted this book down after reading a few favorable reviews on sites i frequent the premise seemed intriguing and i loved the cover design though brief this novel gives a lot to chew on i wouldn't say there are any wow moments just a slow burn that keeps you thinking about the book for days after you finish reading it","366":"i missed something and don't blame the book for it any opinions interpretations are more than welcome","367":"i could not sleep after i read this book it was beautiful and unsettling","368":"i liked the story more than the writing which is weird","369":" i was blown away by the writing in this book i have some mixed emotions about the plot points and the motivations of some of the characters but not to the book's detriment actually i think this adds to my experience of reading this book and would be a great thing to discuss with others i loved how the topics of reality fantasy and past present were handled and how i was forced to examine my own sense of normal i hope that darnielle continues to write novels i'll definitely be reading his next","370":"i'm still reeling so i'll write a coherent review later but oh my gosh i just don't think there is anything quite like this","371":"i just did not get this book i mean i understood what happened in it but i don't understand the hype the story was pretty interesting but the writing did not grab me i also felt it jumped around a lot it didn't help that it started at the end and worked backwards in time not bad but not amazing","372":" john darnielle is the writer of many great songs in his band the mountain goats which is my favourite band largely due to his lyrics his songs are little stories you want to know where the people in his songs got to this point and what they will do afterwards i was really looking forward to this when i heard he was putting out a novel what would he be able to accomplish in prose i can say i am not disappointed for a story about a man that has very little social interaction you are still intrigued and want to know where he's going and how he got here i will say darnielle does seem to suffer from first book clunkiness but i'm sure that will improve with hopefully more novels","373":" already the best songwriter of his generation john darnielle turns his substantial gift for the written word to literature and predictably knocks it out of the park wolf in white van is imaginative involving and deeply moving the superficial central mystery how isolated protagonist sean received his disfiguring facial scars keeps you hooked but it's the way darnielle guides us through the twisty fractured corridors of sean's mind that really gets under your skin an essential read one of 2014's best","374":"a very peculiar book indeed it took me about 50 pages before i really got into it and from then on it was an easy read i love the writing style and overarching structure of the novel it's no secret that john darnielle is a very very gifted writer however there isn't a single part of me that is into rpging larping gaming or anything of that sort and i think that is where this book fell flat for me the overall plot was great but i found myself skipping through a lot of the gameplay i think if you love gaming and unique storytelling this will be a 5 star story in your book i would still recommend it though for anyone who enjoys an unconventional story structure","375":"a fascinating book about two different tragedies both self made it's a book very much written for forty year olds who remember going to used book stores and finding old copies of doc savage conan and edgar rice burroughs it's for people who remember the satanic scare of 80's metal it's very much a picture of the past and how it shapes the narrator's life more i won't say other than i enjoyed it","376":"whoa speechless","377":"i really thought this book was going to be awesome and conceptually it could have been i just felt like it could have fleshed out more i feel like i missed something","378":"it was an easy read very down to earth language and kept me interested the whole book through but when i finished it i didn't feel accomplished at all i don't think i really took anything away from it and that was a little disappointing but darnielle is a great writer and love lyrical way that his story came together","379":"i'm bummed i can't give this a higher rating i've been a huge fan of darnielle's since i heard beautiful rat sunset in '94 plenty of ink has gone to describing darnielle's lyrical genius so i won't retread there but i do remember thinking that i would love a novel from this man he can wield language like a scalpel u0026amp can paint the picture of an entire relationship in a single line i always wanted him to write a novel about his 'alpha couple' a dysfunctional married couple that stayed and drank together through endless bad times that were featured in many songs over the years but alas that's not the book i got i love some parts of this book the occasional simile or metaphor interesting descriptions of horrific and commonplace things etc i guess my issue was with the narrative it seemed arbitrary as if the synopsis were constructed out of phrases drawn out of a hat after spending 200 pages with the narrator i don't feel like i have any sense of who he is and why he did what he did i was hoping to wake up this morning and feel like the book had become a 4 star read for me after a little time away from it but that's not the case i may revisit it at some point with lowered expectations i think i'd enjoy it much more","380":"wow i expected a book by john darnielle who i consider to be one of if not the best living songwriters to be great but this was great difficult to read and one that i definitely physically felt as i worked through it but so well crafted","381":" 3 5 stars this was an interesting book and it leaves you with a lot of things to discuss think about it's also hard to describe to someone who hasn't read it on its surface it's about a man who after a disfiguring accident in his teens imagines and creates a mail correspondence sci fi game that becomes fairly successful there isn't a whole lot of plot beyond that the book is more about feelings of isolation and depression and about the different paths your life can take depending on your choices darnielle is a great writer and his writing style and structure add a lot of depth to the book the title refers to the idea that if you play certain rock records backward you can hear hidden usually satanic messages darnielle echoes that with the structure of the book i won't give too much away but it's intriguing that if you were to read the book backward the tone at the end would be very different than if you read it normally the book is quite short around 200 pages and i did find myself wanting a bit more but i found it to be an interesting and quick read and can recognize its ingenuity so i think it's worth a read","382":" ever since a disfiguring accident at the age of 17 sean phillips has retreated into his own isolated world as a means of escape and to a lesser extent an income sean creates a text based role playing game called trace italian the game is handwritten by sean and sent out in the mail players write to him with their moves and he mails them back with the results of their action in this way games can stretch on nearly infinitely sean loves his game and loves the players though he's careful to always stay in his role of game maker all goes well enough until a pair of teenagers begin to take his game too seriously leading to devastating consequences as sean is now forced to face law enforcement officials regarding his role in the tragic incident he turns within and ponders the circumstances surrounding his own accident and the subsequent creation of his game wolf in white van is one of those books that i really wanted to love i adore darnielle's work in his band the mountain goats and i consider him to be one of the greatest lyricists on the contemporary indie scene this book was also a national book award finalist and an alex award book so i figured it must be absolutely amazing in the end i couldn't help but feel like it was pretentious i completely failed to connect with sean as a character and the descriptions of the game while certainly unique didn't do much for me i can't determine whether my lukewarm feelings towards this novel were due more to my high expectations or whether this just wasn't the book for me i'm generally unfamiliar with the concept of gaming via mail and personally acknowledge that i would never ever have the patience to keep playing but the high point of the storyline for me anyway involved reading about the players themselves the book is definitely well written but it feels slow and deliberate much like the game play of trace italian not a book for everyone but there are clearly many readers out there who have a lot of love for this so there's absolutely some merit here i didn't hate it but i didn't love it either i guess i'll just be sticking with darnielle's music","383":"3 3 5 stars i'm really torn because this was really interesting parts of it were beautifully written and i haven't really read anything like it that i can easily recall but there's just something missing for me like it left me unsatisfied and not quite connected with sean the main character i didn't much like being in his head either it's quite short so maybe this played into why i couldn't connect or why i felt not wholly involved with the events but i have to say john darnielle doesn't waste words some of the prose is spare but precise and poetic","384":"my knee jerk reaction would be to slap one star on wolf in white van move on and be done with it i just could not see the point author john darnielle brainchild frontman of alt folk stars the mountain goats was making with this novel it made me angry it left me confused and depressed it gave precious few clues why protagonist sean debilitated by a disfiguring injury at age 17 and loses himself in creating fantasy role playing games does what he does thinks what he thinks i suppose this was darnielle's intention but i can't applaud the effort i suppose though there's some value to use this novel as a jumping off point for discussions on why some adolescents or adults for that matter are so emotionally morally bankrupt that they see no repercussions in acting out in destructive ways other than that though i just can't fathom any other reason to read this","385":"maybe i was not 100% focused while reading the book but i sure didn't get the point the protagonist has created a turn based game that players play via mail two players get into it and one dies the protagonist has some horrific facial injury that isn't explained until the last page but it cause of the injury was hardly a surprise if these two story parts had some connection it was lost to me","386":"wolf in white van is an extremely powerful read intricately constructed it draws you in and captivates from page one to the final words darnielle pairs beautiful prose with gripping character depiction making his readers reckon with their own conceptions of the boundaries between real and imagined isolation and human connection this book resonated so deeply with me as if it were a shout into the void waiting to be heard","387":"i really wanted to like this but it just didn't amount to much left too many unanswered questions","388":"holy cow loved it wished i could have devoured it in one sitting i don't want to say too much except that the writing was lovely and i highly recommend this book","389":" god i fucking loved this book darnielle knows how to make your skin prickle just with a stray turn of phrase or little dark ideas that creep in through your peripherals the book's subject matter is not cheery of course but reading this book feels like slowly being strangled by some massive unknowable force and it's almost entirely because of how it's written and how slowly but casually darnielle offers the story's and the main character's dark psychology's details to you i loved that the book is littered with 80s 90s ephemera too there are names you'll recognize red sonja krull but it never feels like nerdpandering everyone read this book it's not even very long oh and then listen to everything the mountain goats ever put out","390":"i don't often write reviews or much less even read but i suppose those are two things i am looking to actively change in my head i can think of the criticisms of this book a plot which seems to go nowhere and lacks a conclusion and a feeling of detachment from it's protagonist and yet ultimately i feel as if that helped achieve what truly made this book enjoyable for me and understanding of it's main character sean a young man who is as detached from life as you feel detached to him i think ultimately what made this book a success to me was the feeling it evoked a familiar feeling but one which is hard to place in words the feeling you experience when you look at life and simply observe it and it's many paths the feeling when you look at it's many paths and wonder if there is something more to it perhaps some secret to it if you merely looked closer or were merely able to connect the dots that were in front of you in creating that feeling or at least making me recognize it i was able to relate to the character and the world he created to someone who reads far more often that i do this might not be enough to justify what others will see as faults in this book but ultimately that feeling what drew me into the book and was able to make the experience truly memorable for me in a way that few books do","391":" i guess my only focused complaint is that the book is a good bit too small for such a giant subject still it manages quite well with the little bit of room it takes up with much in the way of subtext and gentle but effective prodding of big important topics like mental instability and that way a small thing can feel like some overwhelming everything in its peak and for some their last moment especially when you're young and lacking in some much needed perspective it kept reminding me of that line from the virgin suicides where the doctor questions the first suicide attempter's suicide attempt the one with the celeste y name yes i'm being lazy with something to the tune of you're not even old enough to know how bad life gets this is sort of similar in tone in many ways but like the nerdy first person version i appreciated that angle of the adult working backwards reflecting on feeling incapable of connection and retreating into a fantasy world in order to cope with varying degrees of harsh realities i especially liked all the parts in the scorched earth style game world and wish there had been more of them and to state the obvious there would have been in a longer book i never got into the roleplaying thing and gave my brother a hearty amount of shit for it over the years but i can see a little better now how it could be a useful means of compartmentalizing and coping with feelings of otherness and social awkwardness powerlessness in the face of things like poverty and puberty and parental units being a kid blah blah wait maybe that sounds snotty and condescending i don't mean it that way i mean like me with headphones escaping into music or compulsively reading except a more complicated and less isolating version with more dice and more time at denny's this is a really strong albeit brief first novel from a fairly famous guy who probably didn't even need to write anything in the first place in order to make that dollar so i encourage everyone to read it and love it and praise it on the internet so he will write a longer and more complex work that will really really shine all the ingredients are here i just wish more time would've been spent explaining the relationship of the narrator with his ladygal she felt a little bit tacked on that i could've known more about the two kids who met tragedy as a result of the game and that i understood the familial and schoolyard dynamics better we were getting there and then the book ended write a biggin' dude don't be coy last thing i notice a lot of people have shelved this book as young adult it made me start to wonder if i have some misconceptions about what the genre entails do we call something young adult just for having non adults in some parts of it even though the narrator is an adult and the subject matter is ummm very very grim does that mean wuthering heights is ya great expectations the friday the 13th flicks and almost every horror franchise ever infinite jest it i'm confused it's been about a decade since i worked in a book store but if i were just thrown back on the floor with a cart of books right now i thiiiinnk i would probably shelve this under fiction lit d seriously i'm just wondering where the line is drawn please to discuss","392":"quietly powerful almost frustratingly ambiguous and enigmatic does a good job at capturing and depicting those beautifully mysterious moments and places we all experience","393":"i liked it though i don't think i got as much out of it as many of the readers without ruining anything the story is told non sequentially mostly in the aftermath of the protagonists worst acts the final is the telling of that action and it left me lukewarm but it was still a pretty good story","394":"a dark subject brilliantly done","395":"i love a lot of things about this book and i found it extremely engaging but occasionally darnielle's writing comes off a little flat it does make me feel as though he could write something pretty powerful in the future i dug the atmosphere of the book a lot particularly the final harrowing moments that offer an insightful look at the paradoxical desire for obliteration in the face of a world of possibilities","396":" just an incredible read i feel like there's a spectrum that runs between \"highly readable\" and \"memorable prose \" but this book blew that dichotomy apart for me--i found myself flying through the pages wanting to read more while trying to slow myself down to appreciate the beautiful construction of each paragraph my only complaint is that i wish it were longer much much longer because its strength lies in the way it inhabits its world so thoroughly i've read complaints that the ending is unsatisfying and counterpoints about how that's an intentional choice and i agree with both sides really--i think it's an unfortunate truth that the \"perfect\" form of this story is capped by an imperfect ending but that doesn't diminish the outstanding journey that leads to it","397":"loved it so frustrating yet beautiful i was instantly engaged and enjoyed the entire story the entire time i was reading it my brain kept asking but why i love that you are forced to accept that as much as you'd like one the answer is never that simple","398":" i only rate books i finish reading and i only keep reading a book if i'm interested in it and i like it so my rating system is skewed upward with 1 i liked it and 5 best thing ever i read this book because i really like the mountain goats this book was a little like the mountain goats but not really i'll start by saying that i did not know what this book was about when i started reading and i had no knowledge of the true life events that probably inspired the book james vance and raymond belknap in nevada hat tip to this book review for that info full stop review of wolf in white van by sam costello i like that the book meanders i like the language most of the time and the descriptions i like that it skips around chronologically i like that it doesn't try to explain human behavior i read some goodreads reviews where people rated this book poorly because it was boring or didn't have any clear outcomes or didn't explain things that were going on i wasn't frustrated by this but i can see how others could be with all that i liked about the book it's hard to pin down why the book didn't really fully work for me i think one thing was the basic overall structure i've avoiding talking about plot content purposefully because i think it's a better read to not know anything about it but the structure to me was this major event happened and it changed people's lives so this book encircles that event for the entire length of the book until it builds up to the final scene which is that event i'm not a big fan of this kind of structuring generally because it feels like artificial motivation if the whole book is obsessed with this one event and leaking out information about it slowly over time i can assume that the ending will reveal something about the event the natural anticipation here as a reader is that the author will lay out the event and explain why it happened so some people were upset that this did not happen i wasn't upset about that really moreso that the book as a whole was driving towards this event that i had a feeling would not be fully explained so what's the point of the drive only after reading a few reviews did i come to think that the book is purposefully throwing up smokescreens to break down any momentum it has in revealing what is going on there are some definite knowns in the book but i think the unknowns outweigh the knowns it's almost a bit like the crying of lot 49 in that there is a cloud of information and it's hard to tell what is relevant or if anything matters but wolf in white van is not nearly as obtuse as pynchon was then i started thinking that it might be a bit like the big lebowski in that the first time anyone watches that movie they're a little disappointed because it doesn't seem to have a coherent plot or a fulfilling resolution then upon rewatching the movie it starts to reveal all its charms i don't have the desire to re read wolf in white van at the moment so i won't be able to tell if i'd appreciate it more knowing what happens throughout the whole book overall darnielle is pretty good with language on the page though it's different from his lyrics mostly due to the nature of fiction v lyrics in general and i think his lyrics triumph over his fiction here but that's just me and he captures some interesting feelings and events and observations across these pages i just didn't feel super engrossed in it and wasn't persuaded to live in this fictional world i do think that darnielle avoided taking several easy ways out with this story by not directly explaining events and behaviors he makes it all kind of a thought experiment about the nature of life and human interactions but something about it just didn't hold it together for me","399":" i really liked this book listening to the mountain goats while reading this book just added another level i 'discovered' them after starting the book and didn't get the connection until i looked up the band to see if they were touring there is some thing about this book that reminds me of ready player one but it is much darker i had a sense of disappointment when i finished which is always a sign of a good book the timeline in the book is not straightforward but i found it relatively easy to follow once i realized this would not be a linear book i highly recommend","400":" so as a lyricist i think darnielle is at his best as an empathetic and evocative chronicler of teenage angst gone horribly even dangerously awry and that this is even more true when he's writing about the ways in which our adolescent selves continue to shape our adult lives in profound ways there is a lot of this in wolf in white van as well bored uncool kids searching for some kind of purpose but darnielle is ultimately more of a portraitist than a narrative artist in song format this often works beautifully one listens to his songs and gets a sense of a character that's all the more poignant because it's over in two and a half minutes as a novel however beautifully and evocatively written it feels a little thin i wanted more breadth a sense of the characters in motion or depth a sense of the interior lives of several minor characters in particular","401":"after just having finished this book i tried to come up with the words to describe it and just cannot put them together sitting and reading this is as close to a profound experience as i've had reading a book it faces the questions of depression loneliness and isolation in people like no other book i've come across i cannot possibly recommend this book enough to anyone that will listen","402":"i don't know if i would recommend this very unexpected story written by the primary member of the band mountain goat the story centers around a young man who has disfigured himself in an accident and mostly one is in his head as he shares his observations and experiences some of the descriptions are so beautiful while others made me uncomfortable i am glad i tackled this book","403":"i wish there was more u0026amp i'd love to see more of the game and maybe other players","404":"beautifully written about a mans life after an accident leaves him disfigured he creates a game","405":"this is not my typical kind of book but it was recommended to me so i thought i would give it a try i loved memento but this story going backwards confused me the only reason i read to the very end is because i wanted to know what happened to his face which was a let down i think i just didn't get it i would love to have someone explain it to me because i wanted to like this story and trace italian sounded so cool but even those parts i didn't understand and why isn't there a the in the title even the section that the title is taken from says a wolf in the white van","406":"for the first chapter or so of the book i had a tough time not hearing john darnielle's voice speaking the lines of the first person narration but eventually the prose overcame my preconceptions and a compelling story emerged the narrative kind of petered out in the final third of the book however and so despite the beautifully crafted words i was left empty still i would love to see what the mountain goats frontman does to follow up this debut","407":"this book was awesome darnielle has a way with words both in his lyrics and turns out his prose the whole book has wonderful descriptions and metaphors the likes of which you don't usually see in today's fiction the story itself is at times chilling and at times intriguing it's very short which actually might be my only complaint but it's almost like a series of snapshots of someone's life someone who clearly thinks differently from the rest of us and who has a simply fascinating view on life it's a stellar book not for everyone but i liked it a lot","408":" i craned my great head and saw all that yellow brown plastic catch the light little pills glinting like ammunition and then my brain went to work juggling and generating several internal voices at once someone's filming this this isn't real whoever sean is it's not who i think he is all the details i think i know about things are lies somebody is trying to see what i'll do when i run across these bottles this is a test but there won't be any grade later the tape is rolling but i'm never going to see the tape it is a terrible thing to feel trapped within a movie whose plot twists are senseless this is why people cry at the movies because everybody's doomed no one in a movie can help themselves in any way their fate has already staked its claim on them from the moment they appear onscreen just like the characters in a movie you can see the long slow arc of sean phillips' doom approaching except can it really be his doom if he lives through it does he live through it is it really possible to see something coming if all you see is the wreckage it leaves if nothing else and there is a lot else here you have to respect darnielle's skill at creating such a sense of dread about something that happened before almost everything else something we know everything we need to know about long before it 'happens' in the course of the book wolf in white van crawls so thoroughly inside the head and heart of our narrator that even though we never find out the answers to many of the more obvious questions because sean doesn't know the answers because there aren't answers because nobody ever actually manages to find the inside of the trace italian you can feel the truth of what's happening down in your bones and blood and it's not a happy truth but they don't all have to be while i am a fan of darnielle's work as the mountain goats and there's some overlap in subject matter and empathy i really think his writing style and approach is very different here he fully realizes that his canvas is both bigger and differently shaped than an album and uses that to its fullest effect wolf in white van is a slim quick read two commutes for me but the lasting emotional impact is more profound than many more overtly impressive books comparing albums and novels is impossible but in some ways this is even more impressive than his songs it certainly left more bruises this is a beautiful bleak compassionate wrenching terrifying loving book it is at once an exacting portrait of a person who is very different from most of the people who will read about him and a statement about some things fundamental to the human condition its world feels real sometimes terribly so i really really hope john darnielle keeps writing novels it's really just simple math the whole of it there are only two stories either you go forward or you die but it's very hard to die because all the turns pointing that way open up onto news ones and you have to make the wrong choice enough times to really mean it you have to stay focused","409":"this is a beautifully written book that nonetheless took a few chapters to really grab my attention it is highly personal and somewhat lonely and ended in a way that made sense but still left me emotionally hollow i'm glad i read it but it was certainly a melancholic experience","410":"if you write a book the way you write a song then you run the risk of creating something original evocative poetic disturbing even that also has the power to alienate the reader who seeks in a novel something entirely different from a song","411":"beautiful writing i have a lot of feelings","412":"engagingly written","413":"i'm a huge fan of the author's band the mountain goats so i'm somewhat biased here but i definitely came in with some skepticism that he could write a novel so maybe on balance my view is objective anyway this is my favorite new book i read this year and i highly recommend it","414":" i asked for this book for christmas because i heard an interview with the author on national public radio and i was intrigued the interviewer seemed really struck by the story and the book reviews were very complimentary i on the other hand kept reading it not because it was irresistible it was easy to put down mid sentence but because i was sure at some point the magic would happen and i would care about the character the magic remained elusive and the only reason i finished this book was because it was so short and i remained hopeful that the book and the time i spent reading it would be redeemed by the ending it was not","415":"the concept of this book was very intriguing a disfigured and alienated man coming to terms with his decisions and the paradoxically destructive and reviving nature of the mind it was quietly devastating and sparse a vignette on isolation and redemption","416":" i think it's human nature to want to identify with a story teller they're sharing an experience with you and you want to see it from their point of view that's part of the fun to step outside yourself and see things a different way but as much as i wanted to i just couldn't identify with sean the protagonist of wolf in white van i don't think even sean could identify with himself \"it isn't really a mystery this occasional need i feel to comfort my father he says at one point i'd done something terrible to his son once \"indeed sean's inner workings - his motives his goals his dreams his fears - are virtually impossible to reach it's as if they're locked deep within a fortress in a distant wasteland guarded by warlords and radioactive fallout just trying to access that fortress is a hazard in and of itself - hazard upon hazard upon hazard just like trace italian trace italian is a game sean invented it's a fictional fortress located in kansas the last remaining refuge in a world ravaged by nuclear war the objective is to simply get there to penetrate the citadel and take refuge in its inner sanctum sean is something like the dungeon master in dungeons u0026amp dragons he sets players on a path and sends them four options by mail the players respond with their move and sean sends back the consequences of that move along with four more options and so the game goes on until the player gives up no one ever reaches the trace italian and rarely do they die they simply wander through its labrynthian coil a spiral that never reaches its center there's a fortune teller that might have been able to help you at one point but he's dead now the best you can do is rummage through his remains collecting vague artifacts and unwittingly pick up the key to a door you'll never find you can spend countless hours days or even years trying to get there it but it's virtually guaranteed that you won't it's an indecipherable code like the book's name that is the book title is a reference to a song by larry norman when you play the song backwards it's supposed to say \"wolf in white van \"a guest on the 700 club might say this is a satanic message but really it's a phrase that raises more questions than answers \"is the wolf in back of the van is it driving why no article \"the\" or \"a and that brings us back to sean's narrative it's well told but ultimately enigmatic sean doesn't know why he does the things that he does and you won't either that's not really the point like fighting your way to the trace it's more about the journey itself","417":"intense and really smart","418":"i have mixed feelings about this book part of me loved it and part of me got so frustrated by it it could be 3 5 i listened on audiobook the author was the narrator if you're a super fan of the author this might be cool but it took a while to be able to listen to him reading without cringing however his voice became appropriate for the character this was a great new original voice in literature there were times when the lists of the game were too much i get it i think he harmed the story by not making the book longer and going more into depth did i just say i wanted a book longer not much just 100 pages to wrap up the story line on the game players i think i was so sucked in because the protagonist reminded me of people i knew in high school the ending was just an ending there was no sense of a build up to that exact ending leaving me to feel a little let down i think you sense my conflicted feelings i did listen straight through and was very interested the whole time","419":" \"wolf in white van\" is the perfect book for those of us who found \"memento\" a little too straightforward you're looking for something new to read when \"wolf in white van\" presents itself there's a maze on the cover and the book doesn't look too thick you recognize the author's name john darnielle as the singer songwriter behind indie rock band the mountain goats do you pick up the book and read it or turn away and run while recuperating from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head 17 year old metal listening conan the barbarian loving sean phillips had the idea for role playing game \"trace italian \" a play by mail game that eventually spawned a small but dedicated fan base as a player you're given a new scenario and a choice to make with each letter with the ultimate goal of traversing a post apocalyptic united states and locating the game's titular fort only sean never intends for anyone's game to end death and victory mean the same thing - your game is over sean renders your choices moot as you encircle the game's comfortable middle i don't believe in happy endings or even in endings at all but i am as susceptible to moments of indulgent fantasy as anybody else the middle is also where darnielle places us in sean's story though \"comfortable\" is far from its best descriptor \"trace italian\" is jeopardized when two players attempt to act out the game in real life resulting in death the game was supposed to be something sean had full control of unlike his own life where choices left him disfigured and alone wolf in white van is a journey through sean's maze of a mind to see what choices ultimately lead to his injury the story's unconventional structure using its labyrinth of a timeline to create connections between points in sean's life would be complicated to pull off even for a seasoned novelist the fact that it's a fiction debut for darnielle makes it even more impressive that he pulls off this idea but like the book says \"there is something fierce and starved about first ideas \" kit twitter | tumblr","420":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here a very strong debut novel by john darnielle a very realistic look at the struggles that come with alienation and loneliness during the teenage years the story follows a young man who survived a suicide attempt and as a result literally blew his face off","421":"first thing i would like to say that if you are picking it up after you ready ready player one it's not going to be that similar yes there is some gaming involved but it's very different and it's not the main part of the novel just a sidequest see what i did there this is a very difficult book to rate and review i am somewhere between two and three stars and this may well change in the future the ending is what completely threw me off and reduced the original rating from four the book lost most of its steam around 60% in and careened more or less into madness almost it's an interesting book for sure and probably worth reading just for experiencing something completely different i think it'll be a unique experience for most readers which makes it really universal still it was too ambiguous for me but if you don't have issues with that then go ahead and give this novel a go","422":" this is hard to review because i thought i was in for a story much different than what it turned out to be i was expecting more intrigue mystery and much bigger focus on the ill fated teenagers who played trace italian what it turned out to be was a slow paced highly descriptive study of loneliness life choices suicide and relationships it was interesting but i didn't love it or even like it i don't think i don't know how much of that is rooted in the fact that i was expecting something much different than i got i enjoyed learning about the world of trace italian and was most engaged in the book when it was entrenched in that part of sean's life and i'll admit it felt very unlike anything i've ever read so worth a read if you are willing to delve into the worlds of rpgs suicidal thoughts and attempts and meditations on relationships between parents and children not worth a read if you are expecting the focus to be on the deaths the trial and the game creators motivations and involvement this is not the story of those events but the slow detailed and blurred story of what led to them","423":"this was a fantastic book i already knew darnielle could spin quite a yarn thanks to his entry in the 33 1 3 series but this was even more engrossing and engaging","424":"i'm not sure i have so many new things to say about this beautifully written hilarious tragic ass kicking genre churn novel but i will say to the hesitant detractors who say it ended disappointingly anticlimactically blah blah blah i think you completely missed the pacing of the novel from page 1 it was meant to end just about where it started thanks to podcast literary disco for reminding me to check out a novel i'd been delaying","425":"woah really amazing but not for the faint of heart","426":"this was an interesting book and this writer shows a ton of potential there we're some areas which were a little redundant and possibly unnecessary but this is definitely worth the read","427":"what a strange beautiful novel","428":"at the age of 17 sean phillips has a horrific disfiguring accident in an attempt to escape the pain of recovery he creates trace italian a mail in role play game where survival means victory but doing so is incredibly challenging the story of sean and his accident of his creation of this epic dystopian fantasy game and the lives of those involved is wonderful sean is difficult to look at and listen to so he spends his time behind his desk answering player's turns and connecting with some of them as the game spans through time lance and carrie are two such players but their decision to take the game of a savage future america into the the real world disaster strikes and sean must question his decisions the story unfolds in reverse and in flashbacks so the novel twists through present day back through various players and ends at sean's accident answering just as many questions as it poses the prose is beautiful the story fresh and interesting and the characters complex the story is captivating and mysterious the emotion is fresh and raw and i couldn't stop myself from continuing","429":"not sure how i felt about this book really was expecting something a lot different than what it ended up being the protagonist narrator sean is likable in his way but his thoughts and the overall details of the book are quite dark three stars for good structure variation and originality but would probably give 2 stars for the plot as a whole","430":" i really loved this first novel by john darnielle the nimble lyricist and creative force behind the band mountain goats or at least i know i will remember moments and scenes and the overall feel of wolf in white van for a long time but this is a emotionally brutal book with a world view that's more than a little disconcerting even straight up depressing though it's also pretty funny in parts and darnielle doesn't brood the pages fly by and so i'm not sure who i would recommend it to without them thinking especially after that final scene what the fuck why'd scott tell me to read this and there are certainly some large narrative holes which you could say was darnielle just being deliberately vague or cryptic but to me were simply unsatisfying but the core here told in the first person by our protagonist sean philips about how he got his severely disfigured face and how he lives with everything that's happened and the old school play by mail game called trace italian that he runs and his pre disfigurement childhood and youth and the why of it all this is smart gutty insightful stuff that earns our empathy and horror and even a bit of affection it earned mine anyway","431":"i am very conflicted about this book it is beautifully complex and requires a lot of thinking but it also very disturbing check out my full review http headfullofbooks blogspot com 2","432":" 4 5 easilyintensely sad and a powerful representation of the isolation many teens experience even when surrounded by loving family and friends the powerlessness experienced by both sean and his parents is aching the use of the game trace italian that sean creates is a wonderful device to explore the choices we all face every day this book is beautifully written but may not be everyone's cup of tea it is harshly real and for some readers this peeling back the layers to the emptiness and overwhelming pain sean describes may be too intense or conversely so outside their realm of experience that is can't be empathized with","433":"loved the voice in this from the first moment i am a mountain goats fan so i had high expectations for the writing and was not disappointed in retrospect i think the pace structure was a little flat there was no peak just a steady buildup of understanding but it didn't take away from the fact that i just really really liked reading this some moments of video game nerd culture might be awkward for some","434":"i'm not sure what all the fuss is about this book i found it be frustrating not enlightening and it took me forever to read","435":"i was really looking forward to reading this because i've been a fan of john darnielle's storytelling for a long time and the mountain goats' album tallahassee is on par with many great works of literature in my opinion i wasn't disappointed though the book was different than i was expecting it focuses on a couple narrow themes alienation isolation the infinite unknown choices we face in life but explores them deeply it challenges you by telling you the what and leaving you to fill in the blanks on the why i liked the reverse chronological structure it didn't feel gimmicky my only critique was that in some parts the prose is a bit too impenetrable but what can you expect from a folk rock lyricist","436":"this is an intense look at the power for good and bad of imagination darnielle uses his for good","437":"i have a feeling this is actually a five star book that i sort of ruined with interrupted reading and a short attention span","438":" i had a hard time writing this review for many reasons timing was both right and wrong reading the book was easy reading the book was pleasure and escape and i needed a lot of that lately trying to say something about it what it 'means' i wasn't sure sometimes if i'm feeling this way i'll look through some other reviews to get a discussion going in my mind some talking point gleaned from agreeing or disagreeing with some other person's review this time i couldn't do it long winded examinations referencing denny's and doctor who what does that have to do with anything i'm not clever when i read something that transports me i don't question it i was excited when i heard lines that reminded me of darnielle's songs i felt like this was the story behind some of the characters situations in his music but i didn't make assumptions based on gamer stereotypes after all do i fit in that category did sean no few people except those who really try can fit neatly into a labeled box i kept wishing as i read that i could send in my moves it was an interesting book in that way no one was striving for connections in the normal ways it wasn't a penpal service and sean tried to keep himself seperate from those who played his game of course no matter what we wonder who people are and we try to imagine why how who and all that i didn't have any questions at the end of the book would i like to read more yes of course i would but then again the thing lives on in my mind now too","439":" welp its not a bad book it is however confusing at times nonlinear jumping back and forth between past present and the narrators fictional world did i like it in a way yes would i read it again possibly not at least not for a while it's sad the story within it's been a few months since i've read this book and this book has come to mind at least once or twice a week since then this book exhausted me i finished it not wanting to really do anything afterwards it took me a few days to pick up another book every time i did i thought of this book it's a very sad story and it does jump back and forth between past present and the narrators fictional world but the story has no message no morals that i could ascertain it's just a look within the mind of a depressed individual view spoiler who survived an attack on himself hide spoiler my recommendation read it then think about it set time to think about it","440":"this is not a book i enjoyed reading the content is difficult but exceptionally well done","441":" this book is tremendously boring and difficult to read i don't understand the praise for it at all which makes me wonder about the authenticity of the comments since they've all somehow miraculously come before the publication of the novel i understand that review copies go out but i wonder if many of these reviewers aren't mistaking their love of john darnielle's beautiful songs with their opinion about his insipid confusing novel the characters lack depth and the setting is quizzically hard to place the sentences are occasionally quite lazy not sure what these other folks saw in this one","442":"this is so beautifully written really admirable prose it may be that my own professional life means i'm not the ideal reader as the content is not so unfamiliar or stunning as i gather it is for most readers however it was a convincing and powerful narrative and i plan to re read","443":"i enjoyed this more than i had anticipated i would at the halfway mark it played like a long dream sequence with the concrete facts of the story just out of reach but for once i was kind of into it i wish i knew if view spoiler sean ever reached out to chris i'm pretty darn sure he didn't get the reconstructive surgery though i also really really wish i knew why like why hide spoiler","444":" the subject matter of this book attracted me but i had trepidations about reading it predicting many pitfalls the author was unlikely to avoid i was worried especially there would be excesses of sentimentality nostalgia or wish fulfillment pleasently most were well avoided primarily because the book is kept short the tone is conversational which suits the material questions unfold rapidly and this propels the story along satisfyingly even if many questions remain at the end it was nice seeing a pbm game as an element in a story i wondered if they had been totally forgotten by now","445":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i read this in two sittings the way the story is told almost completely backwards in terms of chronology is very interesting if not quite suspenseful i found myself identifying with the main character sean in ways i was not entirely comfortable with the relationship he had with television the way the adults in his life concluded \"suicide pact\" and \"occultism\" rather than depression and alienation and his almost casual perusal of the history of his medicine cabinet especially struck a chor i read this in two sittings the way the story is told almost completely backwards in terms of chronology is very interesting if not quite suspenseful i found myself identifying with the main character sean in ways i was not entirely comfortable with the relationship he had with television the way the adults in his life concluded \"suicide pact\" and \"occultism\" rather than depression and alienation and his almost casual perusal of the history of his medicine cabinet especially struck a chord more","446":"#holidaybooktubeathon this was the second book i finished for the booktubeathon","447":" the story tells of sean's life in three disjointed narratives after the accident that destroys his face the time leading up to the accident when he was a teenager and inside the interactive fantasy game he creates as he is recovering which tragically destroys the lives of two teenage protagonists it's remarkable as the first person narrative seamlessly communicates sean's perspective as he deconstructs a world unwilling to look a disfigured person in the eyes even though the eyes are allegedly the windows to the soul he asks not for sympathy or empathy as he brutally yet naively exposes the hypocrisy of life which he thinks he can improve by re inventing as a game i think it's a story of alienation and the impossibility of finding truth in other people as we refuse to confront discomforting reality such honesty is disturbing and unsettling","448":"three stars is not a fair review for this book it should be four or even five it's brilliantly and beautifully written the plot is full of intrigue but is never overblown or melodramatic and yet i never connected with the book in the way i wanted to that's definitely a renee problem not a book problem so i guess disregard my rating","449":" a mesmerizing and incredibly contemporary book wolf in white vanu0026gt is something that should resonate particularly with xers and millennials who were all born into a world where television was not an invention but an element like nitrogen in the air where video games felt like the beginning of one thing and the beginning of the end of what came before sean who had severely disfigured himself in an accident the nature of which is withheld until the end is a deeply introspective person after all his disfigurement has barred him from living the normal life and so all he's left to do really is think about the one he'd made for himself this inner life feels fantastically authentic here is a character who has grown to understand himself in ways his younger self could never have dreamed here and there alone reflecting he tells us i'd bump up against what felt like a buffer zone between me and some vast reserve of grief but its reinforcements were sturdy enough and its construction solid enough to prevent me from really ever smelling its air feeling its wind on my face anyone who has suffered incredible loss can attest to the truth spoken in these words there's always a dissonance between what we feel and what we feel we ought to feel we all walk around this earth feeling that there is something about us that prevents our full access to it and in the case of sean this difference is made grotesquely explicit interestingly as self aware as sean is his worldview is still largely confined to the culture in which it had developed take for example the way in which he describes a moment in which he is unsure how to proceed \"in video games you sometimes run into what they call a side quest and if you don't manage to figure it out you can usually just go back into the normal world of the game and continue on toward your objective i felt like i couldn't find my way back to the world now like i was somebody locked in a meaningless side quest in a stuck screen \" the making sense of real life in terms of how video games work is something i find fascinating as someone who has grown up extensively playing video games much to my later regret i often find myself applying such vocabulary to my own life situations it feels backwards whenever i do it that the real world is like a video game but this is how my generation's brain has been shaped by video games it's why gamification is a thing in order to make real life tasks enjoyable we have to make them resemble video games as much as possible it's the way our brains were molded later in the book the narrator relates an anecdote \"once when my mom asked me why i liked to play video games i said it was because they were relaxing and she looked at me like i'd sprouted horns but xevious is a very relaxing game playing it was like watching flowers bloom that last line is crucial what could possibly be more different than watching flowers bloom than staring at digital information shining on an electric screen the blurring of the edges between what is real and what is escape from the real is the central question of this book where is the line between the two the very title we learn halfway through refers to the anxiety we have a society regarding escapism that it's somehow dangerous to what is in fact real that it corrupts our sense of it in a way it does after all real life has side quests now and w eird metal airplains flying over the green and grey background dropping boms on everything in the case of the video game xevious are like flowers blooming the way we make sense of the world has been corrupted but it's always been corrupted it's never been pure the same people worrying about the so called wolf in white van lyrics thought to be heard in a song if played backwards are the same people who think of everything in terms of jesus and satan the plot itself carries is like a meandering river it gets us to where we know it will eventually take us but it does so at its own pace taking side quests along the way at the heart of the story is a more immediate instance of the perils of escapism the lawsuit involving sean and a pair of teenagers whose involvement with sean's unique business a mail in kind of choose your own adventure game takes a tragic turn a strange very smart book that will linger in your brain and like all effective media might even change it","450":" my brother and mom both read this recently and raved about it so i stole it from them the last time i was home the author john darnielle is a member of the band the mountain goats our narrator sean lives in southern california at the age of 17 there was an incident which completely disfigured him to pull himself out of that darkness sean creates mail in role player games customers mail in their choices and sean responds with a new set of turns for them to take this goes over well and is even somewhat successful until two players take the game into their real lives and disaster strikes the book works so well less because of the plot although it is fascinating but because of the writing it's unlike any other style of writing i've read there were sentences and turns of phrase that i had to go back and read over and over again because they were so strangely beautiful","451":"do you know the mountain goats you know how their music is beautiful and bitter and leaves you kind of unsettled that's this book i want more of the story it definitely felt like there were loose ends all over the place and then it was over","452":"reading this book was painful it was disorienting difficult and unorganized while i felt empathetic and pitied the protagonist the book was a meandering labyrinth of his thoughts and the world that he created i know darnielle is considered to be a genius lyricist but i think maybe that's the medium he should stick to sorry","453":"a dark lyrical book that i wish i'd read with a friend so we could talk about what it means i loved the gaming premise though this is nothing like ready player one and the mystery elements i was surprised and a little let down by the ending but i so enjoyed the atmosphere and i got lost in the world the author created so i can't complain too much","454":"fans of turn based games and those interested in seeing through the eyes of a loner will get something out of this book it was a tour de force and one i'd read again","455":" this book claws open your chest and starts squeezing at your heart almost immediately and doesn't let up i didn't know what to expect when i started reading it it was just one of those books that i'd heard good things about several hours later i was done and went back and re read some of the passages that really got to me it's not pretty it's not happy but it's one of the best books i've read this year the protagonist sean is the creator of a post apocalyptic survival game called trace italian even though we're in present day for most of the novel the game is still played via regular mail by the players sending in their moves and questions to sean and having him send back the next turns and challenges to them the way you play trace italian seems almost unbearably quaint from a modern perspective and people usually don't believe me when i tell them it's how i supplement my monthly insurance checks but people underestimate just how starved everybody is for some magic pathway back into childhood when two teenagers take it too seriously and one of them dies sean finds he must defend himself against charges brought on by their angry baffled parents sean can imagine how they feel having angered and baffled his own parents when he was a teenager and had an incident with a shotgun the story is told out of sequence in bits and pieces from the perspective of a lonely man a frightening looking creature with a reconstructed face sequestered in his own world creating a game about survival and moving forward my imagination built a pretty complete picture of the extent of the damage done to sean's head and face again in bits and pieces like a puzzle from the way he has to cut up everything and eat it with a knife and fork to the horror show of his smile to how his hearing is permanently affected people do look at my face quite often but usually only if they can convince themselves that i won't notice they're looking they try not to let their eyes stop wandering when they look over in my direction they pose as if they were surveying some broader scene i understand a little the social dictate to not stare at misshapen people you want to spare their feelings you don't want them to feel ugly i love that line he's denied normal jobs dating grocery shopping and even his grandmother's funeral all because of his face whether he's denying himself the activity or others are the reason is because he makes people uncomfortable his isolation drove him deep into his imagination and it was something that made him feel good and powerful and in control of a whole fantastic albeit post apocalyptic world until those kids took the game too far and met their deaths in the real world it ends at the beginning which feels just right you know sean's whole story now and know he'll probably continue to go on and do ok which is all he and his parents wanted read this wonderful book now and i would highly recommend it to teenagers much like the burn journals by brent runyon this is a story of pain and redemption and finding your true self inside","456":" john darnielle is of course best known for his band the mountain goats which is not so much a band as him and whoever happens to be playing with him at that particular time this made me a bit suspicious of his bona fides as a writer but wolf in white van is actually quite well written as a writer darnielle is as one might have expected really still more of a song lyricist albeit a highly literary one than a novelist situation and atmosphere are generally well done and the narrator who is also the central character is well drawn on the other hand plot is largely dispensed with the novel is really more like a series of very closely related vignettes and we never really get to know the other characters who generally appear only briefly anyway however by keeping the focus tightly on the main character first person narration is very helpful in this regard throughout darnielle ensures that you don't see any of these potential issues as shortcomings the novel itself is largely based around the kind of teenage anomie that you can find in many mountain goats songs e g on the sunset tree though largely as seen from a considerable distance in time and or space the book is constructed around two incidents in which bored and disaffected teenagers estranged from their parents and the mainstream of society in their small towns do stupid things a logical theme for darnielle who based on his songs was once such a bored disaffected and estranged teenager himself while it's dangerous to take autobiographical criticism too far it's worth noting that both the narrator and darnielle grow up in small towns in southern california given that the narrator is significantly disfigured for reasons that i won't mention as it's an extremely mild spoiler there's not enough plot to support a significant spoiler it's easy to imagine the whole thing breaking down if the narrator's voice isn't done right but darnielle does a good job of conveying a kind of calm resignation that fits well with the character as a big mountain goats fan i would probably have preferred another album but if darnielle keeps writing novels i will keep reading them","457":" it seems churlish to ding a good book for not being a great one so let's just say this is a good book at times a _very_ good book and i enjoyed reading it well technically i enjoyed listening to it the audiobook is narrated by the author and it's fantastic that said it's good because the prose is excellent and darnielle's decision to tell the story in reverse is at once a surprisingly effective way to build narrative suspense and also impressively character appropriate the descriptions of trace italian the mail text adventure game that the narrator runs are both melancholy and intriguing while the story's events make it clear that this isn't really something well adjusted happy people like to play it's hard not to want to take part regardless of the consequences and darnielle does a good job making sure the narrative stays clear even with the backwards chronology i was never lost even though the narrator never comes out and says okay let's go back to yesterday that said there's a fundamental thinness to the novel that holds it back a little for me the writing is evocative and rich you could pick this book up and flip to any random page and find at least one sentence that hangs in your mind for days after but that richness in time starts to feel like a distraction the ultimate story while heartbreaking is barely a novel and the backwards framing in addition to being effective also manages to make all of this feel more in depth than it actually is this would be a harsher criticism if i wasn't fairly certain that this is exactly the sort of novel darnielle intended to write and given how many smart people i know who absolutely adored the book i'm willing to accept i'm being overly harsh and again it's really good just limited in a way i'm not sure you can fix","458":"this was much better than i thought it would be but nowhere near as good as the reviews made it sound that's about all i have to say about it","459":" this book is really better than i'm giving it credit for darnielle gives his protagonist a unique voice and it's an intriguing concept the character's motives are so vague and subjective though that it's hard for me to fully appreciate that's more my failing than darnielle's to get excited about a book i usually need a clear cut plot for that reason i enjoyed the movie memento much more than wolf in white van i'm still puzzled about the title although they share a few key similarities much of the story is told in reverse as sean reminisces about the events that led him to his reclusive life and the climax reveals the circumstances of his life changing injury at age 17 i'm looking forward to discussing this in my book club if only to hear everyone else's theories about sean's sanity and the forces that drove him to his fate he is fairly lost in the fantasy worlds he reads about and creates which makes him somewhat indifferent to the real world and unable to identify with certain emotions in others i got the feeling that he's somewhere on the autism spectrum although this is never stated very well written and every page is interesting but a bit frustrating if you're looking for a straight forward tale","460":"this was a strange book i think i was hoping for more but it didn't quite deliver at least it was something very different which i like","461":"i'd never heard of john darnielle and don't know his band but as i read this strange little disjointed book i knew from his cultural references that we grew up in a similar time according to his wiki page he's six months younger than i am the book about a disfigured recluse who's created a role playing game started out so odd the author relishes giving readers little sips of information and i spent the first half or so scratching my head wondering what was going on and where it was going but then he hooked me with a shared reference that immediately transported me back to 6th grade the narrator is in his room listening to a charismatic christian radio station the tbn network and they are talking about hidden messages devil messages that can be heard on rock songs if you play them backwards wow if you were in middle school in the 70s you know all about that it got the attention of parents and school administrators the way bullying does today i won't divulge what is said during the conversation but a clue is given away during the radio call that helps explain some of the mysteries of the mind of the narrator i'm not convinced the book fully works but it's evident that darnielle has a unique voice and tells a story that is all his own","462":"i really wanted to like this considering i'm a fan of the mountain goats and i like darnielle in general but this book felt like a chore to get through the writing is unique even lyrical at times but the story just didn't interest me and i felt intensely disconnected from the protagonist meh","463":"what an incredible book about anarchy entropy evil i'm not sure but it definitely left an impression the prose in this book is so wonderfully sharp and vivid i found myself constantly wanting to write down phrases because of how they felt and sounded unlike anything i've ever read before and a book that will stay with me for a long time to come","464":"this is one of those that will be with you always","465":"wolf in white van is an extremely difficult book to review the story is fairly straightforward sean a young man who suffered a disfiguring accident as a teenager creates a dungeon u0026amp dragons style text based rpg game that's played through the mail and causes a pair of impressionable players to experience their own tragedy however the book is so much more than just those plot points john darnielle lead singer and lyricist of the hyper literate band the mountain goats has crafted a tale that is as beautifully sad as it is inscrutable wolf in white van is only 207 pages but it feels significantly longer partly because darnielle tackles such weighty topics in the book but also because his language is so poetic and affecting i found myself rereading many passages there were more than a few parts however that were so opaquely composed that i reread them more for clarity than appreciation told mostly in reverse sequence the scenes are hypnotic full of gorgeous metaphors and abrupt endings it's an intricate sometimes frustrating puzzle of a novel but at no point was i left feeling unengaged this book is as close to a dream with its own logic and unsettling tone as i've ever read i'd have a hard time explaining wolf in white van to someone but i'd still recommend it to them the novel came just shy of a five star rating for me because of its challenging though mesmerizing prose but i feel like any changes to the book would've taken away its unique charms i've never read anything like wolf in white van before which is exactly as i suspect john darnielle intended","466":"i just didn't feel anything i finished it just for the sake of finishing it but i'll forget it soon enough","467":"a lot of people i know loved this book and it was definitely interesting but it didn't live up to the hype plus i keep getting john darnielle mixed up in my head with john roderick that didn't really affect my reading experience but i kept thinking of john roderick's podcast and hearing the book in his voice","468":"well i guess i would say i liked it but didn't love it i've been a fan of the mountain goats for awhile hence a fan of john darnielle whether you enjoy the book will have a lot to do with whether you like the style which jumps around in time both prior to and subsequent to a horrific accident that radically altered the protagonists life the book ends as those threads converge at the moment the accident takes place with as much time as he spends setting it up the ending seems disjointed and not fully formed without revealing too much the circumstances surrounding the accident don't make a lot of sense the game he developed post accident from which he derives his livelihood is interesting to watch play out but it's affect on those who play it could have been better fleshed out as well so as i said liked not loved","469":" john darnielle's band the mountain goats is one of my favorite bands and i wanted this to be a five star book so badly the writing is solid and the book is structurally and conceptually interesting but the whole thing just didn't come together for me in a particularly satisfying way the title wolf in white van is a reference to backmasking in rock records specifically the evangelical christian scaremongering that if you played seemingly benign records backwards you'd hear all kinds of satanic messages the book is structured in a way that turns that concept on its head read front to back the book starts in the present and moves slowly back in time toward a very grim final scene but taken chronologically from the last chapter to the first the book grows increasingly more positive and ends on a note of overwhelming joy what i'm not sure about though is whether we are reading the backmasked version of a normal novel the strange stuttering dark sounds hidden behind the everyday or whether darnielle is asking us to take his novel and play it backwards to find the joy hidden behind the suffering i guess it's meant to be some of both the story is very similar to darnielle's novella master of reality in that the main character of each is a metal loving social misfit who we know has been hospitalized for some deep psychological issues but we largely see the positive human side of the character and only gloss over the history that landed each in his present situation however while this worked well in master of reality's shorter format it felt shallow in wolf in white van where you have the length of an entire novel to contend with a narrator who is deliberately telling you only part of the story sketching things out just enough to give you an idea of what happened without really letting you get very far inside his head sean the narrator of wolf in white van spent many years telling himself stories about an invented post apocalyptic fantasy world and after being released from the hospital he decides to turn this world into a role playing game called trace italian which is played through the postal mail participants all start with the same initial story and series of choices mail in their turn and are rewarded with a page or two of descriptions about the next chapter in their story and another set of choices about what they could do next a sprawling slowed down choose your own adventure played out over months or years specifically designed so the player will explore forever without ever reaching the end as the book progresses we learn about some of the people who play trace italian in spite of having never met them sean obviously feels very close to them and thinks about them often we know that a team of two players began taking the game far too seriously resulting in the death of one and serious physical harm to the other but even though sean must have learned quite a lot about them in the ensuing legal battle one of the more frustrating parts of the book for me is that we don't get as much of lance and carrie's story as i would have liked the whole idea of trace italian is fascinating and one of the strongest parts of the book and i wish we could have spent more time learning about that world and the players who were drawn to it especially to understand what was so compelling about this story that two teenagers decided to risk their lives trying to turn it into a real world quest there are so many things about wolf in white van that are really good and a lot of clever things going on in the book but by the time i reached the end the darkest scene in the book though also not the surprise it's set up to be since you pretty well know what's going to happen from all the references to it along the way i was mostly just glad it was over the book covers a lot of surface but didn't give me the depth i wanted as a concept it's fantastic but it wasn't the five star book i was hoping for","470":"the writing was solid and the premise was interesting it just didn't hold out over a full 200 pages i either needed a more compelling narrator or insight into the minds of other characters to sustain interest","471":"very interesting and deep concept but i don't know exactly why i just couldn't really get into the story i didn't find myself invested at all the writing was actually very good but i think the characterisation lacked the narration in some parts was too convoluted and i got lost in it all in all it is a good book but not as great as the concept would suggest","472":"i haven't yet formulated what i think about this one it's certainly well written but i don't know how much i enjoyed it that's not a requirement for me per se but it does complicate coming up with an overall opinion","473":"a genuinely intense read for the nerd you have a deep look into the mind that enjoys weaving and playing a game why an individual might become so obsessed how it might feel to be so obsessed what it might mean for the psychological horror inclined you've got a twisted mind slowly roasting on its own flame pit of self judgement tight rope walking to stay capable of existing in society for the writer you have a sharply structured and executed narrative from a wobbly narrator you never quite trust there's even a little nostalgia in there for those of us raised in the 80s on heavy metal i can't remember the last time i thought of hit parader and circus and sci fi fantasy tales it gets more and more intense and more and more sad you never know quite which way it'll go i couldn't help but hope the whole time that things would become clear for me as the reader and better for the narrator not unlike life","474":"more than anything after reading this novel i wanted to play trace italian i wanted to write my own version of it i wanted to get lost in something that distracted me from the daily dirge of modern existence i am tired of facebook i am tired of goodreads","475":"ultimately this book is about choices why we make them and what happens when we don't know why enter your parents roomgo down the hallplay a gamestare at the white ceilingit's amazingly complex with little hidden crannies dead ends and clues but i don't think you need to piece everything together you can try but i think you'd end up falling down a rabbit hole there's so much more to this book than it's scant 200 some pages let on i think it will require a number of rereads","476":"the audio book is what made this so good for me with darnielle reading it himself plus the bonus of the small instrumental pieces of his own music thrown in inbetween chapters the coherence of the shifting timeline worked for me with the audio version it was like a friend telling a long story to while away the time stuck say in a van on tour i listened to this today on a long walk through san francisco the weather has warmed back up after a week of true overcast fall like days returning to what seems to be our new perpetual summer season for about two hours of the book i sifted through books at the sfpl big book sale out at fort mason the story lulled me into a calm reverie as my eyes skimmed the titles often this large sale causes me anxiety fear i have missed out on something great because i didn't get there earlier or apathy from the sheer volume of books today i felt glee that we as humans take the time to create for one another i picked up a handful of stuff including a kem lunn surf novel a rare ferlinghetti some other small poetry chapbooks solely based on their covers and a few cds including liz phair's exile in guyville which i realized i didn't have and wanted after i finished reading gina arnold's 33 1 3 book the other day i finished wolf in white van while strolling through fisherman's warf sidestepping around throngs of people each with their own story","477":" this was such a fantastic read i'm realizing that i tend to prefer books that are dense and i don't mean that pompously i think there's plenty of stephen king and john grisham that's plenty dense for me but a lot of books i enjoy are very spare and sparse perhaps the economy pulls for tighter writing this was a pick for my book club and we had very mixed opinions personally i enjoyed the parallel storylines even though that's a conceit that i often judge harshly there was a great sense of person and place and i thought it was sad and lovely i don't know much about the author's band but i'm not surprised he's a musician the end of this book felt like listening to one of my favorite sad songs","478":"finished this on audio during my drive back this evening the author also did the music during the book which was haunting and interesting this was really well written and thought provoking","479":" the mountain goats are one of my favorite bands i'm really looking forward to seeing them in september and john darnielle is one of my favorite lyricists so i was definitely excited to read this he sold me on himself as an author right away he creates a great character and got into his head i thought this might be 5 stars when i started this but i was a little disappointed to realize how little the plot would end up moving when we are introduced to our narrator protagonist something terrible has happened to him at some point it turns out that most of the books would reveal what happened and what it's done to him that's a great story in itself but there were just enough hints that i expected more to happen in the present of the book instead of just revelations about the past","480":"where or where have all the good editors gone this book is completely disjointed and random the character development was nonexistent and the plot took a turn for the worse blah","481":"feel like this is another one that demands a re reading before i can properly assess it though","482":"wow i liked this book a lot the writing was excellent descriptive raw i'll read everything darneille writes and pass this along to husband and son i'm neither a gamer nor a nerdy young man so i might never have picked it up if it wasn't recommended on the podcast literary disco i'm glad i did possibly my best read of the year","483":"really a 3 5 this is the kind of book that i feel like i need to read at least one more time before i totally get it its like reading a 200 page long mountain goats song in the best way intense a little confusing and kind of depressing and uplifting at the same time","484":"i always receive a bad first impression of the people books and music that i end up loving the most perhaps it is a sense of revulsion at something new and strange that has something to teach me i felt that way when i listened to the mountain goats the first time and i felt that way when i started reading darnielle's novel it was bloated dense thick i couldn't stand the digressions this novel's taught me things about myself my reactions to other people the myriad ways people struggle to maintain control in a world that is so random and cruel for me this is best book of the year no other book comes close","485":" occasionally a book will hit you right where you live and this one did i can't tell you how or why because that would give the book away and i really want you all to read this but i need to tell you why and how so okay back when i was around fourteen or fifteen i very nearly had an accident it was small and it was something i didn't have to go to the hospital for but i very nearly had an accident i wasn't being very careful and i didn't pay attention because i was angry at my parents and i almost had an accident i wish i could tell you more about the whys and wherefores of what was going on but overall this book hit me where i lived and hard very hard but back around the time i almost had an accident another thing also happened this was around the time that play by email games were really taking off all over the place a lot of homes had high speed internet for the first time and this was just starting to become widespread and i isolated for the most part as i was save for a few interactions with friends and a school that partly hated my guts because i had no way of explaining what the hell was wrong with me and refused to grow up all the way found a new outlet a new safe space a refuge and at the time though i was driven out of my refuge by the simple fact that as depeche mode said people are people and i had issues with social stuff and grammar the idea of a refuge from reality stayed with me but i could always disengage go back to being in the real world even if i didn't want to sometimes wolf in white van is about the people who couldn't disengage the people who went a little too far the people for whom their refuge is all they have the people who aren't as lucky to have that disengagement the way i don't seem to some days it's a novel about people with a hyperactive fantasy life because reality is just far enough out of reach and even more than that it's about the irrational acts people commit sometimes because the world doesn't understand them it's about the grief felt when these things happen and it is brilliant more as always below you go forward or you die sean wolf in white van starts with sean sean is the sole operator of a small company called focus games a play by mail game service that runs out of a filing cabinet in his apartment from his desk and filing cabinets sean creates the world of trace italian a post apocalyptic game of survival and an attempt to reach the mythical titular human settlement in a disaster ravaged kansas while there are other games trace italian is the most active and the one that takes up most of sean's time it has a small but dedicated subscriber base in the low hundreds a group who interact strangely through the turn based roleplaying game sending in their personalized moves to sean most of sean's world is focus games after an accident at sixteen that left him horribly disfigured with a face that looks like a tire tread a nasal cavity that needs to be irrigated daily and an odd sense of a world he can no longer interact with in the way he used to but his life is fairly uncomplicated unfortunately for two of his better players trace italian becomes something of an obsession lance and carrie a pair of high school sweethearts wind up taking the game way too far and sean gets caught up in the ensuing finger pointing and trauma the allegation that he's responsible for the tragedy that befalls lance and carrie unlocks memories that sean has blocked out memories about his accident and memories about the days leading up to it and so wolf in white van follows sean backwards through his memories and through his day to day life ending at the very incident that caused the mess in the first place the incident that caused sean to think up trace italian and all the incidents that brought him to where he now resides i suppose first i should tell you that plot description up there it isn't exactly accurate what john darnielle has done with wolf in white van is to create a first person sketch of a character but obscure the most important events in his life simply discussing the plot verges on spoiler territory as a lot of the events are obscured from the beginning there's evidence of a court case of course and evidence that sean's been in some kind of terrible accident but very little of the context for either of these events is revealed until later what this does is build a sense of ever growing dread as the story gets closer and closer to an event that's telegraphed from the beginning the context filling in more of the blanks until the final chapter the chapter where you know what will happen and that what will happen will destroy sean's life utterly and there's not a thing that can be done about it there's no subversion no flinching it unfolds until the event happens dragging you with it another thing darnielle does that i like is to keep the major events in the background until the end the present day sections of the story deal with sean's life after the accident the court case and the eventual fates of lance and carrie while these events are important to the story the focus is on sean and his life after the accident and after lance and carrie make their fatal mistake taking the game too far where any other novel would spend time on the accidents that caused sean's life to take not one but two turns for the worse the second making him the target of death threats and afraid to leave his house wolf in white van spends more time in the events' aftermath it makes it unique in that many books show the events leading up to the tragedy and then end the story darnielle shows that the aftermath is much more compelling and actually really sells that the aftermath is much more compelling it also helps sell the sense of dread in the piece since this isn't the story of a decline but the story of what comes after the decline and collapse and helping make sense of the decline and collapse when it happened and finally what i love the most about this book there's no agenda it's just a character study of a deeply troubled person that doesn't attempt to discern a reason for their behavior it's another thing that's rather refreshing about the whole mess a lot of books that tackle similar topics try to explore the underlying reasons behind such acts and the reasons are there if you want to look for them but wolf in white van steers clear of any such questions allowing the character study to provide any reasons or lack thereof darnielle doesn't spell anything out and shouldn't spell anything out as a large part of the tension of the book is about these decisions and presenting the events simply as events i even re read the final two sections looking for something anything to explain the behavior there was nothing so i sat there for a few moments devastated but then realized that was part of the point there is no point to the ending sometimes the feelings just get to be too much or the irrational process breeds a certain string of thoughts and then and then we have an accident or almost do or we go chasing some dream and wind up in a bigger mess than the one we ran away from there's no underlying reason and you can chase the chain of events if you want but the act itself there doesn't have to be a reason for the act it's something that comes out of the emotions the feelings the need to get away from what's around us now i understand this isn't for everyone reading bleak dread filled character studies with vivid descriptions of traumatic and disfiguring injury is not something i would wish on anyone and some may see this as a book without much of a plot or much of a payoff that's valid if that's what you're looking for i suggest you head elsewhere but for those willing to read a dark portrait of people who desperately want to escape for those who want a methodical book that will not let go even as it draws you deeper into darker territory with the wrenching knowledge that the inevitable will happen the event will be explained well wolf in white van is the book for you so if you think this is the kind of book you'd like to read or if you see a little of yourself in the hero es who just want to escape if you find yourself intrigued by what's depicted here then please buy this book it's a first novel and probably a little rough but it's tautly written and the methodical feelings it creates make the whole thing worthwhile if not well you didn't miss much it's an interesting book but i completely understand passing it by thinking of something clever here would only cheapen my message see you next week next week the stars my destination by alfred bester and then we start a new theme month as things loom either a redemption month where i review four books i never got to or a horror month where i give some interesting books to read along halloween or maybe even a king month since i haven't discussed big steve in enough detail already still see you then","486":" i was only halfheartedly interested as i read through this book but it definitely has its special moments that made it a worthwhile read it is certainly not for everyone nor do i consider it a quick and easy read it did bring up sentiments that i recall wondering as a teenage boy this is the best that i could take away though the author does a great job taking readers on a journey through this troubled young man's creative thought process which i presume mirrors the author's own real life experience as a composer i had never heard of mountain goats when i picked up the book but listening to some of their songs afterwards i sensed how their music could play as a soundtrack to this story like only an indy folk rock band could","487":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here knew nothing about the book other than the npr recommendations a 187 page preamble to the final 20 page core of what happened to the narrator as a teenager to set him on later paths like moves in the mail subscription game he creates and masters in later years last 20 pages are the most lyrically crafted part of the story from the thought processes of a troubled columbine era teen it was worth going thru the lengthy postlogue to get there i want to leaf back thru now to see if the bulk of knew nothing about the book other than the npr recommendations a 187 page preamble to the final 20 page core of what happened to the narrator as a teenager to set him on later paths like moves in the mail subscription game he creates and masters in later years last 20 pages are the most lyrically crafted part of the story from the thought processes of a troubled columbine era teen it was worth going thru the lengthy postlogue to get there i want to leaf back thru now to see if the bulk of the novel was as well written and i missed it more","488":"utterly mesmerizing want to come back and write way more on this later also at some parts very horrifying try and read this book if you can","489":"not sure exactly how i feel on this one read in two sittings on one day really liked the writing and story structure i need to reflect on it a bit more","490":" my first read of 2015 happy new year everyone what a strange little masterpiece a zigzagging timeline of events and choices that leads to sean's current predicament a disfigured man is the single brainchild behind a mail in scifi game in which he offers each player the choice for their next move while he recounts his own moves going back and forth from his childhood to the event which left him with half a face from the description i expected this book to be more on trace italian the game sean has created it's not so much about the game as it is about sean and his dark imagination","491":"a fascinating and emotional novel listen to black metal while you read it","492":" reading this book was like being on a non stop mine ride around the track we go again it starts off sounding like something from du0026amp d come to life as the older main character talks you feel sympathy for him you keep reading to figure out what happened to him then the story goes a bit mental is he mentally disturbed what is up with this guy and then just when you think the story has gone off in a completely different direction you get yanked back to his early self story the explaination if you call it that doesn't fully come until the very end where it gets thrown out quickly at the end i'm not sure what to think 5 stars for getting me to read it straight through but only 3 stars for actual content snd storyline i was just glad to get off this ride","493":"this is one of those beautiful incomplete stories wiwv lets you connect with its narrator and get a feel for a very specific moment in his life and how he and we can only really work from these small points to see who we once were and who we might become i hope john darnielle has more in him","494":"the ending wasn't really a surprise i mean it wasn't meant to be but ufda","495":"took a bit to get hooked on the story but well worth sticking with it insights and descriptions are simultaneously unique and familiar a remarkable combination i quite liked this book","496":"not sure what i think of this book i thought is was interesting but hard to read worried","497":"a compelling read i read it quickly and enjoyed it the pace structure and ideas in it i did have the sense that it was almost a ya novel in it's concerns even though the narrator is an adult and is dealing with some very adult problems i read it as a break from required reading and it was a good choice for this recommended","498":"great debut novel from darnielle i certainly hope he writes another","499":" maybe i have to read this one again after all it's been long listed for the national book award but as a lover of character driven novels this one had only one character and he didn't do much he thought a lot he thought about the accident that had left him hideously disfigured and kept him away from society he thought about the game he created years ago that caused a teenager to lose her life he thought about his time in the hospital recovering from the accident the few times he went outside he thought about how other people reacted to him and how he could put them at ease the one thing he didn't think about was what caused the accident darnielle makes the reader wait until the last page to find out exactly what the accident was but it came as no surprise for such a short book i could have done without the pages of typed role playing choices and a little more character plot development","500":"this book was so odd i couldn't decide if i liked it or not thus the average 3 stars it was a fine story just didn't lead anywhere in my opinion","501":"for like the first 40 pages or so i was a little worried it would end up feeling like that it's neat if you already like darnielle but not like something that can really stand up on its own almost immediately after thinking that it proved me wrong","502":"forced my way through three chapters of this one and had to put it away not a flicker of interest on my part but i tried because it has good rating and was high on the national book awards list for 2015 must be something appealing there for some people","503":"found this book brilliant at times but the story telling was unconvincing the rendering of the narrator after and before the incident just didn't ring true","504":" i almost did not start reading this because of darnielle's author bio on the backflap of the book it includes this he is widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation unless that was included as a hip jokey comment on his negligible fame as an indie rocker then it is an abysmal statement on his pomposity but i overlooked that annoyance and pushed on through the novel the story is hauntingly familiar the fate of lance and carrie seems stolen from another source film maybe and the idea of a mail art role playing game run by a disfigured outsider was interesting enough the fragmented time of the narrative is effectively dislocating but does not build tension rather just breaks up the monotony of the fairly short story it really sounds like i disliked this doesn't it darnielle does come up with a readable narrator with a consistent enough voice and the loose end mysterious ending is not annoying since it seems as logical a place to leave it as anywhere else darnielle is a decent writer but he needs to branch out to find better source material to jab into corners as flair really gor","505":"this was a dark book full of dangerous ideas beneath the surreal quality and back and forth nature to the narrator's story there's actually a pretty grim tale underneath i think the scariest point for me is that when you ask someone why did you shoot your parents or if possible to cross into the afterlife and ask a suicide why did you do it and they come back with i don't know the equivalent of it seemed like a good idea at the time that's terrifying we have no idea what drives our minds what might break and cause us to do something unspeakable this was a very interesting read i neglected to give it 4 stars mostly because of how disturbed i was by the ending of the book but it actually is very well put together i think that the claims of nothing happens or we don't get any closure that were laid by other reviewers are unfounded darnielle gives you plenty of details about the narrator's past you just have to give your brain some plasticity to put the details together and make some interesting assumptions","506":"i'm still not sure what i think the book was engaging but i'm still trying to figure out the point is the main character the wolf or the victim regardless i liked this one","507":"i read the first few lines of this plot summary thought sold and immediately chose this book as an exciting alternative to the string of moody downers i've been reading lately this was a mistake if you are also under the misguided notion that this will be some kind of adventure story about roleplaying games combined with real life maybe read ready player one or snow crash instead wolf in white van does deal with coming of age as a young geek creative empowerment and 80's fantasy fandom but it's also an increasingly joyless character study dealing with isolation tragedy and depression this book describes the feeling of being a young lonely fantasy fan so poignantly it makes me ache with nostalgia but in many other ways i find this protagonist hard to relate to both in his reverence of the most bleak and violent niches of the fantasy genre and in the way his thought process never fully explains his actions instead the point seems to be that it doesn't matter what someone's motivations are since it's their choices that ultimately define their path in life it's a thoughtful well crafted book and maybe it's not fair to dislike it for all the things it succeeds at but like the game trace italian the more i see of it the more i realize i'm not one of the people with the right mindset to enjoy it","508":"an odd book a very good book i am so intrigued by the main character his experiences and motivations are still murky not the best book but one that keeps me pondering","509":"first off i will say that this book really should be experienced with no prior knowledge of what it is about definitely skip the blurb with this one it's dark it's gritty and it's immensely human it also approaches a subject and i'm not going to tell you which subject in a way i've never seen before and really appreciate life isn't all about hard and true reasoning basically go forth and read this","510":"got more than halfway in and i am still just not into it its a library book and non renewable because someone is waiting on it but i don't think i even want to bother requesting it again a fine book but it never really drew me in","511":"well i liked this book enough to finish it anyway the back story was interesting to follow and the structure paid off in a creative story telling sense it kept my interest at times but then my mind would wander during others i get it it's a short book exploring the emotional impact of trauma and mental illness the carefully selected and constructed ways individuals protect themselves from pain to seek out meaning and purpose and validation the author uses story and science fiction and real life suckage to express feelings and rage and self pity and does have a rather profound way with words it worked for me and it didn't probably because i don't always think a book has to be about something underneath the story it just needs to do it well enough to keep my attention either way this book has its merits whether i got a lot out of the experience or not","512":"i'm a fan of john darnielle as a musician and a lyricist the book jacket even mentions that he's widely considered one of the best lyricists of this generation and he didn't disappoint the prose is so beautiful here that it was easy for for me to overlook a few of the plot points that i wish had been clarified","513":"nerding out for a second but the fact that this book was long listed for the national book award is a joke particularly when francine prose smith henderson and bret anthony johnston's new books were overlooked","514":"i was not impressed by this book most of the plot points went nowhere and didn't even come close to explaining the actions at any time of the protagonist i read it because it's our book club book but probably wouldn't have bothered otherwise even though i read it in matter of hours it was more due to it being short than anything else","515":" this book was interesting and disturbing i can't stop thinking about it and it scared me the central character is fascinating not totally likable though somehow not completely detestable it was such an interesting and not wholly reliable view into the warped mind of a suicide survivor it is timely since it involves guns and death and teenagers in a day and age when events of that sort are far too common the vehicle of the game is such a good choice on so many levels i love the mountain goats and i'd have read the book just because of my love of the band and john darnielle's lyrics in fact i probably did but having come out on the other side very little reminds me of the band's music but still i would recommend it","516":" having listened to darnielle's music for many years it's hard for me to evaluate this book on its own merits thematically darnielle has been trying to speak for alienated youth for years there is a line directly from this book to jeff and cyrus a line that presumably continues to his pre music career as a psychiatric nurse this book is another in a series of demonstrations of his deep deep empathy for outcasts and misfits i bet this would've been better as a concept album a la tallahassee but it's terrific as it is all the analogies obsessions and obscure references that one would expect reading this caused me to reevaluate the darnielle's recent albums and for that alone it deserves five stars recommended for mountain goats fans for everyone else start with all hail west texas work your way forward and read this when you get done with transcendental youth","517":"this one got off to a great start and darnielle's prose is even beautiful at times but it meanders a little too much a couple of times it's a very minor fault and overall i felt this was a very strong book","518":"this book is sad and powerful but i am not quite sure i liked it john darnielle whose music i am a little familiar with and i share a lot of interests i was reading conan stories just a few weeks before reading this and those same stories play a significant role in wolf in white van i totally related to the basic setting and premise of the story but i think i need to do a little more reflection to really get the whole book it has something do to with choices we make paths we take mazes we find ourselves in holes we dig ourselves into i think darnielle is interested in exploring the randomness of our decisions the lack of meaning behind our explorations of the world but it seems sad and dark and i'm struggling to find much to latch onto in this strong book","519":" psychological dark and sort of incredible also indirect it's of a structure where the 'now' of the story is in a time when nothing much happens but the past keeps cropping up only in the last few pages do we find out directly what happened yet when the narration moves there it at the same time moves out of the narrator's head he did this thing this horrible thing when he was another person and that's not a person he can understand anymore for me the best and defining scene was when he was coming out of the liquor store where he went to buy candy and met a couple teen boys hanging out in the parking lot one of them stopped him dude your face the book as a whole left me with that same feeling look at this it's ugly but please look","520":"i thoroughly enjoyed the first 1 2 to 3 4 of this book but them i realized it was already drawing to a close it leaves so many aspects as loose ends i think this was the authors intention but it still felt unsatisfying the book was beautifully written i'd give it a 3 5 5 if possible still just left wondering how all the given details lead up to the ending","521":"i need to process this book a little bit what i loved is that this one of the most original stories i have read in a long time the storytelling and the writing were excellent i think that it's going to stick with me for a bit but i still can't quite wrap my head around it","522":"wolfe in white van is poetry in prose darnielle's debut is a page turner with just the right amount of irksome mixed with sentimentality to be emotionally edgy","523":"wow this was good","524":" the best kinds of books reveal their secrets gradually leaving the reader not so much confused as eager to unpack what's going on this book certainly accomplishes this starting vaguely yet ominously enough that it's clear it's important to pay attention and not revealing all of its secrets until literally the last paragraph it's a strange sensation to not know exactly what's going on but to know that it matters and truthfully even afterwards it's still a bit unclear what was lead character sean's ultimate motivation was it somehow connected to the world of fantasy and gaming into which he was already slipping were there subliminal messages in the strange tapes he ordered in the mail did one of them mention a wolf in a white van some readers are frustrated by ambiguity this is probably not the book for them i've read books that deal with gaming before and identity in virtual gaming worlds and haven't particularly enjoyed them maybe it's the lo fi nature of the trace italian game in this book a role play game via mail but it worked very well here invoking themes of separate realities that bleed into and influence one another still ambiguous the book isn't clear on exactly what it's trying to say about this but maybe this is another reason why it's so effective i'm familiar with darnielle's work as frontman of the indie rock band the mountain goats i'm not a big fan exactly but i wouldn't skip a song if it popped up on internet radio if this book is any indication of a literary career however count me among the adoring this is easily my pick for best book of 2014","525":"this took me a bit to get into it's a book where you have to pay attention the language is beautiful every word meant to be savored the story haunting it probably isn't for everyone but its up for a national book award which got me interested","526":"sadly this just isn't my kind of book i think i would have to be in the right kind of mood to get more out of this story","527":" 4 5 rounded up to 5 the handsomely written at times cerebral yet emotionally intense narrative is told in reverse chronological order with flashbacks that anticipate events ahead or behind depending on one's temporal perspective by sean phillips a reclusive young adult first person narrator whose face is disfigured by a youthful mishap and who is the author of a text based role playing game whose instructions for each move or turn he mails to paying subscribers in an age before personal computers when a pair of subscribers take the fantasy game literally one of them dies and sean is sued gaming becomes a metaphor for free will vs fate in a work of fiction that is also a meditation on depression despair and self destructive impulses suicide survivors might want to skip this one the audiobook is well narrated by the author","528":"john darnielle has an amazing way with words and he has crafted a character whose quirks and madness all seem very real the concept of the narrator's game is also fascinating and i wonder if something like that could be done today using our ubiquitous fast paced technology it took me a few chapters to become oriented with the story but like a good quentin tarantino flick time and place bounce around effortlessly and just enough of the story unfolds when it needs to probably the best book i've read this year","529":"darnielle's distinctive writing style from his work with the mountain goats translates to novel form wonderfully a well written tale told through a slow unfolding of past events everything really only becomes clear as the last pages approach and even then a re read would surely surface even more nuance","530":" listened to this as an audiobook read by the author and it's maybe the best audiobook i've ever experienced the book itself is fascinating and dark and dangerous but also so thoughtful and emotionally resonant darnielle's reading of his work is heartfelt funny and ominous it's brilliant this book is very internal almost every sentence is trapped within the narrator's head but it never gets bogged down in ways you might expect then the scenes that involve other characters are fantastically realised but yeah this is definitely worth reading or listening to it's one of the only realist novels i've read this year and i think it's the best one i've come across in a while of course the subject matter and narrative choice will make this one of those books that just aren't for everyone","531":"i'm a huge john darnielle fan so i couldn't wait to read it it's really depressing i'm not sure how to feel about it","532":"obviously this rating is an anomaly everyone else appears to have loved this book or at the very least connected with it an some sort of way that i simply couldn't i felt absolutely nothing but boredom so maybe i'm not deep enough to get it but i felt totally detached despite trying desperately to find something in it that made sense but i couldn't though really maybe that's exactly what i was supposed to feel and everyone else is wrong in their deeper understanding of something that just many not be there ermmm probably not i'ts just me","533":"still musing didn't want to climb in to the van but think this wolf will follow me for a long time","534":"glad it was short this is the story of a game maker a man disfigured in his youth who writes computer games for a living he has a hit a big one but two kids playing the complex maze like dungeons and dragons knock off are killed the problem is i didn't like this guy i never began caring about his plight i'm a gamer this isn't my thing","535":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i don't really know what to say about this book i really really wanted to like honestly i did i'd seen some of my favourite booktubers haul it and then hearing a rave review from my friend fiona finally convinced me to shell out for it i just i didn't really enjoy it for a book that is only 206 pages it took me way too long to read the whole story just felt like a chore to power through i tried my hardest to really get into this book but i just don't think it was for me i think i jus i don't really know what to say about this book i really really wanted to like honestly i did i'd seen some of my favourite booktubers haul it and then hearing a rave review from my friend fiona finally convinced me to shell out for it i just i didn't really enjoy it for a book that is only 206 pages it took me way too long to read the whole story just felt like a chore to power through i tried my hardest to really get into this book but i just don't think it was for me i think i just expected a more detailed ending i wanted to know more about what happened to lance and carrie i wanted to know why sean felt he needed to shoot himself in the face i wanted to know so much more i guess i felt entitled to it after crawling through those 206 pages and when i didn't get it i was just wholeheartedly disappointed i felt cheated i know people who have read and enjoyed this book may pose a rebuttal and say 'it was an artistic and creative piece of literature and you just didn't get it' to which i would respond by saying that you're probably right i didn't really get it that doesn't decrease it's value to the people who did enjoy this book it just didn't live up to the hype in my eyes more","536":"i enjoyed this book mostly however i feel like it is a very polarizing read much like catcher in the rye your enjoyment is going to depend on how much you can get inside the head of or relate to the narrator it's largely about loneliness and escapism it's about how people can never really understand you and how you internalize that misunderstanding i guess like most songs by john darnielle the lead singer of the mountain goats as well as the author of this book it doesn't have a 'happy' message at least it didn't for me but it did manage to make me think and reflect a little","537":"finished right before bed last night and it seeped its way into my dreams","538":"as a huge fan of john darnielle's music i wanted to like this book so much more than i did he is such an evocative lyricist whose songs although many are highly autobiographical are so universal that some have become like hymns to me and maybe that's why wolf in white van fell a bit short for me it seemed like more of the suggestion or outline of a really amazing story than the fleshed out fully realized experience that i wanted it to be and with his novel unlike his haunting songs the sparse ideas fell flat without underlying melodies and harmonies to fill in what was seemingly left unsaid","539":"the writing definitely engrossed me and carried me through this dark bizarre story i am not sorry i read it but i can't say i recommend it either","540":"this book reminded me of curious incident of the dog in the nighttime both are well written and give an interesting spin on the normal narrative of a novel while curious incident was based on autistic child wolf in white van gives a nerdy role playing game guy with a gunshot wound","541":" if you are an acolyte of the mountain goats and are tuned into john darnielle's nexus of adderall and fantasy novel epic and in a world gravitas applied to every furtive teenage movement this book will be a 2 vorpal sword of worshippe justification if not it's going to feel a little like riding a tilt a whirl operated by the exact person i just described wolf in white van ping pongs through time and causality to depict a tragic event and the quantum world that unfolds from it and how it begets tragedies of its own that get absorbed in the consuming void of the adolescent mind it is beautiful and not sad which i think is darnielle's power depicting teenage desperation without pity or even comeuppance and not making his characters exactly heroes but people that live on some edge that is right there but a little too sharp for the rest of us in tribute i will now listen to relayer by yes 2112 by rush and bridge of sighs by robin trower just because they were mentioned in the novel's final un raveling then i will listen to the best ever death metal band in denton by the mountain goats and draw a skull on something hail satan and i hope darnielle wins the national book award for which he was nominated","542":"what a ride this book took me on i expected the best from john being a fan of his music and i was not disappointed in the least you will be jerked around between real life and the trace italian and you may get confused a little but that's ok because they are both connected in ways that define who sean the protagonist is while delving into a world you may have never thought about","543":" i really wanted to like this more i actually didn't mind the non linear narrative so i think the disappointment is more of a mismatch between the misleading book description and actual story i was expecting the fantasy world to consume the narrator in a way that it actually didn't and to learn how it really got into the minds of the victims instead the majority of the story was about how the narrator coped with his disfigurement not to say that's a bad narrative in and of itself but still not what i'd been led to believe","544":"this book lives up to the hype although it's not frenetic in the way that word indicates i did not want it to end and yet i am glad it did end because the story is not in danger of spoliation with a spare style darnielle creates an incredibly vivid picture it may be a cliche to say but the book is meditative even though the title sounds menacing the story isn't really","545":"while i am not a fan of his music john darnielle can spin a yarn like nobody's business he knows how to capture the stranger facets of human nature which really helps to bring his main character such depth heartbreaking line mom i don't want you to be lonely son who is the narrator mom i was always going to be lonely","546":"this is a good thinking book told backwards and ending with the accident that changed sean's life i'm still not exactly sure how i feel about that but i enjoyed the rest of it","547":" this is the best book i have read this year i am not a five star reviewer unless it's the great gatsby or gravity's rainbow white wolf in white van is a haunting mesmerizing read that i would urge most people to avoid told in a non linear fashion the novel speaks about isolation loneliness and the mystery and misery of life i read a review by dwight garner before reading this and i was miffed that garner lets the cat out of the bag in the first sentence in retrospect he was right sean phillips blows his face off with a rifle survives somehow and tries to exist as a physical grotesque from that point on the actual shooting occurs at the end of the book and the utter useless aimlessness of the act is as brutal a truth as one can imagine a lot of horrible stuff happens everyday witness brussels but darnielle understands that most bad things happen because disaffected isolated people do thoughtless stupid shit i was reading this book at the gym and somebody asked me what it was about and i fudged the answer how do you tell someone you are reading a book about a failed teen suicide who is horribly disfigured and then creates a fantasy game about surviving in savage plague stricken world which ultimately kills some overly enthusiastic game player in my case you don't this is a book about misfits and it is written by someone who knows misfits and is also a great singer songwriter the mountain goats as somebody who frequently feels outside the group i related to this book deeply darnielle understands how it feels to be an outsider and he tries to explain the unexplainable there are no remedies or solutions but there is a need to look at the harsh truth that drives so many to despair sean phillips survives and even creates john darnielle does even better in writing this novel he creates a work of art that makes you think this is by far my longest review and it is deserved read it at your own risk","548":"great writing after reading so much ya lit action action action this happens now this happens this book was a nice change of pace i like the way darnielle skips around in time slowly revealing details about the main event pretty bleak though","549":"so this book was written by john danielle who has through the years always been my favorite or second favorite musician i definitely feel a greater connection with his art than i do with that of any other musician i can rock out to his music and cry to it i can scream along or meditate to it i am so heavily biased that you shouldn't even be reading this if you want an honest review with all that aside i loved this book the language was moving and emotional the story was true and dark and i saw myself reflected in the characters it's also a brisk read which is nice i also liked that i got to see more in to john the author through his character and his story it was really good 4 3 5","550":" woah this book kind of broke me i was at the beach with a friend on the day i started reading this unfortunately i'd left my summer reading novel at home and i had nothing to dive into no pun intended my friend offered me her bag of books and i miraculously stumbled upon this little gem whose title i'd never even heard of before i never would have expected the kind of philosophical heart breaking journey this dragged me on in the 2 or 3 hours it took to read the entire thing the author's writing style weaves you along the story's narrative in a natural poetic flow despite the plot being barely chronological and frequently shifting to a new thought or place in sean's life it burst with emotion and felt so smooth to read that i hardly even noticed how pieced together it was like the threads in a quilt or like jigsaw pieces slowly assembling into single recognizable image the ending is not really an ending at all and leaves the future unclear yet it is surprisingly satisfying nonetheless like it almost makes sense to conclude on the particular scene it did i won't ruin that for you overall this novel is immensely beautiful in a simple and complicated at the same time kind of way if you like stories that are more reflective and dreamlike instead of linear and plot focused this is definitely one that you should try","551":"not good at all i kept going past my fifty page rule due to the unique telling of the story hoping it would get better it didn't not sure what the buzz is about maybe i'm missing something","552":"i found this story boring and hard to read it's jumps around from past to present even though it is a short novel it took me a long time to finish","553":"boy who shot himself in the face @ 17 now runs mail in game trace italianreally interesting concept idea of 2 high school kids who take game too seriously and end up deadsad take on parents teenage lifeshot himself for no reason would like more backgroundeverything didn't connect random characters etc","554":"this had a lot of potential but ended abruptly","555":"a very haunting tale chilling not sure i am a fan of the disjointed backwards narrative without the mystery of what happened which all characters know but the reader does not i don't think there'd be much driving the story along","556":" here's another book by a rock star i got a soft spot for them at first i made a plan to separate this novel from the mountain goats' music make compartments for them in my brain but really what's the point or is it even possible i bought wolf in white van the day it came out because of john darnielles's awesome band so why pretend the two are separable entities wolf in white van is a god damned terrifying book about a disfigured adolescent who creates a rpg there but for the grace of cuthulu... a lifetime ago i was an out of step teen awkward in the suburbs staying in my room for the most part while i tried to piece together obsessions with science fiction attraction to weapons the mysteries of other lives music's odd power the enigma of girls... i used to draw skulls and all consuming flames and play du0026amp d and wonder what was coming next and how ill prepared i'd be for it i probably scared the shit out of my parents who could only really watch from far away and offer clunky advice and silently wonder how everything would turn out well it turned out ok except for the aging and the mortality bit but they couldn't help that now i'm an adult i have a family a decent job relative happiness my health but for so many friends from back then from faces passed at parties and in the streets of my hometown between the ages of twelve and twenty maybe even later than that it didn't turn out so good accidents suicides overdoses long term drug casualties the gauntlet of adolescence was brutal but ill equipped to process it let alone deal as we are at such an age mercifully i somehow managed to come out the other side not everyone does sean the first person protagonist of wolf in white van does not wolf in white van is satan speaking the rock record played backwards vying for your soul suicide even murder is sometimes a spur of the moment act the book ratchets up as it goes memories or words triggering another dreadful layer another time in sean's familiar resonating life the ending seen coming from a mile away spelled out clearly before the novel is even half way done can never be prepared for a harrowing book the rating includes memories of me and my kids singing monkey in the basement when they were tiny how did the monkey get there how did the monkey get there also included is tallahassee the whole fucking album stories of a relationship in its throes with no way out especially the chorus from no children i hope you die i hope we both die and for that ponytail line in there will be no divorce which gives me shivers to this day wolf in white van sort of gutted me now my kids are about to enter the gauntlet themselves or are already in it all i can do is watch from far away offer clunky advice and silently wonder how everything will turn out when we all know how everything turns out","557":" i find myself rather perplexed upon finishing wolf in white van i sat pondering it for a while then went straight to goodreads to read previous reviews from other readers many ok most are glowing and bursting with adoration this is not the feeling i am walking away with so i must be missing some obvious deeper meaning this is not a gamer book like ready player one or ender's game this is about a game called trace italian but this book focuses on the creator and his sense of reflection about his teenage years and later in life too as an adolescent he suffered a self inflicted injury that altered the course of his life significantly he cannot live and function like most people and spends a lot of time secluded thus the deep powers of reflection the reader spends much time bouncing from current day to the past and in communication with a number of trace italian players some bits feel personal like an exposed wound being probed whilst other parts seem like an excerpt from a drug induced fog weird and not to my taste a great amount of effort went into the trace italian process and game advancement i appreciate that and found this work to be well written but on the whole this just wasn't my cup of tea i guess i didn't get it","558":"another book that i continue to re read at least once a year if not more","559":"this strange little book i made the decision to change my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars initially upon finishing the book i was unfulfilled i flew thorough this book and loved the nonlinear format i couldn't wait to find out more about sean his accident and the world he had come to know i finally reached the end and felt completely let down i had seen this book appear on just about every best of 2014 lists and after completing it i was baffled you're probably wondering why the 4 star review honestly because i keep thinking about this damn book and oddly enough i keep thinking about sean this book truly required me having some reflection time this book will not be appreciated by all though i am glad i gave it a fair shot","560":" this book appealed to me because the main character is a gamer the writing was very theatrical at times and yet succinct and well done in spite of the fact it was very dark and sad i liked it more than i thought i would you learn at the beginning that the main character is disfigured and how he navigates through his life and the choices he makes because of his situation rang true given his personality type i also really enjoyed the interweaving of the game the author preformed through the story and the introduction of a few of the characters who played the game it was interesting to get a peek into these personalities the only thing i didn't like was the lack of clarity as to why things happened as they did i am sure that is the way it was intended or perhaps i should do more reading between the lines than i am capable of being so much older than the characters are during when these actions happened","561":"a dark novel read in the height of summer this one unexpectedly hit the spot with themes of loneliness isolation escapism and gamification in its own way a quick read full of beautifully woven words that stay with you","562":"i wanted to like this book more than i actually did there are some nice passages here john darnielle is a good writer for sure but the overall endeavor falls a little flat is it me or did the second half of the novel lose a lot of steam energy drive it also seems kind of gimmicky to withhold major information like what happened to sean for so long still an enjoyable read","563":"built up to an amazing last chapter","564":" while i understand that this text could appear a bit flat to a reader as some of the reviews indicate i found it to be the best text i have read from 2014 the reason that darnielle's debut receives such high praise from me is that it reads very much like an american gen x coetzee while the latter's novels approach the difficult social issues of south africa in the second half of the 20th century and have been therefore recognized with the nobel prize the subject matter of wolf in white van seems no less trivial to darnielle and while apartheid is certainly a much greater travesty than the suburban malaise of turn of the 90's socal it doesn't necessarily make for a more fecund bed from which to germinate a text that addresses experience in a brutal and deeply personal way to say i like wolf in white van would be a lie it's a difficult text the narrator is in some regards despicable however in his admittedly dilatory elaboration of the disfigurement of sean's face darnielle also manages to elaborate on the nature of american institutions that disfigure our relationships to family to peers even to those who are the very closest to us in our secret spaces i understand that this novel is also particularly appealing to me because of its pertinence to my class gender and generation that said please trust me when i say it is as relevant and accurate as any text ever written that has attempted to broach the matte grey ennui of the suburban 90's and return with some glossy pearl","565":"a must read for any mountain goats fan or really anyone who's been through something difficult this book provides a beautiful pop culture saturated look into the rebuilding process of the human mind one which sweeps between catharsis and devistation with the elegance of a well tuned song this book sets off ancient and dusty switches in the brain and if you're anything like me you'll form a deeply personal connection","566":"it's actually kind of astounding that a book that focuses almost entirely on suicide manages to completely avoid the topic of mental health ultimately this book felt like a very long extraordinarily drawn out character sketch and with writing like the example i listed below it's hard to justify reading it at all i was looking hard at the tape shell and thinking the thoughts i get looking at tape shells am i the only person who gets the hard creeps from this guy's face was what i was thinking specifically i was looking at the singer from yes his mouth looked like it was from somebody else's head i'm sure it was great for other people but it was definitely not anywhere near my cup of tea","567":"i feel like i should have liked this more than i did but i had a lot of trouble getting into this","568":"i had high hopes after hearing the author interviewed on npr the premise sounded interesting the author was engaging i wish the book had lived up to those first impressions i didn't hate the book but it simply did very little for me it was rather dull and uninteresting i wish i could say otherwise","569":"as with most things darnielle related i am a fan of this book some of the game sections lost me a bit but then his amazing way with words and human emotion pulled me back in","570":"conan obsessed teen reads aloud reminisces about his fantasy role playing game for the most part darnielle has talent but i found this such such a slog","571":"beautifully crafted in content meaning and form","572":"a truly imaginative story with some of the most honest and visceral descriptions of human sensory experiences very engaging throughout and takes place right near where i grew up","573":" also posted at oops i read a book again i feel like even after a week from finishing it it's still too early to talk about wolf in white van that i might not be able to discuss the full breadth of how and what it means to me because i don't even know all the ways it has affected me or made me realize things yet but i'll still try i tried not getting into any spoilers but i just have to discuss some symbolism and shit so there might be spoilers not plotwise though ack just tread carefully it took me two chapters to immerse myself into john darnielle's wolf in white van this dark self aware and existential read i was quite lost at first but then i realized that the beauty of this book is in not knowing everything right away you gradually get to know sean from his thoughts opinions and feelings interspersed with his memories and what is currently happening in his life it unfolds like a mystery the reader thrust into sean's mind without a prologue and we get to our grips and find our footing slowly but surely helped by darnielle's prose that succinctly yet vividly nails depression and feeling lonesome i didn't want to put it down as i had questions i needed answers to now now now but i had to put it down on many occasions just so i can mark all the passages that struck me yes it's that kind of book i thought this book would be more about trace italian and as i play dungeons u0026amp dragons i was definitely interested in that while i'm surprised that there wasn't as much about trace italian as i foresaw instead it was more introspective in nature focusing on sean's psyche i welcomed the unexpected i embraced it and i loved how it was completely about sean while sure it made me want more from the book probably why it didn't garner all the stars and all the love from me i also acknowledge that narrative choice by the author so all is well it's so hard for me to discuss this book as it has so many facets that we can mine for endless discussions in fact after i read the book i immediately had to discuss it with jean and we ended up going at it book club style pointing out different events in the novel and probable meanings and symbolism aside from tackling depression having dark thoughts feeling lonesome and being isolated and alone it also showed that our parents and upbringing affect us both in the littlest and the biggest ways grown up sean paints his parents as kind and understanding but as we go back in time back to the moment that resulted to his disfigurement you can probably guess how it happened we find that his parents were not great they were present but absent as sean tells his friend kimmy at some point when they were seventeen cool parents are parents who know nothing his parents were cool they let him do whatever but it might probably because they don't care much and oh gosh the meaning of the title i didn't get it right away but after discussing with jean it all came crashing down on me and i had chills fucking wolf in white van here's the full quote but at that moment all i could see was the wolf in the white van so alive so strong hidden from view unnoticed concealed and i thought maybe he's real this wolf and he's really out there in a white van somewhere riding around maybe he's in the far back pacing back and forth circling the pads of his huge paws raw and cracking his thick sharp claws dully clicking against the raised rusty steel track ridges on the floor maybe he's sound asleep or maybe he's just pretending and then the van stops somewhere maybe and somebody gets out and walks around the side to the back and grabs hold of the handle and flings the doors open wide maybe whoever's kept him wears a mechanic's jumpsuit and some sunglasses and he hasn't fed the great wolf for weeks cruising the streets of the city at night and the wolf's crazy with hunger now he can't even think maybe he's not locked up in the back at all he could be riding in the passenger seat like a dog just sitting and staring out the open window looking around checking everybody out maybe he's over in the other seat behind the steering wheel maybe he's driving by my and jean's understanding it's a symbolism on what makes us tick what pushes us to think dark thoughts and act on them the reason why we do bad things it's hidden or maybe asleep but then maybe just maybe someone lets it out and since the wolf's crazy with hunger now he can't even think and just wreaks havoc in its wake but maybe it's not even hidden it's riding in the passenger seat always with us or it's behind us or maybe it's driving us chills man i had this phase where i researched about psychopaths and sociopaths and that's what crossed my mind when i reread this passage or when we just break and all our bottled up anger or frustrastion blows up and gets the best of us he can't even think gah john darnielle you are bloody awesome i heavily empathized and sympathized with sean in wolf in white van because he says these things that i just see myself in him i knew i've been depressed some time ago but reading this makes me question that maybe i've been depressed for a long time i just saw myself a lot in sean his being lonesome and that universal need and want for human connection his difficulty in opening up and expressing his building of walls around his heart sean is just a guy i could completely relate to reading this novel was such an immersive experience for me but at the same time it was difficult too i mean this line i didn't feel like i'd really won anything but i had come through the day no worse off than i'd come into it which as i have been telling myself for many years now is a victory whether it feels like one or not my heart and this here and there alone reflecting i'd bump up against what felt like a buffer zone between me and some vast reserve of grief but its reinforcements were sturdy enough and its construction solid enough to prevent me from really ever smelling its air feeling its wind on my face and this i didn't have a whole lot of friends anyway so i didn't feel abandoned so much as reminded i just can't my feelings yeah sean you wouldn't get hurt as much if you didn't have a lot of people that can hurt you but even though this book made me sad and melancholic it was also hopeful in a way that even though sean had been suffering from depression he's here he's living and he feels normal who are we to judge that he isn't in fact living at all just holed up in his apartment he's here and he's living and he's content in his own way i know my blog focuses on young adult novels more but wolf in white van has crossover appeal dare i say do read wolf in white van if you loved catcher in the rye or if you're in the mood for something like it i do hope you end up picking up wolf in white van so we can discuss and if you've already read it please talk to meeeeeeeeeeeee i highly recommend this book with its profound and beautiful prose i mean duh john darnielle of mountain goats wrote it and have you heard the lyrics to their songs yeah imagine that being a novel and wolf in white van is yet another proof that i love anything written by musicians","574":" intro wolf in white van wwv by john darnielle is an exceptionally written novel that explores the extremes of escapism and imagination for the reader who only reads at the surface it may appear to be nothing more than a somewhat depressing piece of fiction for the close reader however this is a work that should be admired from the setup to mystery to the characters wwv is the epitome of what modern literary fiction should look like overview wwv follows both the aftermath and the events that led up to what is only referred to as the main character sean's accident in the backdrop is sean's paper and pen role playing game trace italian which ultimately sees sean find himself embattled with a lawsuit what really makes this plot intriguing is the juxtaposition or perhaps lack of juxtaposition between sean's reality and sean's fantasy world of his mind and game sean often appears to live in a fantasy world even when he is not imagining things that is sean has a tendency to refute how reality really is even though it is evident that deep down he does know it really is moreover sean consistently switches in and out of reality and fantasy one minute he may be describing his true surroundings and the next minute delving into one of his elaborate fantasies or memories with all that said it should be admitted that the novel is not perfect a few minor subplots are underdeveloped and some even those that are developed fail to offer much to the larger plot to refrain from any spoilers all i will mention here is that the relationship between sean and the character kimmy may leave some wanting for more in terms of closure and not in a good way perhaps the worst flaw although unavoidable in a sense is the problem that older generations will have connecting to the story and world of sean for any one older than forty or so the escapism found here epitomized by sean's game trace italian may very well prove to be uninteresting or even somewhat confusing furthermore even for readers who are familiar with role playing games the use of one as a central plot device may potentially isolate those that have little interest in such outlets of escapism this is obviously not the fault of the author however it is still worth mentioning in order to provide fair warning conclusion for the reader with an open enough mind to immerse themselves in sean's world of fantasy mixed with reality wwv will prove to be a delightful read a novel is meant to not only tell a story but also build a sketch of a fictional world this fact is what truly makes the work so impressive not only must readers acquaint themselves with sean's reality world but they must also acquaint themselves fantasy world the problem with this task though is that readers may very well find themselves asking is there truly any fundamental difference between the two","575":" not sure about this one the writing is beautifully poetic and the ideas are deeply dug but each subplot never feels fully linked to the rest i feel like i missed a big a ha encompassing conclusion so all of these great smaller ideas were never finally fused into a story to give it all meaning i don't want to go into much detail but i feel like many points in the story are okay thanks for telling me this but what does it have to do with x need to brood on it for awhile to see if it settles any better after some more afterthought","576":" first off i'll say that there are some good things going for this book you get to know the character's inner life and thoughts in surprising detail the chronology and set up of the novel is relatively unique and effectively furthers certain symbolic elements the novel approaches a difficult topic of poor adolescent mental health attempted suicide with directness and avoids heavy moralizing and or giving the self violence a point this might frustrate some but i found it interesting and perhaps more true to life than any of us would comfortably like to admit it's short it's easy to discuss in say a book club setting because the story is polarizing and there's plenty of theorizing about what it means so much so that discussion threads online provide a gold mine of possible book club discussion points i feel that what the book does best is illustrate if not either wholly endorse or repudiate a subset of adolescent young adult male nerd culture that reinforces and glorifies fantasy violence as the supreme male ideal i would argue that ultimately the novel ends up demonstrating the danger limitation and uselessness of such beliefs about masculinity but again the book avoids a really clear message overall instead leaving the reader to puzzle out some sort of meaning should they choose to do so almost as though they themselves are entering into some kind of game that said i hated this book felt it was overall a pain to read and it left me feeling at once bored depressed confused and angry and while in the end i found it hard to feel empathy for or even understand the main character or his actions as a whole i will leave that aside and base most of this review on the structural elements that annoyed me to no end the book was incredibly boring for a story involving a great deal of dramatic plot events including an attempted suicide a separate accidental death and other grave injury in addition to a set of teenagers essentially acting out a fantasy treasure hunt game this book is incredibly slow boring and stilted apart from the deliberate actions of the last chapter there is virtually no action in this novel everything takes place in the main character's head his inner dialogue which is plodding and painfully non sequitur at times throughout the novel there are many italicized passages of player directions from the game the main character produces few if any of these passages do anything to advance the plot illustrate character or do anything but reemphasize the depth to which the main character lives vicariously through his game and its players and the intensity of his fantasies these passages are gratuitous in nature and i ended up skimming or skipping most of them by the time i'd reached the midpoint in the novel the novel is confusing leaves the reader feeling weird unsteady and depressed without much real point or purpose does this reinforce perhaps the author's purpose an illustration of adolescent wrongheadedness isolation and mental illness certainly is it worth my time when i am also left feeling bored and pitiless for the character maybe although this leads me to my final complaint which is that if the author has a point in writing this other than just to tell a story then said point as stated above and further possible points are debated endlessly in other reviews could have been made sooner less awkwardly and in a more sympathetic and practical manner overall i am neither better nor worse off for having read this novel although i offer that assessment with this caveat this is not in my opinion a great novel for teenagers especially teenagers who tend toward any of the character traits the main character sean exhibited the last thing a confused lonely fantasy obsessed teen needs is a novel that ends with a teenager shooting themselves in the face with a rifle","577":"holy shit was this good i nearly gave it a full 5 stars cannot wait until this one is officially out and i can start pushing it for others to pick up so so good","578":" i think i would have enjoyed this book more if i had a better understanding of fantasy games and heavy metal music than i do i didn't get anything out of the pages that i assume were lists of possible paths through sean's game world so those passages were wasted on me and left me feeling lost not too surprising i guess because generationally i'm closer to sean's mother than sean still i thought the way the story was told in a backward to forward sequence was clever especially considering the book's title and many of the lines were rich with double meanings there's enough depth and psychological probing to make the story compelling which is what kept me reading instead of oversimplifying a complex situation the author shows how a horrifying decision like the one sean made could be arrived at as if in a game or a dream and yet remain incomprehensible to him and those who love him definitely seems like the kind of book that would get better on a second reading","579":"this wasn't a terrible book but it also didn't really keep my attention it felt very scattered and like it ended before it even began it's a quick read and it has it's moments i just wasn't crazy about how abruptly it ended and the bouncing around didn't really help","580":"i'm trying to form a coherent review but all i can come up with are single words like what and jesus and but john darnielle can write you guys whew","581":"liked the parts about the game the trial didn't care about the rest","582":"imagine someone with a better vocabulary were writing this review so instead of reading my original and different you'd be reading words that better capture what this book is it's a quiet steady story perhaps matter of fact perhaps understated and then boom you may be stopped in your tracks but the story continues without betraying its rhythm it's arguably the best way to tell this story the sequencing is great there are several lines worthy of underlining and quoting but i had to rush this book back to the library so you won't find them here my two favorite things about this book shrewd storytelling this is not a neatly packaged fiction of resolutions what likeable guy sean is a fictional character that doesn't feel made up that doesn't seem like someone's reactionary idea of a person these book blurbs say it best \"i loved everything about this book blisteringly authentic like darnielle set out to adapt an old iron maiden t shirt as a literary novel \" --austin grossman\"wolf in white van is a testament to the ways in which all of us use imagination to survive and the ways in which that same imagination can take over our lives until there's little else left it brings us inside both the reality and the fantasy of day to day life in the way that only john darnielle can read this book you'll never hold another one like it \" --joseph fink","583":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here halfway through the book i had a review all planned out wolf in white van would be an unputdownable gut wrenching affair the sort of book you finish with a bitter taste in your mouth but fundamentally whole it was going to be an easy five stars i was going to talk about how i delayed getting john darnielle's book for fear of disappointment for fear that it couldn't match the raw power of my favorite songwriter's music how i'd found the theme of role playing games off putting how actiony halfway through the book i had a review all planned out wolf in white van would be an unputdownable gut wrenching affair the sort of book you finish with a bitter taste in your mouth but fundamentally whole it was going to be an easy five stars i was going to talk about how i delayed getting john darnielle's book for fear of disappointment for fear that it couldn't match the raw power of my favorite songwriter's music how i'd found the theme of role playing games off putting how actiony things had always bored me and then how when i finally opened the novel darnielle's intensely empathetic masterpiece plunged me into the alien mind of an escapist outcast with ease how darnielle's prose like his songs transmitted feelings almost telepathically with an incisiveness you couldn't capture except by direct quotation i was grateful at that moment that the plot was heading towards a clear climax that it was not only an astonishingly accurate map of a twisted inner landscape but also a good old fashioned story it felt like a gift by the time i finished it was already past midnight by then i was pushing through the text the way you might keep refreshing facebook on a lonely night knowing it won't do you any good but feeling like it's already too late to stop i should have known darnielle's music after all is a double edged sword a ladder made of feeling names that you can climb up - or song after song deep deep down here too i'd let myself descend too far \"and i wondered why i was doing this but at the same time i felt like it was too late to turn back \" the fantasy world which sean the protagonist of wolf in white van inhabited was like this too there's no denying that his morbid daydreaming and months spent inside book and tv worlds contributed to his attempted suicide but the imaginary world he created in the aftermath was also his means of survival - something to hold on to meaning in the making and here i was drawn too deep into the book swimming back up with it the climax was there exactly as promised - which i guess was the problem the book said repeatedly that there would be no explanation no reason there was just the event but i already knew there wasn't a reason i wanted more almost from the start i liked darnielle's decision to run the story backwards the climactic suicide attempt was doubly fixed not just already there in the book waiting to be read but already there in sean's past something irrevocably present for him to come to terms with \"this is why people cry at the movies because everybody's doomed no one in a movie can help themselves in any way \" empathy could creep in this way i thought that you couldn't like sean in chronological order you wouldn't be able to gather the sort of understanding necessary for pity and forgiveness towards his young dumb self but older sean was all right and self aware he said it himself \"i'm a little stupid but i'm all right \" he'd done his penance now he could guide us back to the troubled teenager he'd been but i stopped following him along the way the book got progressively darker and i stopped seeing it but that was just it penance doesn't make sins make sense not all meanings can flow backwards through time \"wolf in white van \" as the novel tells us is a supposedly satanic message heard when playing a certain rock album backwards i didn't realize until i read one of the reviews on here that if you \"play\" wolf in white vann backwards which is to say chronologically you get an almost cheerful tune it's a story of redemption of a man learning to live in the aftermath of a catastrophe of his own making backwards or forwards it's about making meaning for better or worse - and making do without it about frightening things inside us wolves behind white picket fences children in good families who struggle to live with their pain - and about clearing out white space behind the wolf mask stuck to your face sean's accident leaves him terribly disfigured and filling it with something better it's about owning your deeds and splitting them off from yourself sometimes in one mental act \"it isn't really much of a mystery this occasional need i have to comfort my father i did something terrible to his son once \" when i started writing this review i thought i would give wolf in white van four stars it was better than i anticipated halfway through but i liked it less now i've made myself a net of meanings to like it with to catch that fifth star more","584":"i really enjoyed the writing and i was transported back to awkward teenage years where i could completely understand the desire to be withdrawn from most everybody around you as long as you had a link to an outside community i go back and forth on the length of the book 200 pages seems too short but short of an appendix of every move description from trace italian i don't know where more story should have been added","585":"i read this aloud to jordan in the car to and from his grandparents' farm in east tennessee hearing the words spoken was a very cool way to experience john darnielle's writing which is stark and sometimes unexpected and beautiful the structure was non linear which i liked as it developed the main character in a more even well rounded way than a strictly chronological one might have overall a somewhat difficult read in subject matter not vocabulary or length but an accessible one too with moments of tenderness that hit you when you're not looking for them","586":" so in writing a review to this book i'm reminded once more of the somewhat arbitrary nature of scoring books on a five star scale i just rated bradbury's the illustrated man two stars meaning i barely enjoyed it i'm rating this one three stars meaning i liked it but i was hoping for a bit more i have to qualify this review a bit and say that giving out ratings here is a bit like scoring high school english essays i can give an a to a freshman paper and an a to a senior paper and those two a grades can mean totally different things well bradbury's work gets two stars on the freshman level scale from me and darnielle's wolf in white van gets three stars on some more sophisticated scale have i clarified meaning here or have i just blurred meaning further i'm digressing either way so back to the whole review i'll start by saying that i appreciate what darnielle's novel wolf in white van is trying to do all the more so coming off of bradbury's short stories honestly darnielle's novel makes bradbury's work look like student writing bradbury's worlds and characters seems so simple in comparison so flat in wolf in white van our narrator is sean a dude with a horrifying disfigurement that dictates much of his life as a way of coping with the physical and psychological trauma of the accident sean creates a game called trace italian a mail subscription game that's essentially a really complex snail mail version of a choose your own adventure book subscribers mail their moves to sean and based on the players' decisions sean mails back a script two players take this game a bit too seriously and as a result sean is ensnared in a tragic event that in some way mirrors his own accident so yeah i appreciated the depth to sean's character and further i appreciated the careful structuring of the novel wolf in white van is a good example of a novel where the structure does more than merely tell the story efficiently in many ways actually the story is told inefficiently because of the structure but that's okay because this isn't really a novel about a story it's more about contemplation of feelings and moods on an existential level the novel is an admission i think that life doesn't always make sense that there aren't always easy or logical answers to the questions and circumstances that plague the human existence in short i'm not sure i can say i loved this one and i'd only recommend it to others cautiously despite the depth of sean's character the careful structuring and the author's clear talent in constructing lyrical prose at the end i was just like this huh i liked the ending i thought it was powerful enough and yet i'm still left a bit cold by it all then again i'm still processing this book it's stuck in my head clearly there's some power there","587":"while not destined for mass market appeal i enjoyed wolf in white van immensely and am disappointed that i cannot think of more people to recommend it to i fear this title may have a very specific fan base more cult following than anything else that being said i personally found sean to be such a familiar character that this book leaves me feeling haunted beautifully crafted i found the audio version to be fantastically read by the author john darnielle","588":"i thought it was a really good read some of the darker parts of the story came off a little forced to me but darnielle perfectly captured how it feels to be a weird teenager also i would play the trace italian right the heck now why doesn't it exist in real life or maybe it does","589":"i really enjoyed this book because it was so different from anything i would normally read it was also interesting because it explored the what was for me the fringe as i was growing up fantasy role playing games heavy metal music with satanic back masking graphic comics and the culture that goes with all of that pretty intriguing view into the mind of a kid that was into all of that","590":" as others here have noted i closed this book after reading the last sentence three times rested my head in my hand and just thought it was a powerful book that i feel i should pick up and read again but this time starting with the second half to fully understand sean's story chronologically and maybe i will one day but even if i could trace the story itself more logically i couldn't get the real answer we all want why did he do it i think the beauty of wolf in white van is that so many of us i imagine tell ourselves our own versions of our lives and our motivations and we are not honest we have our escapes into our own heads or for many people here into the realities created by others we will never know what living inside another person's head is like but we can experience it in sean's story we can live another person's reality and see his escape and recognize parts of it as our own even if we don't listen to metal music read conan and send off for collectible sword catalogs others comment about wanting to know more about trace italian but i see it as a metaphor for life itself which i freely admit may be way too obvious and simple we all get dropped into it with the game already in play we choose our moves out of what are truly infinite possibilities but are in practice much more limited due to our perspectives we imagine and quest for an end we will never find and just continue to play slowly some deliberately some recklessly in a never ending series of moves until we decide to just stop or outside influences prevail the choices that chris and lance and carrie made resonate with sean because they reflect his own chris made the decision to end things himself lance and carrie were so into the game so lost in it and so needful of finding something meaningful to escape from their lives that they became immersed in it in real life although one thing that really bugs me as unresolved in the book is what was the thought sean had after reading lance's comment about having nothing to do in his town during the summer that sean felt too shameful to write it down we learn not much later that sean also had thoughts about his own summers being uneventful and know what happened shortly after but i'm still uncertain what his thoughts were this is a novel that some will hate because it doesn't just tell you everything and tie things up with neat explanations but some will love it for the same reasons because that is life and reading this book is experiencing someone else's life i personally thought it was moving i must say on a personal level i could relate to sean his feelings of an accepted loneliness of being an outcast but feeling normal when he was just in his own head and didn't see his reflection even his escape into a made up world if i had seen sean on the street i'd be someone who would have made eye contact and given a hopefully warm but not trying too hard smile i empathize i imagine what it is to be inside an exterior you don't want because i've been there too and i too have always known i will be lonely anyway","591":" john darnielle is best known as the front man and songwriter of indie folk band the mountain goats but his ability to write complex and intelligent prose is not just confined to writing music he is also a columnist and has previously published a novella wolf in white van is darnielle's debut novel and it has already been long listed for a national book award in the u s but despite this accolade the results are somewhat disappointing wolf in white van named after a satanic reference to song lyrics sees a disaffected youth named sean phillips go through a series of transformations these predominantly include becoming a disfigured recluse and an eventual \"other world\" master the story is told in reverse order and in a non linear way this means that it is only in the book's final pages that we learn of the events that caused phillips to become permanently disabled and disfigured the other major plot in the story sees phillips describing in long and often laborious detail how he created trace italian this is a fantasy role play game involving strategy and survival that is set in post apocalyptic america phillips devises the game whilst he is recovering in hospital from the traumatic incident trace italian is advertised in magazines so that would be players can write in in order to play the choose your own adventure style game the aim is to negotiate through a labyrinth of moves and events in order to reach the safe house that is buried deep inside the maze it is through trace italian that the loner phillips connects with the outside world he becomes close to two enthusiastic players but one day tragedy strikes after the pair take the game too seriously this results in death and it lands phillips with a lawsuit as the distressed families and friends want to ensure that the person responsible is held accountable wolf in white van is a mostly introspective tale that largely takes place inside phillips' head the text contains very little dialogue and live scenes this means there are often rather long and boring monologues about the confusing moves in the game and the different players the story is also quite cold and distant and at times it feels like it contains too much navel gazing another problem is that the book is supposed to be a suspense one but when both tragic events are revealed they are anti climactic and could use further explanation darnielle has attempted to write a dark and haunting novel in the vein of lionel shriver's we need to talk about kevin but ultimately this one just isn't as good as the latter masterpiece wolf in white van is an unsettling story but its methodical prose which coasts by neither forwards nor backwards just somewhere in the middle is too repetitive and elusive to really cut through darnielle's work shows promise and the concept is interesting enough but the execution lets it down too much is lost in translation making it impossible to truly grasp how this tragic aloof and disaffected teen never really grew up originally published on 2 december 2014 at the following website http www theaureview com arts books visit the au review's homepage at http www theaureview com","592":"i like the progress of hide and reveal in this one it takes a little bit for the reader to get the lay of the land and really get pulled in but the way that works in that one was one of the most interesting aspects for me i like a book that can tell me essentially everything pretty soon to the start and still have me not knowing what's going on the bulk of the book being devoted to finding that out especially when some things don't get completely answered not everything should be tied up in a neat little package it works well in this book and really kept my interest going it could have gone wrong really easily but it didn't i enjoyed it","593":"the story isn't bad but i found that there wasn't enough of it the trace italian was interesting but there wasn't enough of it i liked the slow reveal of the true details of the face disfiguring accident during the course of it though i kept wondering why i was reading it there seemed to be no point i also found the writing pretentious this review makes me sound mean","594":"i don't think one more review saying this book is amazing will matter since i think 10 out of 10 readers and critics agree but i will say it anyway john darnielle is an amazing writer and you should go read this right now","595":"humph i really really just don't know i will have to think on it a while","596":"maybe this just isn't my kind of book nothing really resonated while i found the premise intriguing the writing while accomplished never really connected with me","597":"phenomenal darnielle is a master of tension and unadulterated emotions this book is _not_ just for gamers don't let its premise fool you","598":"this book was absolutely amazing i was unsure when i picked it up but once i did i could not put it down the characters were well developed the environment is beautiful 5 stars","599":"full of some of the most beautiful writing i've ever come across magical","600":"1 john darnielle can write 2 as predicted i needed a hug afterward","601":" after listening to it pausing it several times to go back and listen to some passages lick my ears enough that it tickled my brain i had to buy this book to physically engage myself in the written form because i knew there was too much substance behind those words to simply listen to them i wanted to roll around in his writing it really is that good and that thought provoking i was always told that upon reading good literature and asked what the book was about the answer wouldn't be as easy as spewing off a sentence that encompasses the entire plot this book is a good example of that and i feel that also like good lit whoever you are when you read this book will ultimately define what this book is about let's just say that i had my teenage son read it after ordering it and we've since had several discussions over different phrases passages and whole characters and his take on the book is very different but at the same time just as awe induced as mine it will have you wanting to talk about it with someone else who read it wanting to know their thoughts on who he was before the gun shot to the head when is he his true self if ever what kind of life would he have had if he never picked up that gun on the first place what about the unintentional impact of his life on others what about the trial he is put through for having two teenagers lose their life by taking his game too seriously just read it","602":" i don't really know how to talk about this book but i loved it it captures beautifully the insecurities of adolescence as well as the pleasures of it darnielle also manages to explore the comfort and security of retreating to an inner life better than anyone i've read with the possible exception of haruki murakami as well as the price you pay for retreating without moralizing about it the novel's most remarkable accomplishments however are in sean's rare moments of magnificently poignant connection with other people the teenagers in the liquor store parking lot when kimmy holds sean's hand etc i sincerely hope he is close to finishing his next novel now","603":"johnny get your du0026amp d this would have made a solid short story it sputtered after the main reveals and repeated itself","604":"profoundly sad but remarkably resonant and told with a unique voice even knowing the place the plot was going and working backward many episodes offer potent revelations i sought out this first novel after hearing about the author on the judge john hodgman podcast","605":"expertly plotted and beautifully written","606":" i enjoyed but was not amazed by this novel the idea of a man who escapes into a text based game because of isolation from the outside world was interesting and i can see that the book would really appeal to readers with a background in tabletop gaming i guess my criticism of this book is that there wasn't much of a plot most of the action has already happened and is revealed to us through flashbacks maybe i was looking for just a little more plot overall though i did enjoy it it just wasn't my favorite i listened to this on audiobook","607":" wolf in white van made me ache it resonated in deeply personal ways that were tough to face head on but impossible to ignore john darnielle's writing is magnificent i love the mountain goats beyond measure so i experienced some hesitancy over whether the book could live up to my expectations but i needn't have worried as mesmerising as it is melancholy darnielle's words flow with a raw truth and honesty that's almost poetic in places our protagonist here is sean creator of a choose your own adventure game who was significantly disfigured at the age of seventeen events unfold slowly in near reverse to the point that the book may merit a repeat read back to front it begins ends on a hopeful note but also delves into some bleak places the characters are few but those who feature prominently dance around the idea of surrender as the ultimate success perpetual pointless foward motion being the only alternative sean's view of the world is often fragmented his memories of an uncertain nature he toys with the idea of splinter universes and imagined realities as an escape from the ordinary anyone who has ever spent a little too much time living inside their own mind can't fail to feel a kinship of sorts it's not only dungeons and dragons nerds who will understand the lure of sean's kingdom review originally published on my blog at line after line","608":" at first i thought this was just some angsty midlife crisis gen xer story i find myself pretty suspicious of books where the narrative jumps around in time so much but then i got to the explanation of trace italian and i was hooked this is more my thing a play by mail rpg seems so pretentious and it could have been just another retro thing but the world sean phillips presents to the reader is fascinating not necessarily in the detail but in how he has constructed everything he's created a sedate and undoubtedly addictive game but he intends no player to ever win in fact it seems like he has made it impossible to do so in the span of his life and that's just really intriguing to me from this bit of storytelling i was better able to relate to sean and the theme of the story the general meaningless of life and our own actions just showed through so strongly given how depressing this book is i can't see myself handing it over to someone for a recommendation but i'd certainly back up someone's decision to read the audiobook ready by the author himself is of a pretty good quality and i always love to hear how an author would read their work as you know you're getting each line exactly as they intended","609":"every time the mountain goats come on in my car which is often - i may be a little bit of an obsessive person whoops sam pats my dashboard and says \"oh john \" he's trying to make fun of me because if you pay attention to pretty much any song in their catalog at some point you'll find yourself saying the same thing - and i've been known to do it without even realizing it john is great john is emotional john is always fucking things up john's a mess i love john i wasn't sure he could pull off a novel though i've had limited experiences with lyricists i love writing novels - really just jost ritter's bright's passage which i actively disliked i love john and i love his lyrics but i just wasn't sure i wanted to spend hours and hours in his head as it turns out i do as it turns out john has got some serious chops all around wolf in a white van wasn't a \"mountain goats novel \" in which everyone is drunk all the time and making terrible decisions and feeling sad and defeated about it don't get me wrong - all of those things happened but there was also a very rich unique and affecting storyline underneath it all this book astounded me","610":"i'm not quite sure how i feel about this book but i liked it a little trippy","611":"not exactly a bad book in fact much of the writing was beautiful insightful or just plain funny but it was one of those where i got to the end and went really that's it","612":"it's tough to review wolf in white van so soon after finishing it i feel like the content of the story is going to stick around with me for a few more days weeks as i slowly process it it's not a fun read by any means but it is a good read and that matters more","613":"i loved the writing style but i was left with too many questions perhaps my rating will improve when i read it a second time because i have a feeling i'll need to i coincidentally finished this book on the same day i'm seeing the mountain goats in seattle","614":" this book was outstanding but i can see why some people dislike it the novel progresses in fragmented bits or information that for the first chapter leave you with a lot of questions the book is dark and really speaks the most to people who themselves struggled to find a place in the world i think everyone who works with teenagers will find the book griping and perpetually timely it took me back to the first time reading cannery row it's bright and dark but leaves you feel sad and an remorseful in some strange way i will probably end up reading it again","615":"i'd probably give this 3 5 stars overall for character development leaving us in suspense on key details and slowly sharing them as the book unfolds","616":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here darnielle is as always a masterful writer and storyteller here and the way he shifts between time periods and weaves through memories is a natural seamless flow of thoughts the book is like no other i've read and i only shy from giving it 5 stars because we don't learn much about the motivation that lead to his life changing event i arrived at the end and felt let down after so much build up","617":"sorry to be a bit cliched but this book has some crazily masterful prose going on masterful prose plus an excellent story equals that feeling of being enveloped by a book like you're under the covers or submerged in the ocean or inside of an envelope or something recommend","618":"i wasn't all that excited to read this book but it turned out to be very good it's not a happy book but it's intriguing and definitely pulls you in even though there's not much action","619":"i really wanted to like this book but it was not what i expected at all i didn't connect with the main character and i kept waiting for something more to happen","620":" a very dark novel written from the perspective of a disfigured adult reflecting on the events in his life that led him to where he is today author of a mail in dystopian role playing game the chapters in the book move between his childhood his teenage years and two major incidents in his life hard to explain more without spoiling anything as much of what makes this a great novel is the pacing and reveal really moving novel i only wish there was more of the role playing game it just seems so interesting","621":" this book was a gift from my university friends and despite not being very intrigued by the summary i decided to give it a try and step out of my comfort zone but i didn't like it i didn't like sean even though you should feel pity for him for me it wasn't a likeable character and couldn't relate to his loneliness and dark thoughts the way is written is not appealing to me the constant stream of thoughts and dreams jumping back and forth in time felt hard to keep up with in the end it took me months to finish this book because i wasn't interested in the story and maybe it is because i can't relate to the memorabilia and nostalgia","622":"there's only one place this road ever ends up the mountain goats","623":" feeling a little confused and a lot disappointed in this book i will say the writing feels poetic but the best way i can describe this book is stream of consciousness i feel like it was lacking in plot and was full of extraneous information that added nothing to the story and this was a short book i expected every word to count i am also a bit baffled by so many other positive reviews and the nomination for the national book award i'll say it's a decent read but not at all what i was expecting and not in a good way also was i the only one expecting something slightly similar to ready player one based on the synopsis","624":" i was all set to give this book two stars until the very end when it plunged itself decisively into one star territory this book does not make sense there is no plot to speak of information about the main character is given out sparingly i was a chapter or so in before i knew the main character's gender that seems to be the main hook of the book some incredibly traumatic thing happened to the main character and information about that and the rest of his life is doled out ever so incrementally over the whole book until you reach the end where the big payoff is supposed to be where you're supposed to find out exactly what happened and why and there's absolutely no explanation the words are there explaining what happened but they don't make any connection to how human beings think or act i truly don't get it the trace italian was kind of interesting but not enough to redeem the rest of the book","625":"it's sad scary and pitch perfect this is about a guy who runs a play by mail role playing game this is the least self indulgent thing you could expect for what it's really about best read not knowing any other plot points if you can help it","626":" forever is a question you start asking when you look at the ceiling it becomes a word you hear in the same way that people who associate sound with color might hear a flat sky blue the open sky through which forgotten satellites travel forever this book gave my inner angsty confused and hurt teenage self some kind of inner peace not in a remarkable way but in a comforting way it was an easy read however in no way light with some great observations about human tendencies i will definitely read this again","627":"i was the asshole weeping on the bus reading this almost every page had some unrepentant horrifying bleak devastating tiny moment of truth that caused me to gasp or wince or cover my mouth just oh i knew it was going to be good it could have been john darnielle's grocery list and it still would have wrecked me but it was unbearably brilliant sad and beautiful the hideousness of being alive and alone this book is so much i wish i'd had it a year ago or two or seven i don't know but i'm glad it's around now and i'm so glad i stayed alive long enough to read it","628":"i finished this book the same day i watched the film adaptation of the way more hokey tome the fault in our stars in the movie and probably the book too there's a line that goes something like that's the thing about pain it demands to be felt this is an unsettling book that expertly piles on the pain and demands that you feel it naturally i really enjoyed it","629":"this is another one of those books where i felt compelled to read every word because the writing was captivating and dense but i'm not sure the format of the story works essentially moving backward in time to the accident that disfigures the narrator it felt a bit like that was supposed to be a shocking reveal but instead because the information comes so late although highly hinted at and easily guessable it's more irritating all the prose is permeated by an intense almost oppressive loneliness of a very specific familiar archetype the lonely nerd boy teen seen from the view of his older self one of the frustrating parts about the book is that you never really understand what was going through teenage sean's mind leading up to the moments of the accident and perhaps present sean doesn't either but that distance despite the first person narration and the long meandering passages about memory and how this pivotal event impacted his life means that we never really come to know sean and he doesn't transform into a fully developed person i'm not sure i would've ever picked up the book if it hadn't gotten so much press although the narrator is far beyond his teenage years the story flips back and forth in past and present and it's almost as if the accident around which the novel revolves traps him in some sort of stasis so he still feels remarkably teenaged i really enjoyed the examinations of memory that weave throughout the book what memories are true what are not how the narrative we create with our memories is far more important than what actually happened","630":"no spoilers below warning for interested readers that there are triggers throughout regarding suicide and self harm and there's not really any getting around them this was much like darnielle's songwriting introspective dark and touched by the cynicism of a society who has allowed the fringes to be abandoned i related to this book in many ways an outsider crafting a fantasy world as means to find peace and purpose the feeling of pride in creating feeling alone and apart from the greater community the premise was interesting and the narrative approach was challenging i enjoyed this though the state of the main character was difficult to read at times","631":"i feel like this book never really got off the ground there was so much potential for it to be fleshed out and filled in but entirely too much is left unsaid maybe that's the point because what happens to sean is incomprehensible but by the same token i'd have enjoyed this more if the ending hadn't been so abrupt","632":"aren't we all playing a version of trace italian gather clues and make your move","633":" how can something this psychologically heavy be such a breezy read well breezy is really not the right word for this this was creepy and smooth and absorbing and cold like riding a waterslide in the dark what hooked me was the text based dystopian role playing game that sean invented in his mind while he recovered in the hospital from an incident with a gun he gives us behind the scenes glimpses and excerpts of the game throughout the novel nerd self activated i'd like to play something like this please people who sign up for the game send in their choices by mail and wait for the next turn to be sent out to them good players play on for years surviving many dangers getting ever closer to the goal of the game find the fortress of the trace italian gain entry and finally find safety in this horrifying post apocalyptic world but as sean acknowledges early on no player will ever reach this goal the inside of the trace italian of course does not exist a player can get close enough to see it it shines in the new deserts of kansas gleaming in the sun or starkly rising from the winter cold the rock walls that protect it meet in points around it one giving way to another for days on end but the dungeons into which you'll fall as you work through the pathways to its gates number in the low hundreds and if you actually get into the entry hall there are a few hundred more sub dungeons before you'll actually reach somewhere that's truly safe technically it's possible to get to the last room in the final chamber of the trace italian but no one will ever do it no one will ever live that long some of the players take the game so seriously that they put themselves in real life danger and sean and readers have to confront a series of troubling moral questions oddly though that aspect of the story is not so compelling it is sean's mind that is interesting and what lies hidden there burdening him in ways he strives to cope with sean's first person narration circles around in time picking up and dropping threads of two clear periods shortly before and years after the horrible incident that left him terribly disfigured giving readers calibrated pieces of information to help us approach but never reach understanding of that incident itself much like his players never reach the trace italian sean's psychology is full of twists and hidden corners that he has learned it is best not to talk about so even with his relatively open and earnest first person perspective as a guide we cannot see the whole map or find the center","634":" so i struggled with this book i wanted to like it and in fact i found the writing to be well done often beautiful however i did not really enjoy it one of the biggest issues i had was the constant jumping around on the timeline this story jumps all over main character sean's life from junior high to present day also there seems to be 3 major story arcs that we are following sean's arc that details how he came to be disfigured as a teen the arc of players lance and carrie and then the arc of player chris haynes however like with the timeline the story jumps from arc to arc and there is no preparation for the reader often i found myself lost for a few sentences as to when in the life of sean i was it seemed like darnielle was trying his darndest to be as enigmatic as possible and it just made the book seem like a hot mess to me i know that a lot of people found this book to be amazing and i'm not saying it couldn't be an amazing books for many people however it was not amazing for me perhaps i just don't get it i don't know","635":"interesting and i liked it more as i went on but some of darnielle's characterization seemed a little too forced and the central traumas the book circles around are both too horrifying to be revealed in the way they are and somehow not horrifying enough it works but it didn't wow me","636":"if you follow darnielle's work with the mountain goats the humanity he has in his lyrics is here as is his love of metal and his previous career as a nurse the story is structured around a turn based strategy game which frankly i have never given a crap about but that's just a structure in place to weave a story about the protagonist's disfiguring accident which is told in reverse i admit i didn't really get the ending understanding what caused the accident the why it's hinted at and i got the hints but up to you to decide to accept it kinda like turn based strategy games","637":"i'm so glad that john darnielle himself read this audiobook there are rhythms in the writing he emphasizes which i don't think a different narrator would've great book and one that i'm passing along to my daughter this may well be the second book this year the indian by jon gnarr being the other that we both read and enjoy","638":" throughout my time reading this book i felt a sense of mental resonance so intense that it was almost a physical sensation gripping troubling enriching engrossing a large part of me wants to turn from the last page directly back to the first wrapping it in overlapping layers across my mind until i can finally see the whole of it instead of that i'll do something else for a while take a break that's not much of a review but there it is anyway more superficially i just really want to play trace italian","639":"there's a sort of multi level challenge involved with a first person narrator like darnielle's sean phillips first is the more simple task of following the story or stories that he's presenting simply being sure that you've assembled the fragmented narrative properly understanding the order of events and seeing in simple jigsaw puzzle fashion that it's fit together at least as well as the text allows but then there's the question of whether you're picking up the hints and clues that reveal what the events signify to the narrator everything seems to be related in a voice that's calm and straightforward even when talking about something as painful and difficult as rehab from blowing off part of your own face there must be a layer of feeling underneath the dissociation right and as you search you have the question of the narrator's reliability hovering over your shoulder leaving you wondering at every turn which pieces are trustworthy and which are badly distorted by ten years of a strange and isolated life there is a certain amount of plot in wolf in white van but it's almost beside the point this is primarily a portrait it's the self depiction of someone whose childhood and youth seem almost entirely isolated but not by design by geography or cruelty but by the accidents of society and personality that made it possible to be a kid in small town suburban usa in the late 20th century and still be cut off from much in the way of genuine human interaction in the end i think i set my expectations badly hoping to find a sort of key that would unlock the black box that contains the accident as sean calls it several times i don't think i found it it's entirely likely that i'm an insufficiently careful or insightful reader but it also seems true to me that the box is also closed to sean and there's only so much the reader can see where the narrator will not or cannot look","640":"brief and narrow but elliptical the maze motif on the cover and the name given to the narrator's game is not incidental to the book low key and kind of mantra like and full of beautifully chosen words and phrases the deliberate nature of darnielle's book mirrors the gm role sean plays in his life analytic and predictable without losing emotional impact as in all good games","641":"i didn't know what to expect from this novel having read ready player one and snow crash but it couldn't have been more different it was devastating it was hard to read at certain points but you couldn't help but go on i don't want to give anything away but this is not some fast paced thriller but something much deeper somber sobering and lyrical and i don't throw that out lightly because the author is the songwriter for the mountain goats this novel gets under your skin the way it gets under the chacter's skin and how we have to live in those skins starts out as one thing and becomes quite another a good read for a rainy sunday afternoon hope he writes more novels","642":"unsettling beautiful and really intense in a way that sort of sneaks up on you i felt dazed upon finishing it like i'd been through an experience a breathtaking sort of journey i don't think i'll entirely grasp until i process it for another month or so","643":"great writing not a lot of plot but that's not really what this book is about","644":"this book has a strange rhythm and is hard to get invested into finally around chapter 9 i started to understand what the author was portraying but i still found it strange but intriguing and somewhat poetic i started to care about the main character but then the ending killed whatever hope i had for making sense of the whole story i kind of 'get it' but i still feel like some key information is missing for me to have a full understanding of what actually happened or maybe that's the point","645":"this novel takes readers inside the mind of a high school loner he prefers his fantasy world to real life the novel flips back and forth from his high school mind to his adult self you learn early on that he has been horribly disfigured in a way that makes people not want to look at him learning the nature and cause of this kept me reading some good writing here","646":" i was prepared to really like this book from the description it sounded like something i would be really into the d and d ish aspects werereally cool but that was about all that drew me into the book the narrator had such a confusing mindset that just when you thought you would agree with him on something he would change it around making him really frustrating i'm still not sure what i was supposed to take away from that book the build up to find out what actually happened to him was shocking but was obviously trying to be shocking which made it annoying","647":" i heard an interview with john darnielle and loved the storytelling in his music so really wanted to give his book a try i sort of enjoyed the book and appreciated the author's reading of it in the audible format at first upon finishing it i was frustrated wanted more of an ending expected more of a story that's one of the downsides about audible and kindle books is not being able to judge the length easily the way you can when you're holding a light book or a heavy one this one was relatively short 5 hours 22 minutes and i was surprised when i got to the end like wait a minute that's it i had trouble with the main character's motivation and rationale for the decision he made that is central to the plot in the end i just tried to think of the book as a sort of riff on a concept the author had and played out in the book","648":"this one was challenging full of interesting interior details and experiences the action most of which happens in the past is revealed slowly teasingly through commentary from the narrator so that we're never quite sure exactly what happened until we're right near the end this one will leave you affected long after you finish it","649":"had big expectations about the book but it lost me at the end","650":"so i was desperate for a good audiobook something to do while both hands are occupied feeding my daughter a bottle i searched and searched and finally a book jumped out at me the description had phrases like game of strategy text based roleplaying game played through the mail and unfolds in reverse heck yes sounds like my kind of book only then did i glance at the author's name that's funny this author has the same name as the lead singer songwriter of the mountain goats one of my all time favorite bands so i pull up wikipedia and wouldn't you know i guess i just don't pay enough attention u0026gt u0026lt i then really wanted the book to be good and whew i wasn't disappointed this is a dark and moody book mysterious and poetic i'm glad i listened to the audiobook to hear the author read his own words because i'm guessing it made it easier to follow along with those descriptive internal passages this is not one of those feel good books that uses nerd culture for charm instead it's a deep and unsettling pause a look at something broken i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is drawn in by the plot summary and or reviews","651":"interesting and difficult to predict but not truly notable the writing style is typical contemporary conversationalese","652":"this would almost be one of those examples of books where i can't tell if i like the book because i can hear the author's voice in my head but the story is engaging and melancholy and desolate and sad because there are so many seans in this world","653":"dark u0026amp interesting the ending was a little anticlimactic but that kind of fits the story","654":"honestly not entirely sure what to make of this one","655":"if you like the mountain goats odds are good you'll like this and conversely if you liked this you should probably check out the mountain goats the plot wasn't particularly gripping the story is told backwards after all but the narrator was an interesting character in a very darniellean way","656":" just couldn't quite get into this one wolf in white van is the story of a seventeen year old who lives in isolation behind the game that has somewhat replaced his identity picking up fans and becoming with time almost uncomfortably realistic sean's voice and point of view are essential to this novel and the combination of self pity and ambition is one that rings true is dramatic and compelling i think though what didn't work for me was the structure of the novel as it withholds the climax and sean's core memory until the end as a result i found myself questioning much of what was happening consistently trying to link up the dots along the way only to find myself continually confused i nevertheless enjoyed the discussion of the truth versus the virtual and the ethical implications involved","657":"really liked this book and its unique subject matter a lot highly recommended","658":"gushed about on a little literary podcast as the newest greatness i went in and thought not so but perchance a 4 before the half re so lute ly 3 ed","659":" this was a masterful work from darnielle i'm not writing a whole review because honestly it's a book that requires multiple readings to really appreciate there's something really dark and twisted underneath this character and it never quite reaches the surface but i think that's the intent of this character there are also twinges of mental illness and that feels like an odd duality to explore is this character a monster or is he struggling with a deep illness i do wish the alternative reality sean developed and lived through his players had been more developed in the second half of the book but i understand why it disappeared the alternative structure was a little difficult to follow at times but i see this more as a challenge than a problem by disrupting our usual thinking pattern darnielle allows us to enter the disruptions sean experiences in his life i highly recommend this book and i will probably read it again after a few months to see if i understand it at a new level","660":"the format of this novel makes it hard to follow the main character sean is left with an extreme facial deformity after a tragic incident who is to blame for this incident we never fully find out but are left floundering about in sean's mind which alternates between past present and fantasy","661":"this book got under my skin like nothing i've ever read it was incredibly unsettling and absolutely amazing on my list of all time bests","662":" my ratings are based on an inconsistent mishmash of my emotional reaction to books and my opinion of the technical skill it took to actually pull them off in this case i'm at about a two star rating for enjoyability of feels invoked and a four star rating for wow this dude has skills so three stars it is if you were a weird lonely teenager who fled daily life into escapism and occasionally had uncomfortable and destructive impulses this novel will probably speak to you you should consider whether you want to listen","663":" intrusive thoughts we all have them these are those thoughts that come to us seemingly at random and from out of nowhere that involve things that we would normally find disturbing harming or even killing those we love for instance or destroying some cherished object or perhaps even our own destruction \"what would happen if i ran the car off the road \" \"i'd like nothing more than to set this house on fire with everyone in it \"\"maybe i should drop this dog from the balcony \"most of the time one can brush these thoughts off recognise them as nothing more than an irritation and move on some people however particularly those with mental health problems like ocd depression and anxiety disorders might not be able to brush those thoughts aside so easily they may turn into obsessions become a source of anxiety or maybe just maybe they might be encouraged to act upon them this was one of the things that occurred to me when i finished reading wolf in white van by john darnielle it is the story of sean phillips who suffered a horrific injury that did great damage to his face while recovering from his injury he created a game called trace italian a mail in roleplaying game set in a dystopian post apocalyptic united states however when two people are found dead in the kansas wilderness and evidence leads the police to sean's doorstep sean is forced to defend his game and himself all the while reminiscing on the events that led him to where he is now when hope first threw this book at me it was mostly because of the style and the gaming references i have to admit she was right darnielle's style of writing is very interesting as is the concept of the trace italian i'm especially fond of the latter because it's the sort of game i would enjoy playing but i know of no such games running in my country and i suppose there's a reason for that given how terrible the postal service is here and i agree with hope that this sort of game must be played via snail mail otherwise it loses its appeal as for sean himself he's quite intriguing and the reader gets to know him gradually over the course of the novel the mystery of course is what happened to give him that disfiguring injury i like the way this aspect of the novel was played out particularly for the way the injury shaped sean's life as well as his responses to those who see it i can't say for certain whether or not darnielle knew or knows anyone who has had to suffer from a similar kind of trauma to what sean suffers but i like the way sean's characterisation offers insight into what it must be like to under go something that so utterly and completely changes one's life at the most fundamental level take for instance sean's parents it is implied throughout the course of the book that they do things that aren't necessarily conducive to sean's emotional and mental recovery or at least sean himself suggests they do so but he is ever and always forgiving of them aware that they react the way they do because they don't know what's going on in sean's head perhaps never really attempted to do so or when sean tried to help them understand they themselves withdrew either from confusion or simple lack of will to see what sean wanted them to see this was the aspect of sean's story that i was drawn to most i was able to relate to my sean's inability to truly express himself to his parents who simply watched him and let him do as he pleased without truly understanding why he did what he did my own parents are similar to a degree and sometimes i wonder if acting out truly acting out doing something so utterly completely radical would get them to sit up and ask \"why \" view spoiler sean's own supreme act of \"acting out\" an event explained at the end an event that resulted in giving him the injury mentioned throughout the course of the novel is extreme to be sure too extreme for me but it does illustrate the kind of pressure he was under a pressure that is explained throughout the novel and which reaches a head at the end i read it as a cry not for help but for understanding for someone to look at oneself and nod and say \"i understand\" a comprehension at the very least of what is going on in one's head an acceptance of it even if the other doesn't necessarily agree with it hide spoiler these are obviously rather dark thoughts and i think that's the whole point of this novel or at least one of its points sean's mind is a labyrinth very much like the trace italian and it is only by carefully sifting through the paths of his memory for which his game is a metaphor that he can answer the question \"why \" it's not a straightforward answer far from it but it's there it just takes time to reach it but even then even after all that hard work it's possible that one gets no answer at all just like the trace italian has no real end even sean is aware that the true answer to the question \"why \" was and always has been \"i don't know\" an inconclusive answer just as the trace italian is an inconclusive game for all that though for all that the above would normally be an interesting thing for me would actually rather please me as a story there's something that doesn't quite sit well with me about this novel it could be that i didn't like the thoughts it made me think the paths it took me down in terms of my own memories and thoughts but i can deal with that to a degree i suppose it feels as if something vital is missing about this novel some beating heart some throbbing soul that i think should be there but just isn't not even the gaming references not even the quality of darnielle's prose could make me believe that this novel was alive that it had a pulse that it breathed or it could be that it's simply not to my taste that's always a distinct possibility overall wolf in white van is a potentially interesting novel but it is most certainly not to everybody's tastes i'm sure there's a reason why this novel is so highly praised why so many people love it but for my part i simply can't find myself to love it it contains so many of the elements i enjoy in a novel but it appears to be missing some specific vital spark to it that would allow me to embrace it wholeheartedly and love it as so many other people seem to perhaps it is simply put not for me","664":"better than i thought it would be and almost as richly textured as a mountain goats song almost but i couldn't help but wonder why darnielle wrote a whole book just to reiterate the same message over and over i liked the concept that everything we do is and isn't imbued with our past decisions and context but i didn't need to be so saturated in it","665":" this was a book i purchased the day of its release read five pages of and then forgot about until the girlfriend and i were sitting on her parents couch lat week weathering through a chicago snow i flipped back to the start and began again wolf in white van is the story of well the lead's name isn't exactly a spoiler but as it isn't revealed until much later on in the text i won't give it away our protagonist is game designer who suffered an undisclosed incident in his youth which radically altered his physical appearance and something terrible has happened to two players of his play by mail rpg there's really not much more about the specifics of plot or really story that i'd feel comfortable divulging it's really a story that just needs to be experienced by a willing reader as opposed to an unwilling one the text is part diary part memoir part fever dream jumping around the narrator's life from his childhood his adult isolation and the terrible event that forced him to create his game there's a lot to appreciate for one darnielle has a more than apt command of the english language you'd almost think he's got it trained to do his bidding for treats and head pats the world our narrator lives is a lonely one and as readers we're isolated from it by nature of its stark ordinariness and the world within our narrator's mind the one we see expressed via the impossible game he's been conducting over the decades pairs with the abject loneliness loss and malformation of identity our lead carries with him that might've been the hardest bit for me to take in personally as the characters struggles in his teenage years immediately brought me back to my own teenage sadness misery and ideation towards annihilation there should be a hope in the notion that you can come through the other side stronger and making a real lasting change in the world but there isn't and anyone who was miserable as a teenager would know that if you could pop back in time to 16 year old you and tell them to chillax they'd tell you to fuck off and go out and do something obscene there is real lightness to the narrative besides a sort relief you feel at the end of the story when you get to the moment of the horrible u0026amp irrversible act and think this is when the main character is born here they come i'm sorry there is also i guess on a brighter side a dialog on game design woven throughout the course of the text as i've become deeply interested in rpgs as of late my girlfriend ascertained correctly that it's because i can't bring myself to fail at writing fiction any longer i found particularly compelling there is of course a cruelty in designing a game that cannot be won one that seems to have existed for as long as humans have been pitting themselves against constructed challenges but the virtue it seems to be in the construction of the dungeon itself design it so that if players get far enough they they they've failed in some way missed out on something made a wrong choice don't hint that there was no choice to be made at all which i suppose is what the structured the narrative itself is arguing","666":" i'm not sure what to think about this book it's interesting but it seems like something that demands a reread to really understand and i don't think i want to spend any more time in the main character's head it follows a guy who suffered a disfiguring accident as a teenager and as an adult he lives a fairly reclusive life making a living by operating a play by mail role playing game we gradually learn that there has been a tragedy involving a couple players of the game and the story slowly moves back in time as he reflects on his life he seems like a normal if kind of odd guy at the beginning but as the story goes on we get into his head more and more and he seems like he might be kind of a sociopath which sort of colors what seems like innocence early on this is why going back and reading the beginning with knowledge or at least inference of who this guy really is may bring new light on his current state but i didn't find him compelling enough to really want to do so still it's an interesting headspace to occupy and it's a fairly quick read so it's not a waste of time by any means i just wasn't especially satisfied by the experience as a whole","667":"i thought i would become less confused as the book progressed but i was still left with questions marks above my head loved the protagonist though and the ending","668":"awful annoying difficult to read unless you grew up hiding under a table to avoid interacting with people don't bother this book is no fun and has no redeeming content","669":"well written creatively told story but not one i would recommend while i enjoy weirdness this one didn't have enough meat to the story to rate any higher","670":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here so i can't say i enjoyed this book i don't mind a non linear story when it is done in an interesting way but when it was mixed between reality and fantasy it became so hard to follow that i stopped caring about the book this may have been a bit of fault based on listening to it as an audio book maybe it is easier to follow in text i didn't dock it too much for this i'd say half a star because this was 1 a personal issue and 2 maybe not an issue in text format the big reason i rate it t so i can't say i enjoyed this book i don't mind a non linear story when it is done in an interesting way but when it was mixed between reality and fantasy it became so hard to follow that i stopped caring about the book this may have been a bit of fault based on listening to it as an audio book maybe it is easier to follow in text i didn't dock it too much for this i'd say half a star because this was 1 a personal issue and 2 maybe not an issue in text format the big reason i rate it three stars is the premise overall letting me down i picked this up because the book flap explanation is that this fantasy world comes crashing down because some idiot kids take it too seriously yet these idiot kids are barely even a presence in the book it sort of describes that they were cold and hiding in some hole and one of them died but that's really it i wanted the story to be more about them tbh this book would've been really great if we watched as sean read their moves only to later find out they really were doing the stuff maybe more than just being stupid and getting themselves killed maybe they are making turns where they kill mutants then sean starts seeing stories about murders and they sound familiar play it into his decision to blab or keep watching their story unfold that could be tied into the back story about his suicide attempt and how it affects his ability to separate the reality from the fantasy even when he is watching it happen idk i'm just disappointed i guess i jumped in for a story about a game gone wrong with an intriguing narrator and instead i got the ramblings of a post suicide attempt in broken timeline fantasy reality with little to no bearing on the idiot kids court case more","671":" i'm not going to mention darnielle the singer in this review just darnielle the novelist so overall this is a pretty solid book and very well executed in my opinion the strange thing is that it's surprisingly avant garde given that there isn't any traditional story structure it's heavily thematic and much of the story is in the unsaid or implied these are the book's best features one would assume that darnielle is trying to polemicize entertainment as something which may or may not be insidiously destructive satanic messages style which is what the title of the book refers to but he's not out to make such a trivial point what the book manages to say in this regard is one of the most insightful takes on the aforementioned polemic i've ever read and darnielle achieves this humbly by letting you come to his conclusions yourself based on his artful juxtaposition of a series of notions you might be too familiar and comfortable with it's like that george orwell quote the best books are the ones that tell you what you know already in this case the book shows us what we should have realized about the nature of lies we tell ourselves on the sentence level darnielle proves himself to be a good ventriloquist for the main character there wasn't a moment i felt sean break character which unfortunately it more than i can say for a few of the peripheral characters at first i got annoyed with the text's over saturation with metaphors and passages from his little rpg trace italian until i realized their relation to the book's overall themes then i found myself really appreciating them towards the center of the book though darnielle gets a little too enamored with colons and semicolons also there are parts of the book that are written in such abstract language that the message of those passages can be lost if you're not paying very very close attention and these passages appear without warning","672":"from www pingwings ca i totally love this book's cover i also love that the book is only a coupe hundred pages as i was able to read it in a day this is one of those books that has a plot of sorts but nothing much seems to happen sometimes i like books like that sometimes i don't in this case i did i also liked the way the story is told in a way that moves back and forth in time coming to a certain point by the end that is connected to everything else that has happened i'm not sure how to talk about this book but i really liked the writing the idea of the trace italian the darkness of the story and i thought a lot about it once i finished reading recommended","673":"after a disfiguring injury sean phillips isolates himself from the rest of humanity his only connection is made through a strategy game he runs for strangers through the mail then something bad happens to two players and questions about sean's responsibility are raised this story explores what it means to be a social outcast this is a short book that takes a few chapters to take off but when it does it becomes mesmerizing the plot is a mix of sean past the present court case and sean's game descriptions this story is incredibly short for how affecting it is","674":"wow what a read this book will stick with you for a long time i really enjoyed the plot unreeling backwards","675":"after finishing the book i had a question about something i read at the beginning so i started again and found myself a third of the way through again without really meaning to keep going such is this book for me it feels elegiac cryptic and moody and yet i was completely drawn in to the young narrator's interior life i'd give it 3 1 2 stars despite its very strangeness the novel seems pulled from reality what kind of adolescence did mr darnielle have not a beach read i'm glad i read it but would not know who to recommend it to in the interests of full disclosure i have heard two mountain goats songs i liked one of them","676":"this review contains spoilers read this review and more at www keepcalmandreadon netopening to the first page of wolf in white van by john darnielle was rather intimidating the book has been very well received and is considered by most to b a literary achievement of it's time coming to a book like this is like visiting disney world for the first time and asking yourself the dreaded question will it live up to the hype fortunately this book can breathe a sigh of relief as it not only lives up to the hype but exceeds all expectations in what a book is meant to be this book is the lobster platter that is so delectable that it makes it hard to eat anything else for a few days of course there will be other gourmet reads out there that can be enjoyed just the same and may top this but what this book has achieved is a rare thing it should be savored wolf in white van tells the story of sean a game designer whose disfigured face keeps him from living a normal life the game he designed titled trace italian is a play by mail role playing game which is under scrutiny because some players took the game a bit too seriously and came to some harm because of it the narrative takes a unique approach by telling it's story in reverse there are many reasons why i love this book but three things are stand out that really elevate this book to another level first off the main character's characterization growth and narrative voice were all fantastic right from the get go sean intrigued me and pulled me into his reality he isn't perfect far from it instead he is honest and to be fair practically every first person narrator is honest to a point but sean carried a narrative voice that was raw without being cliche his narration also was very unique to what was going on in his life and reflected his circumstances his growth wasn't particularly apparent right away but once you have a grasp of how the story is being told it becomes much stronger it has been said that sean is a great study of bestiality in reviews i have read and i can concur with this statement similar to folklore and fairy tales like beauty and the beast sean's character and appearance have a very romantic quality to them that enchants the reader and really shines in darnielle's writing style overall the main character is solid and really well crafted another great aspect of this novel was the author's voice beyond the character darnielle gave words to the seemingly wordless everyday aspects of life i once read a book where the author spoke of this beautiful woodland scene only to then say that it was too beautiful to put into words that is called lazy writing and there is none of that in this book it is the job of the author to put words to the mundane or seemingly wordless elements of life darnielle succeeds in this area on so many levels there is a scene where sean visits a liquor store and some teenage boys stop him to ask about his disfigured face darnielle writes about what we understand about body language and comradery that often is registered in our brains but not processed completely through words it's the most natural and invisible aspects of life that are painted the most poignant in this book finally this book would not resonate with me nearly as much if it weren't for the artistry that is invoked to tell a story something of great importance when it comes to storytelling is that a book is merely the skin a story wears stories can wear many skins they can be songs or poems or films or photographs darnielle has experience with storytelling via a song the book jacket labels him as one of the best lyricists of his generation if you weren't aware darnielle is the lead writer composer guitarist and vocalist for a band called the mountain goats i've never really been attentive to the band though have recently previewed a few tracks and from what i have heard darnielle does have a narrative style about him in his music in other words darnielle knows how to tell a good story it became obvious that this was written by someone who is primarily a songwriter about two thirds into this book and is the sole reason i consider the book to be a favorite realizing the intricacies and the abstract way of revealing a narrative reminded me of listening to a really good song this is why i love the book it is like a puzzle that can be solved multiple ways and it is beautiful obviously i am veering into spoiler territory when i say that the narrative is told in reverse and this style is just beautiful and brilliant i can't say it enough do i like wolf in white van no i love it and i know it is cliche to word it like that but it is the truth this book is getting 5 out of 5 stars from me","677":"well written but disappointing the ending doesn't deliver any big reveal which i was expecting","678":"i wanted to like it more","679":"i really did enjoy this book although it challenged the limits of my empathy towards characters most of it was a fascinating perspective from an isolated person's life of solitude and coping with a disfiguring injury the worlds in his imagination are intricately entertaining however there were parts that were very difficult to read or listen to on audio but they were still told in such a gripping way that i couldn't put it down","680":"wait what i need to think about this for a day or two","681":" from kalireads com but at that moment all i could see was the wolf in the white van so alive so strong hidden from view unnoticed concealed and i thought maybe he's real this wolf and he's really out there in a white van somewhere riding around maybe he's in the far back pacing back and forth circling the pads of his huge paws raw and cracking his thick sharp claws dully clicking against the raised rusty steel track ridges on the floor maybe he's sound asleep or maybe he's just pretending and then the van stops somewhere maybe and somebody gets out and walks around the side to the back and grabs hold of the handle and flings the doors open wide maybe whoever's kept him wears a mechanic's jumpsuit and some sunglasses and he hasn't fed the great wolf for weeks cruising the streets of the city at night and the wolf's crazy with hunger now he can't even think maybe he's not locked up in the back at all he could be riding in the passenger seat like a dog just sitting and staring out the open window looking around checking everybody out maybe he's over in the other seat behind the steering wheel maybe he's driving -john darnielle wolf in white vansean phillips the disfigured narrator of john darnielle's highly buzzed about first novel wolf in white van pushes said wolf in said white van into possible existence when young a boy with an imagination capable of hijacking reality young sean watches tv at all hours eyes glazed seeking \"a sort of shelter \" after all the other networks have gone down late at night the christian network stays on and sean stays glued learning about how some rock music when played backwards plays satanic messages satanic messages like the simple ominous unclear \"wolf in white van \"darnielle has crafted this short shocking novel with care he's built it just like one of those bewitched rock songs which contains a hungry wolf when played backwards less deft prose would crash this book here the story you come to understand is something overwhelmingly large almost repulsive but so often not talked about in this deliberate compassionate way sean phillips is imaginative above all else game and fantasy focused after a disfiguring accident incident in high school he's become a complete social isolate living reclusively to avoid scaring people with his marred face he directs players through the post nuclear meltdown world of trace italian his mail based role playing game the game sounds amazing and seems to be much more clear and simple to sean than the real world few manufactured landscapes are as foreign to me as the terrain of the angry adolescent male's mind so inexplicable i can't even make generalizations about it here maybe this is why some of the most powerful books i've read attempt to take on this frontier so often dropped from our cultural narrative as we focus on the sexualization of young girls what about young guys these days russell banks's lost memory of skin introduced a young man so disconnected from physical contact so plugged into chat rooms and visual delight that he didn't yet have the mental acuity to realize when he stumbled into a 'to catch a predator' like trap dave cullen's columbine revealed disconnected kids totally lost inside their own minds fueled by fantasy much more than anything around them not bullied not trench coat mafioso but hormone laden romantic and imaginative guys who romanced their deaths into something worth doing wolf in white van joins this group if books offer us understanding a mainline into another's thought process then the most powerful books are the ones in which we find ourselves page by page understanding those among us that seem the least human the least comprehensible what begins as a possibly sympathetic story of a man with a disfiguring injury evolves into a story with so many flashes of dissonance that the text seems to shift around you and you realize you have possibly been empathizing with or sympathizing for a monster or look at things a different way and you realize monstrous acts are always committed by struggling humans trying to keep their own dark wolves in control navigating mazes of problem and solution deep within their own minds sean explains at one point \"some lessons you learn gradually and some you learn in a sudden moment like a flash going off in a dark room \" darnielle teaches in both ways here building to a moment the reader knows is coming but stuns all the same i'm not going to say too much about plot other than that if you'd like to know all the details the reviews revealing them are out there wolf in white van has already received a national book award nomination and i don't think this is the last we'll hear about this little book","682":"lyrical as all fuck this is exactly the type of book a musician would write i think i'd give it 4 5 stars but since i can't i'm just the teensiest bit unwilling to induct it into the 5 stars hall of fame it borders on ya ish in simplicity of theme and just overall tone but it's dark and resonant a less edgy and more poetic palahniuk","683":"vague also because his dad's tv was too loud really","684":"first i think i should point out that i didn't know this guy was a musician so it's safe to say i was not a fan of him in any sense before reading the book the reason i picked it up was because it sounded like a cool concept to me and something that i could relate with and yeah i could relate to this book a lot i think it focuses on its subject in smart ways the biggest downside to this book is how short it is though it does do a lot with what pages it has it does a good job in building up its main stories to their conclusions or their beginnings however you choose to look at it and that method of storytelling was good though not exactly original another thing i couldn't help focusing on was the narrative itself while it does seem right to be in sean's perspective i couldn't help wondering who he's speaking to or if he's just going through it in his mind one of the better parts of this book was how easy it is to identify with the characters and situations i have personally never played tabletop roleplaying games but i have been playing video games for pretty much my entire life they can be a great escape a stress reliever and it is very easy to be sucked into the story to the point of constructing your own story around it and people really can take roleplaying games this seriously despite this taking place some years in the past those aspects are very true to this day so while i would've loved to read more about lance and carrie and learn what brought them on their path overall the book was good it speaks a lot about isolation and the parent child divide the power of roleplaying games and so forth i wouldn't call it a classic but it's certainly worth reading","685":"what a strange and haunting read i read it in just a few hours time couldn't put it down it was pretty unsettling though but very interesting at the same time i don't know how recommendable it is maybe only if you're looking for something really quick that'll kind of mess with your head","686":" i'd expect no less from john darnielle given the excellence of his mountain goats music a beautifully rendered examination of a consciousness trying to understand itself and explain itself to others at the same time pitch perfect evocation of inland socal that quincunx of pomona claremont upland and ontario with montclair sitting in the middle of it all darnielle also evokes perfectly a pre web pre mobile youth culture that is starkly different from today's intricately connected teen world and yet no different from any youth culture of any decade with its morbid confusion alienation extreme fascinations and overarching loneliness","687":"who knew one of my favorite musicians would write one of my favorite novels of 2014 john darnielle of the mountain goats expands on many of the themes from his last decade's worth of albums particularly the juxtaposition of the sublime and grotesque in wolf in white van if you've ever related to his lyrics you really ought to have this expanded experience recommended","688":" warning major mountain goats nerdery contained herein one of the many excellent things that comes through in mountain goats lyrics is john darnielle's tenderness for the outsider the misunderstood the outcast he cares about the high school kids in the best ever death metal band out of denton the emotional refugees in color in your cheeks people who others talk down to he's called them it's the same tenderness that shows through in this book one that made me feel like i was somehow marvelously experiencing two different mountain goats songs being woven together on the one hand you've got sean definitely an outcast but arrived at a place of peace you can tell his younger self couldn't imagine his memories are sad and wistful at once kind of imbued with a significance and melancholia that's more implied than explained outright i kept thinking of the line i remember the train headed south out of bangkok down towards the water or any and all of downtown seoul like that guy tooling down the west texas highway in source decay he's a long way away from these significant memories emotionally and mentally as distant as texas is from bangkok but they still resonate deeply postcards from the past on the other side of things you have lance and carrie the kids who take his mail order rpg too seriously and too far here i couldn't stop thinking of the lush and lovely san bernardino the song jd was talking about with that line about people who are talked down to in both the book and the song they're kids on the road young and dumb and in love in the song they feel at home in the world even though the world isn't giving them its best yet i feel hope for them because they love each other i have a fondness for them though i barely know them their feeling for one another inspires me is what it is it might as well be sean speaking there at the end as their stories begin to intersect and for the first half of this book i was planning to give it 4 stars for sure it ended up at 3 because i found it difficult to track which sections were sean now vs near past sean which was particularly frustrating given that we were also juggling distant past sean both pre and post accident i felt like there was a lot more to lance and carrie's story a why or maybe a how that we don't get maybe that's partly the point but it was frustrating to have their story cut off when it felt so premature without saying too much and spoiling things the ending didn't quite work for me there's so much power in not overexplaining in carving out a motivation or emotion by not looking at it head on especially if it's too big too weighty the examples that spring to mind are all modernist or modernism inspired the love song of j alfred prufrock and other poems the hours kora and ka with mira mare so i very much appreciate what darnielle's doing here as we race backwards in time to the denouement which is far from a surprise by the time you get there i just felt like the connection wasn't quite made i'd missed one building block in the carefully constructed show don't tell of what happened and why i want to go read other reviews now to get different takes on it maybe i'd feel different after a reread so basically this was really good and nicely different and i hope it's far from his last book it was such a treat to discover all this new talent in someone whose work i already loved i can't wait to see what comes out next","689":"more of a 3 5 5 what i really like about wolf in white van is that john darnielle's writing is beautifully lyrical and the snail mail rpg was totally awesome i will totally play that if i had been a more patient person i wasn't expecting such an introspective narative but it kind of works in a reverse chronological way i wasn't terribly moved nor felt sympathy for the character especially after reading the last chapter i was kind of hoping for a bit more i guess","690":"i want to write a review of this book but i'm struggling it was very good but enjoyable is not really the right word it was over before i learned everything i wanted to it was painful and bittersweet to read it was strange and really dark but also weirdly uplifting basically it was a mountain goats song","691":"it is a very special experience to read the fiction of a lyricist you've admired for a long time a fascinating story that traverses the dark corners of a young weirdo's mind my only gripe is that the heavy gamer nerdiness of the main story line probably made parts of the story harder to latch onto for me despite this it was still a quick read and i've never read anything quite like it my favorite commentary on the book is on the back cover by writer austin grossman blisteringly authentic like a garage made bomb on a slow burning fuse or like john darnielle set out to adapt an old iron maiden t shirt as a literary novel and succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams","692":"zoomed through it in a day as it is hard to put down intriguing emotional content but also strange the first person's detached tone is unsettling the author fully intended for this effect and its result was feeling of disquiet through the whole reading like an axe murderer lives next door i have never read a book like this before i admit that it was in some ways hard to continue the entire plot is based upon a sad event but the writing is so visual and superb truly flawless writing of level that i haven't come across in a while that you can't step away this dichotomy of beautiful art and uncomfortable topic is like as a simile comparison an artistic horror flick you don't want to look because you know what awaits but it is so lovely in its creation and so fascinating in its outcome that you can't stop looking","693":"super hard to follow at times as this book has no plot i enjoyed the writing style but it was overshadowed by my dissatisfaction with the book's flow","694":"melancholy and hypnotic enjoyed the structure how it unravels backward i listened to the audio which the author reads he's not only a great writer but one of the best readers i've listened to","695":"i couldn't put this down it's exactly the kind of novel you would imagine jd would write if you have listened to his music i read it just after it came out the week my grandmother died when i needed a distraction of just this kind read it","696":"the book is written in a backwards format and deals with a pretty cool subject that much i'm sure the rest is mystery","697":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here incredibly engaging and imaginative lots of questions going through my head as i reflect on the book did sean have the seeds of the game in his head before what happened between the arcade and the walk home what drove his decision making how is conan involved was he searching for his own answers by watching tbn was he really aware of how involved his gamers were and did he string them along to see how far he could push them i really enjoyed this one and highly recommend it","698":" a nominee for the 2014 national book award wolf in white van tells the story of sean phillips a young man suffering severe facial disfiguration sean's story is told out of chronological order we are sent back to his childhood then thrust forward to the present unwinding the puzzle of how he arrived to become so horribly mutilated as a way to cope sean has created a play by mail role playing game called trace italian it becomes apparent though that sean has been escaping from reality for many years well before the traumatic accident video games heavy metal music fantasy novels all provided a route for sean to withdraw from his life that's it in my mind a national book award winner needs to be hefty--many pages full of important probably historical ruminations on human behavior or class warfare in england throw a world war in there... maybe some nazis end with the reader grabbing for that box of tissues and pow you win the trifecta but while wolf in white van is deceptively simple and at around 200 pages somewhat slight there is a lot going on here structurally the puzzle first time author john darnielle builds is fascinating and engaging you want to uncover the clues and relish the moments as the fog burns away and the picture become clearer the character of sean a heavy metal listening conan the barbarian reading sci fi movie watching outcast is sadly all too familiar in our day and age he might be seen wearing a black trench coat outside the cafeteria at columbine high school he might be that quiet kid who acts a little weird and just wishes the other kids would stop pushing him around and let him read his guns and ammo magazine in peace the story is heartbreaking in the way all senseless tragedies that could have been avoided always are i have not heard the author's rock band the mountain goats but i am aware they have a rabid following including the great stephen colbert and if their songs contain even a small percentage of the pathos and tragic characters oh his debut novel then this adoration is well earned this is not a fun read it's dark and gloomy and full of bad decisions however it is a fulfilling story that rewards a careful reading it is a deep novel well written that will stick around in the hallways of you mind well after you have closed the cover","699":" it's rare for a book focusing on character over plot to hook me as well as wolf in white van by john darnielle lead singer of the indie rock group the mountain goats the narrator sean has a face that is disfigured because of an injury and he makes an income through mail in role playing game that acts as a choose your own adventure story through a nuclear wasteland a couple of players die reinacting their moves in real life and it causes sean the narrator to reflect on his life the story moves backwards in time as we build toward the event that disfigured sean but what makes the book so compelling is how complicated sean becomes as the story unfolds themes of isolation depression meaning love and grief are woven together perfectly by darnielle as we learn more and more about sean's past","700":"the rhythm of the prose is a little strange taking jagged turns into metaphor in a way that i'm not used to reading once i got used to that i really enjoyed the book and the gradual revelation of the foundations of the story is utterly enthralling","701":"i could definitely see how this book wouldn't be a lot of people's cup of tea i'm still not sure how i feel about it i understood what was going on in the main character's head but it made me feel empty and isolated just by doing so i think we all have a vivid imagination that allows us to deal with reality but sean's case with conan and the game took it to the extreme","702":"somewhere between 3 and 4 still processing","703":"3 5 stars i'm a huge mountain goats fan and i love the way you can really hear john darnielle's voice in the writing the main character would not be out of place in one of his songs i enjoyed the way the story unravels and the way that i could see the end coming but was still surprised by the turns along the way the best way i can think to describe it is that it's a choose your own adventure story in reverse it's also short just over 200 pages so easy to pick up and finish in a couple of days if you're on the fence about it","704":"i liked this book and it kept me interested but i didn't love it there was something about the pacing that threw me off i kept wanting more information and follow through than i was getting i have a lot of appreciation for books that are unique and i think this one is but in the end it felt incomplete somehow","705":"i read this for what is likely a dumb reason that being that my husband who to my knowledge does not have library card asked me to reserve it for him at the library i had no idea who it was by or what it was about but once it was sitting in my hands i decided to give it a go it should be noted that while my husband is a band t shirt owning mountain goats fan i couldn't even name one song so i truly came into this cold it's an odd little book there is a point where i was reading a three page section on krull yes really that krull and i just looked up from the book to give my husband a bewildered look the whole thing is like that obscure bits of old school nerd culture wrapped unevenly around a story that isn't really telling you anything when i say that i mean that motives are obfuscated and denied throughout the pieces don't fit together cleanly and moreover is there even a puzzle the only theme i drew from this is that there is a world of possibilities but once a choice is made those other possibilities cease to exist forever time can not be run backward although the book does it's sort a reverse multiple universe where each choice rather than infinitely branching permanently collapses the other timelines if all that sounds crazy than i've pretty well replicated the experience of reading this weird book for someone that reads dozens of books a year it was incredibly unique but i don't know if i would describe it as good","706":"i really liked the middle of this book the first 40 pages are awful and the ending leaves far too many unanswered questions but the middle is fascinating","707":"meandered and lacked focus although its prose was a joy at times poetical and vivid at times inventive metaphors throughout however i lost interest this novel was recommended due to enjoying ready player one i would not make the same recommendation","708":" darnielle clearly likes words and he uses them well i appreciate how he told sean's story which was non linear but not so disjointed that it didn't make sense or come together in the end it showed discipline and an understanding of how to make a compelling story by moving its plot pieces around however nothing really wowed me about this book like i said he's good with words and things never came off pretentious but sometimes there were sentences that could've been a little less showy and there were times when sean's morose and disturbed complacency seemed a little heavy handed almost forced almost enjoyed it but just three stars it was good","709":"step into the mind of arseface from preacher if he were a regular suburban kid spoiler alert nothing fantastical is revealed you know what you need to know early on and just settle into this sad man's thoughts and history like most of his songs you get dropped in the story care and it ends with a lingering the good kind","710":" john darnielle can't shut up and that's a good thing here's the thing about this book you don't have to like jd's music or even know it exists to enjoy this book or to recognize the skill in its construction pacing and full on weirdness and i'm not quite sure how much that matters wiwv has a lot going for it on the surface finely tuned and fussed over prose a character whose regular plunges down the memory hole and laps through his own thoughts are perfectly contextualized he's a scarred recluse and an effectively rendered portrait of childhood unhappiness and instability that may not mirror jd's but certainly carries the same gear it's hard not to read this as a young jd lying alone in his room sweating and uneasy finding fixed points in sword u0026amp sorcery and in skull adventures to go to into detail about this book's plot would not be hard because in truth only a few things actually happen to sean the narrator this book concerns itself more with the why not the how and the jumble of memories and flashbacks and significances takes on a horrifying dream logic as we further understand why sean's disfigured and why he dealt with the aftermath as he did as a self contained ornately crafted box of a book wiwv unquestionably succeeds and as an extension of jd's refusal to sacrifice nuance for effect it handles itself as admirably as any of his many many hyperliterate song lyrics i would warn anyone looking for a satisfying narrative to not approach this book as such it's a literary automat of constant low band loneliness eerie resignation truncated sadness and ennui that ends on a textual knife twist do not expect to walk out of this book with a full and balanced heart","711":" a staggeringly good novel about escape fantasy disfigurement and conan the barbarian in sean philips john darnielle has created one of the most fascinating characters i've read about in a long time an enigma who finds meaning through interaction with players of his self created role playing game trace italian sean is heavily disfigured but he is not a maudlin cipher serving as inspirational hope nor is he a misunderstood frankenstein monster he's simply an incredibly interesting human being and the glimpses we get of his personal life of his game and of his own perception of his disfigurement make the book an extremely engaging read aside from that darnielle weaves this arresting character into a captivating narrative which comes to us from sean himself in fragmented bits and pieces that we must puzzle together and out of this story comes an incredibly sad exploration of fantasy vs reality of escape as a way to cope and imagination as a shelter as well as a prison fantastic book","712":"surprisingly unsurprisingly john darnielle can write good novels as well as good lyrics","713":"i simply couldn't get into it a book replete with interesting ideas somehow found me without care for its narrator and it's prose further compounded the problem by being ruthlessly complex and rather boring in its complexity you can see the william gibson influences but without the world to match","714":" a fever dream a stare into the fire kind of vision quest it's that kind of book and yet the story felt thin perhaps because of its slim size read more like a novella usually i would be excited about a book like this it has a unique structure an ending revealed upfront and the story going back in time a re telling through a text based game world evocatively called trace italian the melancholy burns it has scorched out all the oxygen in the air will wait a bit before writing a full review","715":"imagine a choose your own adventure written for holden caufield by albert camus","716":"engrossing gorgeously and lyrically rendered i could have finished this in a day but for life repeatedly getting in the way","717":"john darnielle does an excellent job of taking you inside the mind of his main character and quite the mind it is this book hooked me because it puts you right there with the memories and emotions of the main character especially because the story is told in a strange reverse type way i would read this book a 2nd time in fact i almost immediately did i knew darnielle was a great musician but i had no idea he was also a great novelist","718":"i've been a casual fan of the mountain goats for some time although by no means an obsessive that john darnielle had written a novel was really no surprise given his wordy lyrics and to be honest when i found out this was his debut i was almost surprised really it took him that long to transition from lyrically dense story songs to the written word anyway i finished this book last night and am still thinking about it unlike so many novels written by musicians this is not one of those thinly disguised fictional accounts of being in a band mercifully but rather a strange labyrinthine tale of a horribly disfigured young man named sean who a decade earlier for reasons never really explained fired a rifle into his face since then he's lived a quiet life supplementing his insurance payouts from a mail based game called trace italian where he emails photocopied sheets featuring scenarios from a nightmarish post apocalyptic world that players respond to their responses dictating the next move think of an almost infinitely complicated pick a path book there's something unknowable about sean and the general sense of the book is like a slowly unfolding puzzle whose end is ultimately obscured i am still not sure i understand everything that happened to sean and i guess wolf in white van is a book i should probably read again a beautifully written and fascinating book highly recommended","719":" i've had a note on my to do list to write about this book since i finished it in january it stuck in my craw because i really wanted it to be a five star book yet it didn't quite get there for me so i've been thinking about why there is a lot about this book that is thoughtful and lovely including the writing itself and the unusual narrative structure i had to spend some time analyzing the structure before i realized how well the nonlinear backwards circular storytelling worked it would be a completely different book if it was told in a linear fashion and a significantly less affecting one at least i would have had more trouble relating to the narrator if his teenage self was our point of entry to this story instead we're introduced to a guy who has done some maturing and is doing kind of okay all things considered who we then follow down the rabbit hole into the past the structure feels necessary instead of gimmicky and huge props to darnielle for being able to pull that off and when i got to the grim end of the circle on the last page i wanted to read it again--almost to reassure myself that things did get better because when i first started reading i couldn't yet understand how far sean had come i have to mention that i could not stop thinking of chuck palahniuk's invisible monsters while i was reading wolf since both have a nonlinear disjointed narrative coupled with narrators who view spoiler caused their own disfigurement hide spoiler in invisible monsters the reveal of the narrator's own role in what happened to her face was this big dramatic moment while wolf's parallel reveal was a slow burn and while it's explicitly clear why the girl in monsters did what she did sean's motive doesn't make any logical sense and i think that was the point but that didn't make it satisfying the final scenes of the day leading up the accident kind of reminded me of the scenes in gillian flynn's dark places with the teenagers in the 80s who to go out and satanically sacrifice a cow like ok i guess i can buy this because being a teenager is weird and difficult and sometimes they do batshit things but i can't come close to actually understanding to return to the invisible monsters comparison it feels really weird to come away from this book saying i understand sean less than i understand daisy st patience or whatever you want to call her because invisible monsters is an over the top fairly ridiculous story and wolf feels much more grounded in reality perhaps it's also more realistic in wolf that the characters can't be neatly explained or understood --but is that a problem in a work of fiction it isn't just sean i had a similar problem with lance and carrie and i'm less sure the reasons i found their story confusing were intentional were they delusional or just playing their own spin on the game were they serious or just messing around and brutally unlucky and how much did sean know it's possible i missed something in the text but i spent a good chunk of this book waiting for answers i never received which is another reason i should go back and read it again but for now four stars and maybe i'll reread invisible monsters in the meantime to see if my recollections hold up","720":"a difficult yet thought provoking novel like a prism the story is told through reflected and refracted moments of sean's the narrator present and past definitely a book in need of discussion as it is complex in its simplicity the question remains why did he do it if this were more easily answered i would give it 3 stars","721":"i really enjoyed this but i have absolutely no idea what it was about","722":"well that was disturbing","723":"one of the best books i have read in a long time","724":" i've been a fan of the mountain goats for over two decades so i was quite interested to see what john darnielle would choose to write about in this brief novel he explores what it's like to live with disfigurement the narrator of his story is sean who's lived for decades with facial deformities that isolate him from others he's used this isolation to produce a play by mail game trace italian that has accumulated a small band of devoted players including a few who have taken the game too seriously the writing as one might expect from darnielle is solid dream like and often lyrical the story such as it is is more of a character portrait than anything plot based sean describes his life from present to past though why he does so is a bit of mystery unlike say time's arrow which uses a backward path to lead the reader into the awful secret past of the main character or memento which uses backward moving snippets to let the viewer experience what it's like to have amnesia the backward motion of wolf in white van doesn't to my eye reveal any hidden backwards messages this method combined with sean's inclination to mix his reality with his internal fantasies does however create a misty and haunting atmosphere but sean has a curious scarcity of emotion for one who's experienced and is experiencing trauma and darnielle chooses not to provide us with more than a few vague and conflicting hints as to why sean makes the monumental choices he does the overall feeling of the book is one of mature resignation an emotion i don't see often explored in books but one which confines the potential emotional intensity of sean's story extra points for bringing play by mail games to mind a subject i hadn't thought of since my pre teen years when i pored with wonder and curiosity over the back end ad sections of 1980s fantasy and gaming magazines","725":" i did not know what to expect from this book basically read it because my son had given it glowing reviews once i started it i could not put it down being an older woman i was never really into the video games that my children were so fascinated with so i suppose i just wanted to try to grasp some understanding of the genre the author john darnielle fleshes out his characters very well which really does help the reader get into their heads probably due to my age i felt more compassion for the parents of the the main character","726":"an extremely exciting novel where not a lot happens and too much happens","727":"actual rating 1 5sean phillips has lived an isolated life due to his disfigurement from a teenage injury to make a living he runs a game through the mail when his game has real life consequences sean is called on to account for it this leads him to a retrospective state where we go back through his life to the point of his injury i really didn't like this book the injury felt like it was suppose to be this big reveal but i feel like darnielle told us what happened a zillion times and didn't meaningfully dive into the why listening to this book kinda reminded me of listening to a hipster being really introspective at the end of his life is that too mean i didn't hate the writing style i just had an issue with the lack of content in this book","728":"now we see things as in a mirror dimly infuriatingly good","729":"i was really excited that this was by the mountain goats guy especially since his lyrics are so gorgeous i think i might appreciate it more once i read some interpretations of it by other readers i liked it but feel like there were aspects i didn't understand","730":"without the second to last paragraph i don't know if it would have earned the fourth star i wish the book had stopped there for all the things i liked about the novel i could see too much evidence of the work done on the deliberate structure to really feel immersed","731":"i was pulled into this book immediately the main character an interesting and not so lovable outcast runs a fantasy play through the mail game and the reader is left to wonder wether or not he intentionally shot himself in the face years earlier this was one of those books that seems to know what is going on in your life when you read it at least it was for me if you liked wolf in white van i think you would love the sorrows of young mike","732":"as a teenager sean was hospitalized and left profoundly disfigured to cope he absorbed himself in the creation of a post apocalyptic text based game trace italian wolf in white van is a novel about internal and external narratives the stories we take in the stories we put out as tools for self creation and self expression especially but not uniquely as it relates to trauma it has a vaguely inverted narrative working backwards from sean's adult life to his teenage injury that's a lot going on for a fairly short book and it works as often as not the timeline can be difficult to keep straight and the contrived narrative as often feels coy as compelling in particular i'm not happy that mental health issues are a reveal sean's voice is distant and cerebral denying reader investment but trace italian is fascinating and functions well as a larger metaphor thematically the book coalesces this is an absorbing effort one which is ultimately successful but which i can't say i particularly enjoyed or recommend","733":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i read somewhere that ever since bob dylan and leonard cohen what folk lyricists have been trying to do is push themselves to the limits of what they are able to express while some of the more oblique images and lines might not form as well in our heads they hold power because it's easy to tell how personal they are and there's a radiant confidence inherent to someone dedicated to the task of cutting out the middleman of literal language to hint at something much more important than they cou i read somewhere that ever since bob dylan and leonard cohen what folk lyricists have been trying to do is push themselves to the limits of what they are able to express while some of the more oblique images and lines might not form as well in our heads they hold power because it's easy to tell how personal they are and there's a radiant confidence inherent to someone dedicated to the task of cutting out the middleman of literal language to hint at something much more important than they could possibly express using it hence it's no wonder that darnielle's debut novel is so full of these blank spaces these somber abstractions these powerful dead ends and it is a lyrical novel the style of storytelling that presents a unique story packed with sentiment and honesty it has fixations more than it has theses topics more than assertions if there is a central key to the whole thing it's presented in much the way it is in breakfast of champions a single phrase in passing is the apparent takeaway in this case it's a misguided attempt at finding the conspiracy that corrupts youth the central question that this ties into is why the protagonist shot himself everyone around him seems to be searching for that answer but ultimately it can't surface until he figures it out himself and perhaps this novel telling things in close to reverse order is that persona retracing its steps to help itself find out why it has this penchant for self destruction as a coping mechanism coping from what a lot of time is spent on sean's unhealthy quirks and violent thoughts and how through their exercise he feels sheltered in some way he doesn't quite understand in adult life this manifests itself as a game where the goal is to seek the ultimate shelter but sean has some awareness of its impossibility putting hundreds of obstacles in the walls of the trace italian having a true ending that he never expects to mail to anyone perhaps his suicide attempt wizened him in that way and maybe those are the big thoughts he begins having in the hospital making this struggle into a career and maybe helping out some younger kids with their issues now that he's found the consequences sean's game is antiquated unbearably quaint i believe darnielle's phrase is so maybe it's uncool to actively seek this relief it's unclear to me whether only the uncool feel this need or whether it's everyone's burden that only the uncool are willing to openly express the suicide pact a clear parallel to sean's suicide attempt was made in search of the same relief from the nameless angst that the book spends its time searching for but in it we get another odd clue the digging the actual details of it were never clear to me they tried to bury themselves to keep warm there's an odd amount of digging going on in the trace italian game if you notice it and it seems to only come together when the digger seeker clan is mentioned to dig in the earth for relief to ask nature for answers for figurative warmth in the case of the unfortunate couple is a fairly powerful image and it's surely no mistake that the trace itself is largely underground as dictated by the game there is no end to this search the fact that the end even exists is a formality and it will never be deployed it's something that sean playing god reserves for himself the takeaway then is the title the wolf in the white van the desperate search for what is corrupting rather than the real search at hand not for relief but for what causes us to look for relief and be in need of so much guidance maybe this is why the book is somewhat backwards chronologically it's not about searching for the trace italian the conventional journey it's about searching for the epicenter of the nuclear disaster the music he listens to is in his own words terrible but it's better than the noise in his head it's not what he was seeking in the bullet it's what he was running from the person who jumps from a burning building is just as scared of falling as you and i but fire is even scarier indeed the last few paragraphs of the novel are spent in a mad dash of trying to explain his impending actions a nuclear meltdown of an ending a destination reached that was really all along the heart of the fear that compelled the journey a few lingering questions the symbol of a star reoccurs at a few points on top of the trace italienne being shaped like a star he seems to associate stars with safety at a few points i couldn't remember off of the top of my head for sure in his hospital fever dream the desert has a trillion stars overhead safety in the cosmic in high concepts chris is an odd character if my analysis is on point he became so absorbed by the quest that he had to kill himself in game to bring some closure to it and resume his real life maybe this is what sean means when he calls the game a safe space that it's preferable he realize the end of his futile quest in the game rather than in the real world like the couple did i'd have to reread it and pick up more on chris' characteristics as a player which would discuss his search for relief as a person anyways greatly enjoyed the book would not at all mind darnielle writing some more of the delicious stuff more","734":"finished this book yesterday and its moments jd's phrases and sean's way of thinking have really wormed their way into my head i'm rating this 5 stars because i think it's going to stay that way for a long time trace italian conan his condition yeah i really liked this beautiful","735":"there were moments of genius in this book but the conclusion was such a disappointment i know there are readers who loved this book and i was one of them until the last few pages i felt cheated out of an ending that the beginning and middle of this story deserved","736":"a frustrating read at times sean is a difficult narrator its shortness makes that endurable though and the story is worthwhile","737":"huh i am really not sure what to make of that coming back a few days later this book has been on my mind a lot and the more i think about it and talk about it the more i like it i am still not entirely satisfied with the ending also maybe this just reflects what else i've read recently ish but i am getting a little burned out on troubled teen stories","738":"i finished wolf in white van in january of 2015 and did not read a book as unique or effecting that year it stirred something in me when i first finished it i didn't know what to say i considering it like a rubix cube turning it over and over but no knowing how to solve it it's broad in scope and subject yet deeply personal i found it very raw and open yet all the while holding the reader at a distance darnielle's pros may be be seen as simplistic by some but they are filled with unique and powerful imagery and emotions these capture the wild imagination of the protagonist sean for sean his imagination is a source of comfort but also suffering it isolates him for others yet gives him solace in that isolation other than the power of the imagination and isolation the novel also deals with causation why do people do the things we do why do some people just break ultimately it proposes that there is no reason when exams up close darnielle's use of time and consciousness narratively is of a high craft that you see from few established authors those who may be sceptical about musicians turning their hands to high art this novel is an example of one of the best endeavours to do so i believe i will have to read it through a few more times to really appreciate and understand the many levels of it but saying that i would highly recommend it here ends another one of my crappy reviews","739":"a story only darnielle could tell it's a stunning exploration about the lines that reality and fantasy run across our lives internally and across our faces like the game in the book #traceitalian it's a dark world beautifully composed and a little too easy get lost in","740":"i enjoyed reading this book but i am glad it was short the book's strongest asset is its beautiful prose there is no typical character arc i guess the character's conflict is within himself but he really does not perceive that he has a conflict and is always quite accepting of his station in life so really there is no typical tension escalation or conflict resolution one might say that his conflict is with the world but i would disagree because the protagonist does not seem to care about that and is very accepting so he has no motivation whatsoever to change what darnielle does give us is a well written glimpse into the mind of a troubled adolescent teenager who is a fantastic thinker what is interesting to me though is that he clearly was inclined to his imaginative musings even before his disfigurement so this event is not really a nexus to this trait or his introverted life it is more of an event that just happens along the way darnielle goes on to describe the protagonists inner thoughts as he lives with a permanent and horrific disfigurement the excellent writing gives an idea of what it might be like but since the main character really did not seem to care about his lesser lot in life neither did i really as a reader the emotional impact was not there and there was never any connection whatsoever with the main character i felt as a reader that i was really hearing of his life from far outside not really drawn in the intermingled thread in the story about the role playing game he runs was perhaps meant to mirror the main characters life events but i wish there had been a stronger connection the thread about the two game players who take his game too seriously fell flat and was over before it started without an ounce of conflict or tension this book actually seemed to even lack a plot it is more of a long diary entry there was a hint at some conflict with his parents but it was only superficially explored so overall i felt this book lacked a lot of key story elements but was beautifully written i did not spend one minute pondering the main character's story after i finished the book there was no emotional investment for me as a reader it is such a short book and quick read that i think it is worth reading to form your own opinion perhaps there is more connection to the protagonist's life for others i just did not feel it on any real level myself it is interesting to see a book that seems to break a lot of conventional rules in the writing and publishing world succeed that makes this book worth the read too","741":"surprisingly gentle given the darkness of the subject feels a little more like reading a very long story song lyric than a novel but that's not a bad nor a surprising thing","742":"i had been looking forward to reading this book since i saw the cover of it on npr's book concierge last year it was different than i expected if i had to pinpoint a specific problem it would be the lack of a plot and also the uncertain timeline i will say i gained a much better appreciation for the book after listening to it discussed on nate cordory's podcast reading aloud http readingaloud wolfpop com audio still a fan of the mountain goats and i appreciate what john darnielle was going for it just did not work for my personal taste","743":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wiw is probably not the next great american novel or whatever some mountain goats fans have willed it to be even at just over 200 pages it at times felt like certain chapters were redundant maybe it would have worked better as a novella either way i thought it was on the whole a nuanced and well written story the nonlinear format didn't feel contrived but rather seemed to mirror sean's fractured world view in the end i think this book is essentially a character study a twisting path wiw is probably not the next great american novel or whatever some mountain goats fans have willed it to be even at just over 200 pages it at times felt like certain chapters were redundant maybe it would have worked better as a novella either way i thought it was on the whole a nuanced and well written story the nonlinear format didn't feel contrived but rather seemed to mirror sean's fractured world view in the end i think this book is essentially a character study a twisting path that looks into the interstices of sean's mind and the ways in which fantasy interfaces with the real world not much of material interest happens to further a plot just like in real life there are no easy answers or neat narrative arcs that seems in large part to be the point of the novel actually before sean's accident his fantasies are dark ones of conquest and ultimate doom everything tends toward a definite climactic end but when he tries to end his life and fails he realizes that there are no climaxes that things continue on indefinitely without closure or meaning before fading away his dreams of barbarian conquest are replaced by the labyrinthine construct of the trace italian a place of final safety which is designed to be fundamentally unattainable it also seems to have double symbolism as the impenetrable constricting fortress of sean's disfigurement which keeps him cut off from the rest of the world the trace italian isn't just a monument to isolation though along the way the fragmented stories of other seekers of the trace received through the mail offer a counterpoint to sean's own ordeal these stories provide a half glimpsed look into other lonely minds other seans who we don't have the benefit of seeing so clearly the case of carrie and lance is especially important serving as an inverted mirror of sean and kimmy's own story taken together the picture all of these isolated vignettes paint is a dark one about trying to hold on to meaning in a confusing and arbitrary world thankfully john darnielle dives into this world with a deep sense of empathy and tact and the results are potent more","744":"the ultimate motivation behind the protagonist's pivotal act remains a mystery though it may be as simple as the almost universal teenage feeling of alienation from the world and that is the feeling this book captures so well the almost inexplicable nature of it rings true i feel like there is a lot more here than i picked up on in my first reading indeed the title refers to the supposed back masking of hidden satanic lyrics in 1970s rock you have to work a bit to find the message and is there really a message there or do you hear what you want this was a compelling novel and will bear a second go","745":"this is a trippy book taking you backwards and forwards in time dancing around two main events and what exactly they are and why they happened its worth rereading and then contemplating and then prob talking to other readers to finish processes it","746":" 3 5 stars really but i round up i got a free copy of this one after macmillan's literary fiction panel at bookcon although i'd heard of the mountain goats before mostly from a t shirt worn by john green if i'm being terribly honest i'd never heard any of their songs after a brief youtube excursion i'd gotten a sampling and was ready to dive into the book wolf in white van is smart and scary i love the idea of a handwritten snail mail rpg in today's technology drive society it's clever enough to be worthy of such a complicated narrator the transitions between past and present -- as well as game and reality -- are managed clearly somehow even though it's clear to the reader which is which these transitions still somehow manage tho show the ways in which a role playing game can start to blur the line between fantasy and reality the narrator's brilliance and disturbance are fascinating and terrifying at the same time he's not entirely honest -- either with the reader or with himself i suspect -- but he's interesting worth a read if you don't mind some heavy disturbing subject matter","747":"some excellent passages and a compelling story yet ultimately unsatisfying","748":"moody while being slight like his music an intense meditation on loneliness plain and powerful language the novel surprised at the structure a great read kept me pondering days later","749":"the best work of fiction i've read in at least a decade it's like a feature length mountain goats song","750":"this is one of those times where i am equally disappointed in myself as a reader as i am with the book i have read the intriguing synopsis and simplistic eye catching cover had my attention but wolf in white van eluded my desire to like it more than i have it is a shame seeing how wolf in white van has some excellent reviews and was a novel that i thought was right up my alley there were parts where i was drawn to and immersed in but the trance broke easily since the language would fall into a dry repetitive lull it brings to mind paul yoon's snow hunters both have a solemn heaviness to the atmosphere of the novels and have tragic characters yet found no resonating sympathy in me much faith was put into the concept and the message they were trying to impart in the most subtle of ways but my expectations of it never aligned to my reading experience perhaps i was still hung up on emily st john mandel's station eleven to open my heart to another perhaps i'll be the black sheep in not warming up to this book as others have taken to so easily perhaps wolf in white van just wasn't isn't the book for me","751":"i've thought about this book somewhat continually since finishing it can't wait to reread it","752":"i was talking to someone about the structure of this book while i was in the middle of reading it and i said that i was glad even though it ended in a dark place that it had started essentially at the end with a moment of transcendent joy i think parts of it might have been almost impossible for me to get through without that little bit of knowledge the author is of course john darnielle of the mountain goats and that idea that joy comes always and often only after pain is an important one at least to me like many of the best mountain goats songs the novel played with themes of love and loss of found familes and wrong turns and struggling through sometimes without even really knowing why you are struggling but i also thought it held together well as a novel on its own i loved all the parts about trace italian and felt the pull of that vivid fantasy world even on the page and i liked that even though it's a short novel it felt longer in a good way like something to be savored and meditated upon it was a tough read in spots but it drew me back for a second read for sure the central mystery of what happened to sean is not much of a mystery at all and pretty quickly uncovered but i won't spoil it here i will say that it might trigger some people with trauma and loss in their backgrounds so if anyone needs more details drop me a line it's definitely a book that will linger with me and i hope this is the first of a long and fruitful new career for darnielle","753":"i only wish that i had had the time to read this in one sitting the way john darnielle releases details of the plot little by little was delicious and i would have loved to string them all together in one fell swoop such beautiful writing in such an unsettling environment i loved it","754":" wolf in white van was a friend's pick for his favorite of the year so i knew i had to give it a go i'm not sure that i found it life changing but john darnielle exhibits some truly masterful control over his storytelling it's remarkable to watch him move you through time going forward and back through segues in his protagonists mind and all the while building to the story that you've been wanting to know since page one only to realize that you both know it already and it is more horrifying than you imagined","755":"i loved this book so much it's like it was written for me the pacing the rhythm the characters the game within the book all of it easily in the top ten i will read it again something i rarely do","756":"this book is beautifully written and interested but i had so much trouble getting through all but the middle 50ish pages","757":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here ugh bleh blech i waded through barely comprehensible jib jab about a role playing mailer game for what exactly spoilers followa senseless random act that forever changed the lives of more than one family it could have been scores worse apparently the fact it wasn't is ascribed to a decision made with little to no thought or feeling to the outcomes

jib jab about a role playing mailer game for what exactly spoilers followa senseless random act that forever changed the lives of more than one family it could have been scores worse apparently the fact it wasn't is ascribed to a decision made with little to no thought or feeling to the outcomes or impact of any possible choice he could have killed everyone in the house he could have waited and used mail order swords to slaughter the neighbours nah i'll just shoot myself in the head with my rifle actually the 'nah' lends too much feeling to the choice instead his actions are made with the strangest nothingness it's made me angry it feels like a pastiche of excuses hormones satanic music socially sidelined obsessive following of a violent comic series parents that just don't get it and yet none of these things seem to register they simply are this man boy is the least engaged protagonist i've ever encountered i may revise my star rating to reflect just how affected i am by this clearly well written but aaarrrrggghhhi'm frustrated u0026amp angry about this it's all too columbine u0026amp sandy hook u0026amp aurora just pointless loss u0026amp violence by these young men who create alt world views of themselves as powerful u0026amp 'other' so this guy only shot himself but that choice closed down life paths for his parents u0026amp himself u0026amp later 2 other youth and as indicated by his interactions in the present he's as disengaged u0026amp self absorbed as he was when he pulled the trigger gahhhh more","758":"the writing is very beautiful the story is interesting but feels like it relies too much on understanding rpgs for the casual reader i wonder how different it would be if there were fewer details about trace italian and more details about the people","759":"i knew i wanted to read this in as few sittings as possible but the time never seemed to materialize don't make the same mistake make the time for this one","760":"engaging and well written but ultimately went nowhere reminded me a lot of the wasp factory","761":"this book is written very well the language and construction are fantastic the story is revealed at just the right pace i found myself flipping back to reference events while the story is definitely unsettling i find myself continuing to think about its outcome beginnings and its intermediate events the way people change view each other interpret experiences are all opened for exploration","762":"absolutely loved this book","763":"been on a real reading jag lately i know the academic literati crowd loves stuff like this but just because someone writes well and can develop interesting characters doesn't mean there's a novel there i know lots of people that i think are very interesting but i don't want to read a whole book about them how about a story","764":"that wasn't as interesting as i wanted it to be the writing was beautiful but the story didn't fully explore any of the most compelling story aspects like the trace italian game or the story of the two kids who took it too seriously i also expected the ending to be much more satisfying but it didn't really deviate much from all the hints scattered throughout the rest of the book","765":"john darnielle is one of my favorite musicians and songwriters his songs helped me get through college and i can always listen to his work if i want something catchy emotional and more than most other music powerful when i heard he would be writing a book i was ecstatic my favorite works by him tell stories see tallahassee and most of his songs are about an individual or group and the trials and tribulations they face i felt like a novel would be a perfect continuation of this skill and a way for darnielle to tell a story that is more detailed and hopefully even more affecting as a result furthermore i had read his previous work master of reality and while i don't remember too much from it i remember feeling like it was an effective piece of fiction and being able to identify with it wolf in white van is interesting because for all of its pretense of plot structure it basically has none this book doesn't tell a single story that has a beginning middle and end rather it tells a multitude of stories from one man's life in a somewhat disconnected way with threads dropped picked up alluded to and sometimes left without finishing it's kind of like a concept album though in the dark side of the moon sense not the tommy sense or for more relevant examples in the we shall all be healed sense than the tallahassee sense the main character sean phillips suffered a horrible incident in his past and as a result has a very scarred face he lives his life maintaining a play by mail role playing game called trace italian through the course of the book we learn about his past his family his life the game and his imagination and by the end the connection i felt with the character was deep but also different whenever i finish a book i try to write a lot about it this is partly because i often enjoy the book and want others to experience it as well however it is also partly purely selfish and an opportunity to write about myself and my own life in a context that is not totally allegorical but also not completely truthful a review is the rare kind of writing that lets me talk freely about myself but in a way that is also somewhat constructive to be fair i would not call any of my reviews great reviews they lack not only an artistic sense which allows the writer to express themselves elegantly and attractively but also the insight to place the work in its proper social or historical contexts and make some points that can transcend the singular figure of the reviewer i would like to get better about both of those points but for now i enjoy the freedom that a review gives me to write about myself and try to elucidate personal feelings which i generally do not do i'm never completely satisfied with my reviews and how i articulate myself in them however as it often seems like i'm missing some aspect of my thoughts some crucial point that i know deep down but can't articulate sometimes because i prevent myself from doing so other times because i don't consciously know what that point is wolf in white van doesn't give the reader all the clues you don't end up with a clear sense of what sean's state of mind is nor with any sense of what he was thinking in the past all you get are the facts and if you're lucky a poetic line or two once in a while that seems to hint at some fundamental truth about sean darnielle has said in the past that he doesn't like giving away the deeper meaning of all of his lyrics and this tendency carries on to this book of course being obscure about characters' emotions is not a new trick everyone does it to varying degrees however given that the book is solely concerned with sean's state of mind in the past present and future it is noteworthy that the obscurity is so present and never goes away what this lack of information did to me is that it made the book's main takeaway a state of mind rather than any concrete lesson or even feeling i felt confused and unsure about everything like i wanted to think more deeply about my own state of mind while knowing that expressing any part of those thoughts would be impossible i will say though that every time i flipped back to a previous page which happened somewhat frequently given the structure of the book i gained new insights facts that seemed inconsequential at the time seemed to leap out and gain new significance this seems to suggest that maybe the book isn't obscure and that all of the meaning that one could want from the book is lying there in plain sight just not in the way one might expect as a result i will probably read this book again and i would not be surprised if i enjoyed it more this is a really fascinating book because it tries to examine a single person's mindset but does so in a very uncertain way it isn't always gripping or thrilling and as i said above left me with more of a state of mind than a feeling which makes me unable to give it really high marks but is certainly worth reading if only for the unique perspective and subject matter not to mention sean phillips himself","766":"different type of book not my style and taste will not read this author again","767":"short but enjoyable novel about a man with a horrible injury and his life running a dungeons and dragons style game where people submit their turns by mail that part was actually really interesting i didn't realize that was really a thing so ended up being kind of neat to hear about the interactions with people the thing is not really full of plot but i enjoyed the roughly 3 hours it took to read","768":" summer 2016 bingo by an author of a different gender this was in my audible library thanks to a 2015 episode of literary disco where the hosts raved about it i can see why there are so many layers to this story the tragic accident that leaves the main character sean the narrator disfigured the role playing game he wrote and now runs and another tragedy that results from that darnielle is great reading this he gives sean just the right voice and makes the parts about the game sheer poetry","769":" so if you love the mountain goats and you love john darnielle then the book is going to be both exactly what you'd expect and also deeply mind altering i mean like i've been occasionally catching myself staring into the middle distance just sitting there thinking about it for a long time zoning out about moments and lines and images and thinking that john darnielle is one of the most interesting and empathetic human beings i've ever known from afar this is the kind of book that for me it's really hard to talk about the there that's there it's not it doesn't reflect well for me to try and tell you anything about it i could tell you it's a multilayered maze a labyrinth that it's about memory and guilt and creation but it doesn't mean anything you should just read it i guess is what i'm saying","770":"this is a beautiful book but i do think i liked it more having listened to it on audiobook john darnielle is great at reading it and the language sounds and feels very beautiful when you hear it out loud i'd say a 4 star book and a 5 star audiobook","771":" when i was a teenager there was a small group of intelligent boys who listened to queen and played dungeons and dragons as a strange looking lonely girl i desperately wanted to be part of that group even though i hated queen there was something alluring about this world they could go to to the \"other\" characters they inhabited and the things that transpired there i even read some fantasy novels to gain cred with them they never let me play - until many years later when as adults they were still playing dungeons and dragons i was now a young mother of two kids but i was finally invited over to join in and you know what all i could think was really this slow moving detailed intricate game with funny looking cards this was what all the fuss was about i was bored in two seconds flat of course the game was about so much more than the cards the pictures the writing it's about what it becomes in your head it's about \"the trappings of the greater story\" as sean tells us in john darnielle's stunning \"wolf in white van\" it's about the power of the escape and of the choices we make sean has made a life altering choice as a teenager that has left him with hideous facial injuries leading him to be intensely isolated \"i felt like i couldn't find my way back to the world now like i was somebody locked in a meaningless side quest in a stuck screen \" while in hospital after the \"accident\" he sees his choice as \"either inventing internal worlds or having no world to inhabit\" and so he creates a choose your own adventure game trace italian which contains infinite choices \"technically it's possible to get to the last room in the final chamber of the trace italian but no one will ever do it no one will ever live that long \" game players subscribe and moves are sent by post and sean replies with the next situation in the sae provided but years later when the trace italian game inadvertently kills a teenage girl and injures her boyfriend he is drawn into a legal case and forced to examine his role in the tragedy something which threatens his ability to hold the grief about his life at bay the narrative is maze like - the game the past the present the almost future around each corner there is a doomed element to the story that hangs over every page while being about invented choices in fantasy sean tells us \"who doesn't want to rise above the obstacles in his pathway who wouldn't want to go down in flames and for those of us who can't or won't rise above who doesn't at least want to hear stories about how it might be possible for some triumph to eventually happen given enough luck \" but he also tells us \"this is why people cry at the movies because everybody's doomed no one in a movie can help themselves in any way their fate has already staked its claim on them from the moment they appear onscreen \"darnielle can capture a feeling with words in a way that takes your breath away he has a way of teasing out the plot while dazzling you with ideas and absorbing the reader right inside moments it's suffocating in the heart but expanding in the brain an addictive poetic effect \"wolf in white van\" is about both the limitations and scope inherent in creating something and in living a life it's partly a frankenstein story of creating a monster creativity that takes on a life of its own but it also delves into the use of fantasy to cope with overwhelming grief it's also about a disconnection and isolation that desperately collides with the instinct to find meaning \"everything became infused with purpose it's hard to overstate how deep the need can get for things to make sense \"\"there are only two stories either you go forward or you die \" but of course darnielle subverts what sean tells us by telling us a third story he is telling us a backwards story ending with the inciting incident \"the accident\" that has left him permanently disfigured this structure reflecting the theme of dark messages in songs only understood when played backwards \"the wolf in white van\" of the title and there is something inherently doomed about that isn't there that we only can understand our lives and find the message in hindsight that we can only see the choices once our move is over as teenagers we have the ability to make choices that can change the course of the rest of our lives without the wisdom or perspective to inform us if you are wondering why i was strange looking lonely girl it was the direct result of one of those choices my best friend at 15 years and nine months decided not to go forward but to die and this has affected the rest of my life \"wolf in white van\" shies away from any sentimentality but kicks you in the guts instead it is one of those books that deserves a re read where you can submerge yourself in the ideas words and moments while forgetting about the game moves a re read where you can get lost in the maze and not care for a way out","772":"lovely felt like what the grossman books would have been if they were more honest as andee said a lot of what you're looking for in palahniuk you can find here instead masculinity not as wish fulfillment or destructive to the outside world but just destroying yourself but also more hopeful than that","773":"good a little twisty and sometimes hard to follow but with a definite point of view and sort of melancholy inquisitive mood from the narrator an interesting book","774":"a unique and thought provoking piece of fiction about a strategy game conducted through the mail a few of the players who took the game too seriously and the creator of the game sean who started the game when he was 17 after a disfiguring accident you don't know the why of the accident until the very end although short it is dense and enigmatic the plot would seem to be evenful but somehow when you're reading it takes a back seat to beautiful language one point of resistance for me was a pervading feeling of an oddly flat and one dimensional world the flap copy told me that the author is a famous lyricist could that be informing his fictional style and is that a bad thing my favorite parts of the book were about the creation and maintenance of the game we learn about the flow chart sean used to make the game and how infinite possibilites from the players' perspectives are in fact predetermined limited choices this is a major theme of the novel what do we do with our choices wolf in white van doesn't remind me of anything i've ever read but i am not a big fantasy reader and perhaps there are some connections there i recommend this to readers who like to be challenged by literary fiction as well as those who have an interest in gaming who doesn't like to play games shortlisted for the national book awards it has gotten a lot of critical attention this year","775":" i just don't get it wolf in white van is written in a way that's supposed to be so intelligent deep and thought provoking that i feel like it's my fault that i don't get it maybe it is there has to be a reason why people have raved about it i'm sure it's one of those novels that you have to read again to really grasp it all but i don't think i can be bothered i was interested by the concept and forced myself to keep reading to see what the whole story was building towards i ended up skimming over a lot of the descriptive language in my desire to find out what happened but at the end i'm just as confused as i was in the middle i guess i'm supposed to be confused in a thought provoking way but instead i'm wondering why i wasted my time","776":"wolf in white van is a beautiful mysterious complex and compelling novel i have been thinking of it going over in my mind it's chapters it's labyrinthine cover and and it's labyrinthine pages since completing it and soon i will i have to read it over again i must admit john darnielle at the mountain goats have come to be one of my favorite bands and with his lyrical intricate song writing expressing entire stories in 3 or 4 minute pieces i had high hopes for this novel high hopes that were in no way disappointed and were in fact surpassed an exploration of the memories of sean a man disfigured in a terrible teenage accident he spends his time piecing together intricate worlds for other people to explore the post apocalyptic trace italian among other old fashioned play be mail fantasy games he shares his vision and imagination with others only to have once again tragedy strike as a pair of kids try to bring seans' world into their real lives with deadly results the trace italian with its vision of a devastated future america with a promise however impossible of a perfect world hidden in its interior strikes me as particularly apt a vision of the world many of us live in an extremely introspective novel sean is an unreliable narrator as he considers how the choices he made has effected his life and the lives of others like a choose your own adventure book or a roleplaying game every choice we make can have dire wonderful unimagined consequences what would happen if things went a different way wolf in white van is packed with wonder pain and sadness intricate details which will reward another reading i feel how our memory haunts our imagination our inner lives and our relationships with others how our choices make us and if there is any way we can make better choices all resonate through the novel without overpowering sean's story and darnielle's masterful descriptions reading it after terrible tragedy has stricken my own life darnielle's language and thoughtfulness actually brought tears to me eyes what new perspectives and ideas will i find in the next exploration","777":"i'm mad at this book for not being better john darnielle is such a clever and poignant lyricist but his prose writing is just a little off it's not bad it's just not great i felt like i could hear him leafing through his thesaurus a couple of times and this book is so interesting in concept a violent act with no easy explanation a story told in reverse to reveal a dark hidden meaning a la the backmasking referenced in the title but in execution it just falls flat i understand that the author doesn't want to give any easy answers but he leans so far in that direction that most of the novel's plot is completely inexplicable why are lance and carrie so drawn to this fantasy game that they suddenly believe it's real how does a lifelong interest in a comic book character translate into a sudden urge to commit suicide we never find out it feels long at 200 pages and that's a real shame","778":" this book i have somehow been reading a lot of books that present themselves as puzzles riddles to be unwrapped page by page some books obviously do this better than others and wolf in white van is one of them darnielle feeds you bit by tantalizing bit slowly filling you in on the big bad at the center of the story and yet although the book is so enigmatic the heart of the mystery is not the kind of paradigm shifting revelation of what it means to be human that the plot seemed to be moving towards it's better because it's real this book is the study of what it means to be human in all its mostly tawdry mundane realness it tackles the question of how one fills the interminable days of one's life how we process and deal with our relationships with others both familiar and strange finally this book underlines the ugly truth that sometimes we do horrible things for no other reason than because some part of us wants to see what will happen with no regard to consequences i recommend this book as i would any book that truly and fearlessly takes on the human condition because it is the kind of book that helps you understand yourself and everyone else around you just a tiny bit better","779":"there are no ready made and easy outcomes in wolf in white van unlike trace italian the 'choose your adventure' style role playing game invented by the book's narrator there are more options than answers here i never played d u0026amp d in earnest never read those adventure books and my familiarity with the mountain goats is cursory but i loved the structure of this book the story and the momentum with which it propels you forward it's one small thing i remember noticing in those months of building and making and drafting and plotting something that seems less small over time for a player to make progress he has to pacify or destroy whoever's in his way those people become part of his story he can't go back and breathe life into them and whatever he gains from the wrecks he leaves behind are permanent in the sense that any other courses open to him beforehand will them become closed","780":"reviewing this book is a difficult one for me because while i loved so many aspects of the book the whole thing just didn't come together for me and i have no idea why the content of the book was interesting and i really enjoyed the main character who i felt incredibly sorry for the entire way but yet when the book ended i didn't really feel much for it i think this book should've been more than it actually was having said that i did enjoy it and i will definitely see what else this author has done","781":"this is a wonderful moving haunting and very touching book about a young man who made an extremely bad choice and was left shattered to deal with the consequences of that choice i absolutely loved it and heartily recommend it to anyone who loves great literature","782":"3 5 maybe it's the subject matter but i am just not sure what to rate this book i would recommend it to read it's short and certainly draws the reader in","783":"this is beautifully written with a really intriguing concept but i wish i'd been drawn in a bit more so many tidbits in the periphery that are never expanded upon with quite the level of detail i would have liked i liked the way the main character's story unfolded though and i'll be reading any future novels by john darnielle who is an exemplary human being","784":"like his work as the mountain goats this is raw and painful and undisguised and from the outside and oddly fascinating darnielle wrestles with camus' one truly serious philosophical question here i'll let others summarize plot points and say only that the end of this backward moving novel approaches with such velocity as it leads up to the hours before the foreknown and defining event of the narrator's life that it feels like revelation despite its inevitability and despite its ambiguity and despite its grim confusion which is a really neat trick","785":"finished the book last night and this morning found myself starting again from the beginning had to stop and let the book live in my mind america guns mass murder but friendship life death","786":" darnielle's band is bland and uninteresting and the hype he has received as the best lyricist of his generation is wholly undeserved while i did not allow that view to cloud my reading of his first novel i found it to be much of the same dull and lacking in much insight and as obsessed with the obsessions pathetic role playing games and conan novels of the main character as telling a good or compelling story of some interest to the readers it is mediocre at best simply because it isn't badly written though we've seen the reverse narrative often enough not to be dazzled by that as so many were but it isn't the great debut of a writer who is going to astonish us in the future he will muddle along and perhaps produce more work and none of it will be better than average","787":"life on the margin of society very quickly immersive story that leaves you knowing what is inevitably coming good book","788":"i think this book was amazing it was insane i finished it the other day i need to reread it i would definitely recommend it read it and talk to me","789":"i have to preface this review by saying that i'm a big fan of the mountain goats and john darnielle's lyrics in particular a few years ago i got a hold of a copy of all hail west texas after one of my guitar teachers at old town school used \"the best ever death metal band out of denton\" for a twin spin a sheet of paper with a song on each side the cd was on heavy rotation in my car for months--i sang along tried to figure out strum patterns and marveled at the way darnielle created little mini novels in each brief song--songs about misunderstood teens fighting couples and the marvels of a newborn's gaze many albums later i had some catching up to do i'm still a fan so i was intrigued but not surprised by the fact that darnielle wrote a novel much like music of the mountain goats this novel might not appeal to everyone it's dense and complicated and dark it took a couple of chapters for me to get a feel for darnielle's rhythms but soon after i was hooked this is the story of sean philips who was horribly disfigured by an accident as a teen as sean lies recovering in the hospital he develops a complex role playing game that is played fully by mail the game is set in a post apocalyptic future and the players are looking for a safe haven called trace italian players write to sean with their next move and a small fee and then sean sends back information about the results of this move even after the internet hits this old fashioned game is still played by enough people to help sean pay his bills this novel starts in the present as sean is dealing with the aftermath of two of his players taking the game a bit too seriously lance and carrie two high school students wander off into the wilderness to \"find\" the next move and there are disastrous results sean is taken to court by one of the teen's parents but even though the case is thrown out the tragedy has a ripple effect--making sean think back to his own teen years however this makes the novel seem more straightforward than it is the narrative moves back and forth in time and we are totally mired in sean's psyche we see his teenage and adult obsessions we see how his life is now and we nervously notice that one plotline from the past seems to be leading up to the moment of sean's \"accident \" i'm not a big fan of re reading books unless a lot of time has passed but when i finished this i wanted to go back and start again i feel like there was so much i missed--maybe because i'm not a gamer or knowledgeable about conan the barbarian though i did see the movie about robert e howard with vincent d'nofrio and renee zellweger that didn't keep me from fully engaging in this book but it made me wonder about the layers i didn't see again i think this book won't work for everyone like darnielle's voice sometimes the writing style distracts from itself but i couldn't put this down","790":"i feel so sorry for this kid lost in darkness there are multiple instances where he is shown a better path but he does not take a hint","791":"my reviews are published on my blog","792":"i honestly don't know what to make of this book or how i feel about it i like it and dislike it at the same time i don't think i've felt that torn about a book in a while and for that alone i'm tempted to give it 5 stars but the frustrated part of me wants to give it 1 star hence the compromise at 3 the book is written very well and in a unique structure events start in the present and progress backwards until you get to the defining moment of the main character's life so in a sense you already know his outcome and his current state and the rest of the book is an exercise in understanding all that went before leading to his initial decision it's a personal growth story but backwards so it gives this an air of deep reflection rather than ascending realization i like the writing depth of the book and the main character but struggle with fully understanding and empathizing with the critical event however i feel that is more a reflection on me rather than the book author in that vein i say give it a read and judge for yourself the book is short so it makes for a fast read but the topic is dense and emotional giving it a slow and heavy feel it's not a feel good type of story and one that will challenge your empathetic depth in both good and bad ways","793":"this book was a bust for me it was like reading the super dark emo version of the inner life of adam goldberg's character in dazed and confused after finishing it i'm left wondering 'why ' and 'who cares 'from the back cover flap 'he is widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation ' maybe stick to writing songs then and isn't this a rather grandiose thing to say about oneself","794":" wolf in white van explores the thoughts and memories of a guy with a \"fucked up face\" as he deals with both past trauma and current problems written largely in flashbacks and recollections the order of the day is imagination and the remarkable thing about this book is that it can be read as both celebration and condemnation of an overly active fantasy life depending on your perspective and where your mind has gone as you turn the last page and close the book written in an authentic voice and with feeling and gallows humour the fairly short book manages to be engaging to the end - you find out why the previously mentioned face is fucked up fairly early on or at least you piece it together but you are drip fed the specifics and the circumstances until the very end it is engaging and just the right length and cleverly written - thoughts are hard to emulate and put on paper but the way the protagonist's focus shifts and how certain things are left behind and new details revealed works really well good stuff don't read it if you're having a bad day rating a bit more than 4 stars out of 5","795":"good but i think i need more closure or maybe clarity in my books i am frustrated and puzzled by the end","796":"definitely a book you must read with an open mind and at the right state of mind as it deals with a disturbed protagonist i finished this late last night and the book still has me thinking today it captivates your attention and i found it to be a page turner highly recommend it","797":" an inventive thoughtful well told story that i didn't like at all the grimness of the story was out of sync for me with the slimness of its themes if a book is going to put me through this much of a wringer it has to be about more thematically than the handful of characters in a book in casablanca when rick says it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world it works because of course casablanca is about the most important questions of all how to live what is important and whether individual sacrifice for a greater good matters in contrast the people in this book just don't matter that way even though they have much worse things happen to them i'm trying to defend my three star review of a well written book and i'm not sure if i'm succeeding but there you go","798":" \"i had come through the day no worse off than i'd come into it which as i have been telling myself for many years now is a victory whether it feels like one or not \"as soon as i saw that john darnielle of the mountain goats had written a book i knew i'd read it i just didn't know if i'd like it the mountain goats are something of an acquired taste and even if you enjoy the music you probably don't necessarily want to listen to it all the time sean phillips is a gamer and a fantasy fiction lover of which i am neither in fact the first chapter is fantasy heavy which made me worried that i would struggle to get through the book at all to say that i enjoyed the book would be incorrect - it didn't make me feel good but i connected with it thoroughly it touched me the same way that a darren aranofsky films touch me which is a compliment both shine a light on the dark places in our minds sean lives on the other side of where most of us would draw a line darnielle manages to tell his story with both objectivity and empathy this is definitely not a book that everyone will \"enjoy\" but i recommend it whole heartedly with one caveat major reviews have given away a significant piece of information about sean but if you can read the book without knowing it i think it would be much more affecting to learn about sean as the story unfolds","799":"wolf in white van by john darnielle singer songwriter of the mountain goats got a lot of attention when it was released because well it's a readable celebrity debut i didn't love it and i didn't hate it i guess it was just ok sean phillips is a hermit after surviving an accident that left his face disfigured he runs his business a role playing game called trace italian out of an apartment where he lives alone the game is played via mail - players send sean their moves in the game and he responds with the moves' effects he gets to know however distantly the trace italian participants through their writing gathering tidbits about their personalities and lives when a couple of players begin to take the fantasy world too seriously sean finds himself tangled in a debate of ethics and responsibility the review continues at awkward gazelle","800":"couldn't get into this book stopped after the second chapter guess i should have known a book about role playing games wouldn't be my thing","801":"this book is gonna stick with me for quite a while","802":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i knew after reading the first 12 pages that i was going to love this book the writing is gorgeous introspective and the word complete comes to mind probably because i feel so involved in the story and the mind of the main character sean wolf in white van tells sean's story from his point of view a point of view that the character has spent nearly his entire life cultivating as a world inside his mind sean was always prone to living in his imagination and after he disfigures his face i knew after reading the first 12 pages that i was going to love this book the writing is gorgeous introspective and the word complete comes to mind probably because i feel so involved in the story and the mind of the main character sean wolf in white van tells sean's story from his point of view a point of view that the character has spent nearly his entire life cultivating as a world inside his mind sean was always prone to living in his imagination and after he disfigures his face with a shotgun blast at age 17 his internal world becomes his total refuge he takes his chronic pain and recovery and channels it into an adventure game he invents a game similar to text based computer adventure games sean's game is played through the mail players mail him and he mails the moves of his dystopian world back move by move in this way he gets to share his invented worlds with people around the world controlling the destiny of people he has never met but feels kinship with anyway when two teenagers take the game too far however sean finds himself reexamining his life his motivations and his responsibilities this book is so well written that i feel clunky explaining it just read it more","803":"not my cup of tea i prefer a linear narrative firstly but i also didn't connect with the narrative at all the trace italian story got lost along the way and it never connected fully to sean's story either","804":"well written and carefully crafted super creepy and alienating","805":"reads as if neil gaiman wrote a ready player one type premise","806":"a little confused by the overall reading experience with this one i was pretty engaged all the way but ultimately felt like all the parts all the shifting dark moods and small subplots are not explored as deeply as i wanted them to be a lot of great scenes but they still felt unmoored at the end","807":"this is probably the most amazing book i've read yet in 2015 it's slim about 200 pages and yet darnielle packs more amazingness into those few pages then some authors manage to do with double or triple the space when i first read the blurb on the book jacket nothing about it screamed read me but the title kept catching my eye on book lists and so i finally picked it up as it turns out the blurb doesn't fully inform you of the literary genius inside the prose the story structure and the non linear timeline all come together to create something so complex that it's hard to really wrap my head around it for a review all i can really do is push the book at you and say you have to read this and be amazed the title is a reference to backmasking and also a clue to the structure of the novel the story unfolds backwards with the climax also serving as the starting point of sean's story read backwards in this case from page one onward the story reveals different elements of sean's story that don't present themselves if you follow his story in a linear sense there's joy hidden behind pain and vice versa there's also a correlation between sean's own pathway of choices and his game trace italian does one choice necessarily lead to another or is each one independently determined what would have happened if you opted for a different path would things have turned out differently or would you have ended up with a similar outcome anyway this is definitely one of those books that is read in a few short sittings but lingers in your head for days afterward i'm still turning over choice bits of the books in my mind i think this is one i'll buy for the express purpose of re reading and enjoying again in the future","808":"of all the books i have ever read this is my least favorite","809":" wolf in white van is the story of sean phillips a severely disfigured man who spends his time as a game designer for a mail in version of a dungeons and dragons meets the gunslinger type rpg called trace italian the book is a non chronological look at events in his life and how sean exists or doesn't in both his real life and fantasy worlds after his disfigurement from a shooting accident this book is much more about the use of language and conceptual ideas than it is about the setting character or plot the main character has many interesting thoughts and observations about the world he lives in but we never really get a sense of his actual emotions they can be filled in with the reader's empathy but they aren't really provided as part of the description perhaps an important part of this causes the reader to examine themselves how would they treat sean in real life sean is constantly confronted with being different his disfigurement causes him to remain on the outskirts of society and he hides in his home where he works at sending replies to people who participate in his games at one point he is confronted by a child who asks point blank what happened to your face the reader is left wondering if this frank blunt approach is any less painful than the way that the adults in the novel try to look away from sean or the way that his parents try to pretend the he and his accident don't really exist one of the driving forces of the novel is the fact that sean is sued by parents of gamers whose children attempted to live out the events of their trace italian adventure and ended up dead or dying because of it this is an interesting nod to the du0026amp d satanism scare of the 1980s with the adults in the novel attempting to blame every bad thing that happens on fantasy worlds and games of make believe yet still failing to face the reality of their own situations anyway while sean manages to find deeper connections to players he never meets than he does to people he interacts with in the real world despite the rpg backdrop and interesting themes this is a book that i found myself appreciating more than enjoying on an intellectual level i admire the use of language and i appreciate the themes that ran through the book but i never really found myself loving this book it is beautiful in a way but it is also disturbing and occasionally slightly boring the structure of the book almost makes it seem like the purpose of the story is to figure out why sean's accident occurred but once you get to the end it becomes apparent that that really wasn't the point of the book at all the story meanders through sean's life the way some of the players meander through his game seemingly with purpose but never really reaching an ultimate goal i almost feel as though i need to re read it to fully appreciate the craftsmanship of its construction and use of language yet i feel no actual desire to revisit this character or this world perhaps this is the sort of book that needs a lot of breathing room between reads as far as my recommendations go i think this is the sort of book that will either be loved or hated by a reader i've seen this recommended as literature for a genre nerd because of the rpg backdrop but i don't know if that connection will be enough to carry a reader through this novel genre readers typically enjoy a book with complex world building a dynamic plot and enjoyable characters considering that a notable portion of the story consisted of sean contemplating ceiling tiles i can't say that wolf in white van had any of these things though i also don't know that it matters i think this book accomplishes what it was trying to achieve and i think it does it very well i don't think it is going to convert genre loving folks over to the literary side but i suppose it might i think it is just as likely to leave them wishing for weighty text on dragon flights or warp drives in either case i think this is the sort of a novel that a reader needs to experience for themselves before deciding how well they like it personally i'm glad i read it even if it wasn't exactly a fun book to read i can't say that it will have the same impact on another reader though i think readers who tend to favor a book for its use of language will rather enjoy wolf in white van while readers who are more interested in character and plot may not it is the sort of book i would encourage people to try not because i expect everyone will like it but because i think it would be a good novel for expanding literary horizons","810":"3 5 worth reading","811":"john darnielle is a fantastic writer be it novel or song this book reads like a long mountain goats song if that's your thing","812":"this is a really great book i thoroughly enjoyed darnielle's writing style he writes like he is talking to you a really great unique tale highly recommended","813":"a this was a book i read it feelings happened this rating may change entirely tomorrow and then again the day after it is certainly beautifully written and i don't know how to react to it it's the kind of book where you read other people's reviews afterwards not to explain the plot but to get a sense of how you feel feelings as the narrator of this book would agree are immense things that often cannot be properly measured","814":"i'm interested in reading other reviews for this because i am curious to find out what others took from it","815":"i read this book in 3 hours that teenage darkness in all of us goes away but we never forget it","816":"i m really not sure of what i think about this book i'm going to think about it and go back and read some notes i made needless to say though not my favorite book i've read lately","817":" i started this book knowing nothing about it and it blew my mind a little i've tried to think whether i've ever read anything like it and the only thing that even sort of fits the bill is sebastian faulks' engleby in both books the reader somewhat painfully follows the workings of a clearly wounded protagonist's very unusual way of thinking only to be left wondering in the end whether the story's hero is a monster or something even more disturbing i had to sit and think for a bit after i finished it and i have a feeling i will keep thinking about it for a long while four stars instead of five because it's definitely not for everyone","818":"what a weird little book","819":"absolutely totally completely unforgettable this book wrecked me the story is devastating the writing could not be cleaner more direct and powerful an incredible work of art","820":" this has to be the most conceptually fascinating book i've read this year you'd think that a book told in reverse chronological order would be confusing or uninteresting but it's the complete opposite it's difficult to talk about it without giving away some major plot points but i'll just say that the story starts with our narrator alluding to an events that greatly affected his life and moves backward in time until we reach the moment in question it's incredibly cool and also one of those books that demands to be read over again as soon as it is finished i wanted to give myself a little time to marinate on it but since it's a relatively quick read i'm hoping to reread it again very soon and perhaps read it from back to front it definitely left my head spinning and had me wondering if i fully understood what was happening as it was happening as well as questioning what was reality and what was part of the game constructed by the narrator it's bizarre and awesome and i definitely recommend it see full review at www sparklescribble blogspot com","821":"some of the best prose i've read in awhile typically i struggle not to speed read books but with darnielle's book i savored every word and phrase he's a master of painting a picture or of unlocking an image the story itself is haunting and my only nit is that the second half isn't as cohesive as the first but still an enjoyable book i would recommend","822":"this is a pretty interesting look into the mind of a very intelligent yet very disturbed young man it explores the choices he's made that have greatly impacted his life and how he copes with them there isn't really much to this book besides his rambling thoughts but it was still a pretty decent read","823":"a fascinating look into the power and destructiveness of imagination turned escapism so so good","824":"2 5 stars maybe 3 very weird book about a guy who has a disfiguring accident when he is a teen about which you learn more as the story unfolds he has spent much of his life creating inner worlds and after his accident he develops a game that people play by mail i guess i expected something different based on the synopsis i read that initially made me want to read this","825":" a musician you like is writing a novel is rarely a sentence that inspires anything but outright primal fear but this is john darnielle of the mountain goats whose huge catalogue of songs is already a giant interlocking narrative and whose highlights like 'tallahasee' or 'the sunset tree' are narratively coherent in their own right 'wolf in white van' is an immersive and deeply affecting first novel it follows sean whose face has been disfigured in an accident when he was young the full details of this unravel over time backwards in fact much like the mail order game he creates trace italian the beautifully written novel follows themes that will be familiar to many mountain goats fans social isolation living on the margins finding solace in a game book or little quirk you see about the world you're looking in on that only you notice but that's where the inevitable music comparisons should end because this is a wonderful novel that hopefully marks a new career an exciting path that we have no reason to be afraid of","826":"i was expecting a more lyrical style something like his songwriting it wasn't there for the most part it would have helped what was essentially a pretty mundane story the game however the game was interesting and original i wish it had meant more i wish we had seen more of it","827":" while i can understand the accolades wolf in white van received from critics this extraordinarily dark and thematically discursive novel just wasn't for me i wanted escapist fantasy grounded by the author's attempt to reflect that fantasy back thematically onto the real world i wanted ready player one or the magicians what i got instead was a lot more like gillian flynn's dark places except without the thriller mystery element a glimpse into the complicated psyche of an unpopular teenager growing up in the dread 1980s a decade in which society became luridly obsessed with the content and purported real world effects of youth culture while there was perhaps a lot to like here i found the author's reflections on adolescence and life and fate and art however intelligent to be overall quite alienating","828":"if you were a nerd in the 80s 90s there's a lot of nostalgia to be had it is a reverse chronology exploration of a suicide survivor reminiscent of a character from preacher volume 1 gone to texas who goes on to create a wasteland fallout play by mail game the character development is well done and there's an eeriness as the onion is peeled as we work back to the initial event that set him on this course i really enjoyed the journey but i felt the conclusion left something to be desired i may have been too distracted while reading it but i got to the end of my ebook without realizing that this was the end there was just no more chapters","829":" so obviously i wanted to read this because it was written by my favorite living musician if not my favorite musician of all time there are certainly times when the language could be straight out of one of his songs i found myself re reading passages because normally i read really fast and i wanted to make sure the words all sank in because this is a book of words and not so much a book of story which is kinda why i knocked off a star i just felt like i wanted more depth i feel almost like i know some of the people in his three minute songs more than i know the characters in a 200 page book anyway jd is a master of writing characters living in dark haunted worlds punctuated only by brief flashes of light the troubled characters in this book remind me of golden era mountain goats songs so that is obviously a good thing","830":"i cannot fathom why this book has such seemingly stellar reviews it was taxing to read it seems like the sort of book people would call cerebral only to disguise the fact that it made utterly no sense i so wanted the story to be better than it was","831":" disclaimer i am a huge mountain goats fan i don't remember a book affecting me so deeply and so completely in a very long time darnielle's prose is masterfully minimalistic no surprise as he is a lyricist and conveys so much with a single sentence his main character's isolation and interactions with the outside world will have you alternately pulling out your hair and sighing with empathy while the reverse chronology may not appeal to some darnielle handles it very well the chapters engage with each other in a way that reverse chronology books usually don't making it a very well constructed and suspenseful experience but above all the book works it makes you think it makes you cry it doesn't give you an easy experience with a deeply complex complicated psyche of a very unhappy or at least resigned person it doesn't pull punches and it doesn't hold hands nor does it answer every question with a nice little bow on top but if you're looking for a book that masterfully combines symbolism cynicism and artistry look no further than wolf in white van","832":"exquisitely detailed and often diverting especially in the details of the game within the book but also brimming with messiness probably on purpose and loose ends perhaps less so and ultimately kind of a pointless or maybe just aimless faux memoir of a story you've heard before if you lived through the backmasking teen destruction wars of the 80s and 90s not bad but i can't recommend it either","833":"sean tells us the story of how he got his disfigured face and how in the intervening months of rehab he developed trace italian a very richly imagined text based snail mail game he runs to support himself i thought the first two thirds of the book were gripping and painful and told with beautiful language the last third just meandered through memories of how he made the game and his time in rehab the last few pages seemed to return to form and if it didn't resolve the main question it at least redeemed the last part of the story","834":"jesus god this is one of the best books i don't ever want anyone to read it hurt so much","835":"john darnielle does a masterful job of transporting the reader to utter isolation the problem is that i didn't enjoy being there in the least i didn't like the characters and i resented that he revealed the reason for the narrator's isolation drip by drip i also did not enjoy the early gaming world although it was an interesting peek into something i have never experienced i admit that darnielle did a good job at what he set out to do i just didn't enjoy it","836":"lyrical and interesting as i'd expect from jd i listed to the audiobook and i think his weird rhythm suited the prose not my favorite book of the year but i really enjoyed it as with a lot of great magic systems and world building in fantasy sci fi trace italian itself seemed interesting enough for it's own book","837":"i think i want to think about this or reread this before i render a true verdict definitely more of a piece with master of reality than any mountain goats lyric","838":" review http bennitheblog com bookbiters wo sean phillips is more or less a recluse after a disfiguring incident he crafts the game \"trace italian \" a post apocalyptic text based role playing game played in turns through snail mail as andrew wetzel of the masters review explains \"think of it like a choose your own adventure version of cormac mccarthy's the road \"sean is taken to trial after one of his teenage player accidentally kills herself enacting the game her companion suffers from serious injuries but lives wolf in white van is told in reverse chronological order a la memento that each chapter also contains memories and flashbacks makes it no small feat to try and follow the present it's like struggling to make sense of someone else's brain that happens to be rewinding itself the phrase \"wolf in white van\" itself is what you hear when you hear the lyrics \"we served at his table and slept on the floor\" from larry norman's \"six sixty six\" played backwards as for hidden messages sean himself ponders what i'd meant to ask her was why the devil would talk backwards why he didn't just get his message out directly by speaking clearly straight into the brains of the people he knew he could win over to me this was obviously the most important question about the whole thing because the devil's process as they'd described it sounded like a lot of hard work for almost no gain i've categorized this book as a \"mystery\"--it's not your typical mystery instead the question is what do we learn from this story when told backwards like sean's question regarding the devil why not present the story clearly in a chronological order sean's own situation seems inspired by the lawsuit against judas priest the band's manager bill curbishley was quoted for saying \"i don't know what subliminals are but i do know there's nothing like that in this music if we were going to do that i'd be saying 'buy seven copies ' not telling a couple of screwed up kids to kill themselves \"but there is power in the mysterious if the devil were to say \"give me your soul \" that could be easily dismissed or laughed off how much creepier is the message when it's something cryptic like \"wolf in white van\" something like that invades your thoughts commands your continued attention and maybe that's all the devil wants your time your focus while i don't dispute that record companies and bands don't want fans to take their own lives the very promise of messages in reverse helps sell records regardless of the actual content of the messages to get to the message of the book then first i will take a detour on a \"side quest\" i am one of those people who regularly reads materials at the end of the book--\"about the author \" \"acknowledgments \" etc here mr darnielle wants you to know that as the frontman of the band the mountain goats \" h e is widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation \" the best lyricist of course is weird al though no one has petitioned the white house that weird al be named poet laureate of the united states flavorwire and deadspin however have respectively called him \"america's poet laureate of musical parody \" and \"america's middle school poet laureate for 35 years running\" nor has sasha frere jones of the new yorker dubbed weird al \"america's best non hip hop lyricist \" these accolades can really get to one's head or there's some sort of irony here i'm missing because i'm less hip than someone more than a decade older than me or this is a punishing put down for not paying enough attention to mountain goats lyrics because i haven't never before have i taken offense at an \"about the author\" section but i did here i was already reeling from the ending where my initial reaction was \"that's it \" the \"best lyricist\" line presented on the following page seemed to taunt me \"unsatisfied with the ending \" it said \"well it's you not me 'cause i'm one of the best lyricists of my generation \"i suppose i was quite tired and stayed up a little later than i intended to finish the book open ended endings that \"make you think\" often stir an internal debate i get suspicious is it truly the best type of ending because of the themes in the book or is the author just stuck hoping by leaving things unresolved we ooooo and we ahhhh and call it a masterpiece ultimately wolf in white van did stick with me it having told the story in reverse as it did as sean states it's hard to overstate how deep the need can get for things to make sense and so i toiled to make sense of it all sean's options in life are few so he gets to play the omnipotent in \"trace italian \" of course the players never see all the possibilities only their own fates based on their own decisions these decisions of course are all preordained options planned in advance by sean himself moving back in time however we see how it was the very nature of open possibilities daunting as they are that led to sean's current situation he needs certainty as the god of \"trace italian \" the players have some small measure of choice but even sean is in control of their choices when players surprise him when they strip him of control--whether by placing their fates in the real god in acting out the game or taking action within the game outside of the prescribed options--it jars the very being of sean whatever he intended with \"trace italian \" all creations take on a life of their own when there's underlying despair how can an author help how a consumer receives it as much as i admire wolf in the white van i contend that at 224 pages the book is neither short enough nor long enough it could have packed more punch as a novella novelette or short story on the other hand i could also imagine a much longer tome that really explores more details let us live in sean's mind for even longer such that we'd find it difficult to untangle ourselves review http bennitheblog com bookbiters wo","839":"i really couldn't get into this novel for some reason i only read up to 100 pages or so and cut my losses","840":"i had a hard time getting into this book but once i was there i was there for good it reminded me a little of napoleon dynamite without the comedy glad it was a short book though","841":"i enjoyed the way this book creeped me out by drawing me in to the main character's insanity i'd call him the protagonist but he never really does anything the fight back from recovery from his accident has already happened and the entire novel just bounces back and forth through his memories so 4 stars for creeps and 2 stars for plot or lack thereof","842":"it's hard to convey how much this novel moved me this is certainly not a book for everyone you only get out of it what you bring to it it's a story of loss recovery and an attempt at redemption the fact that the redemption is unfulfilled is what make this book such a gut punch we follow the life of the narrator who is in a mental cage of his own making after a disfiguring incident he creates a mail order role playing game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland players mail in movements and he answers with outcomes and new missions it's what happens to a couple of these players that sets the narrator off on his journey of self reflection the author uses such extreme events to describe the affects of social isolation we see how his childhood obsessions inform his adulthood how others judge his interests and how this may have stunted his mental growth there are a lot of little details that seem insignificant but will be recognizable to anybody suffering the same sense of solitude hence what i mean by what you bring to the novel interestingly this reminded me of ready player one both are coming of age stories in a sense and both clearly reflect the authors' own upbringing i also think the enjoyment of both novels depend on the reader's upbringing while ready player one is a simple entertainment without prior knowledge of 1980's pop culture the simplicity of it can be underwhelming but wolf in white van also relies on one's own appreciation of how lonely adolescence can be how the attachment to certain music books or games can be your only outlet and how ultimately limiting these attachments can be this is apparently john darnielle's first novel and it feels like one it's very raw and very real despite it's brevity i wonder if he has another book in him i hope he does because it is a beautifully written character piece cinematic comparisons oslo august 31st the machinist","843":" a fun little puzzle of a book that reminded me of a lot of the feelings i have felt while listening to songs by the mountain goats sean feels like one of the characters in the the best ever death metal band in denton his story of isolation and loneliness feels like parts of get lonely the camaraderie and connection he feels with the players of his game reminds me of we shall all be healed and transcendental youth this book was like a fleshed out detailed mountain goats song which is just fantastic because the mountain goats are my favourite band and this was one of darnielle's greatest songs yet","844":"okay i only read 2 3 don't make me finish it","845":"this review will appear in the forthcoming post of the tulsa city county library's blog reading addict for anyone familiar with john darnielle the charismatic hyper literate force behind the charismatic hyper literate indie band the mountain goats probably already has a pulse on happenings in book and publishing circles the mountain goats music is characterized by rock songs with a strong focus on lyrics and storytelling often spinning three and a half minute yarns of adolescent outsiders the muck and mire and the anxiety of youth the hellish combination of being young and uncomfortable in one's skin here's a songsmith akin to jawbreaker's punk rocker cum english professor blake schwarzenbach song titles themselves often read like short story titles 'the best ever death metal band in denton' 'lovecraft in brooklyn' and the salinger eque 'michael myers resplendent' darnielle often waxes verbose about books he's reading or book's he's anticipating on any of his social media platforms he's active on twitter and frequently updates his tumblr page cue mention of his debut novel wolf in white van a debut so strong in many reviewers' and critics' eyes it's been longlisted for the national book award among much more accomplished novelists richard powers jane smiley and marilyn robinson to name a few wolf in white van is a curious and sometimes confounding novel my reaction upon turning the last page didn't quite elicit angels blowing coronation trumpets rolling out any carpet let alone one of reddish hue or bequeathing darnielle the oh my gosh how did you pull this off award the novel works in a hazy vaguely indecipherable timeline working backwards a more malleable time's arrow in which we the final chapter describes what has since been hinted at through subtle references and subtext as the narrative unfolds the reader learns our protagonist sean is horribly disfigured resulting from a self inflicted gunshot indeterminate of motive though self harm is the implication during the rehabilitation process sean creates a multiplayer role playing game a choose your own adventure type game played via the mail the prose is deliberate unadorned matter of fact narrative my frustration lies not with the style of prose which fits the content instinctually it's measured assured yet emotionally detached given the history and implication of the narrator this makes perfect sense this is a man so horribly disfigured he has no connection with any person other than the written moves players in his game make the sour taste i'm left with is the result of the final scene the final tableau of the novel the piece de resistance in which the accident is revealed betrayed so many of the clues and hints the reader was given about this person in the end this is less about a perks of being a wallflower outcast and more about a we need to talk about kevin distress","846":"i hope i do not ruin anything when i tell you that the why presented at the beginning of the novel does not matter it is possible as the beginning states that the why does not exist or it is impossible to parse or it is hidden but what matters in this book and what seems to matter most is the what next told in reverse chronological order this book follows sean philips in his life when he was a teenager he underwent a tragedy that has left him dramatically scarred in the face such that he can barely even leave the house he designs games in the through the mail dnd variety and lives a meager life when two of his young players undergo a harrowing event killing one maiming the other he is forced to consider his life sort of really we see the choices going back and again i find that the novel is less and less concerned with the why than in the consequences choices have them and we are given so many choices mostly hidden and when we make them the rest of our lives must follow in some way from that sean is trapped in this considering it and creating new choices for his players the writing is often rich though it sometimes feels abstract and weird and the way that the book unfolds is marvelous this was something i had heard about but managed to avoid having spoiled for me it is so much more and so much less than i had imagined and such a marvel for both","847":"my opinions as i read through this book i like this book i dislike this book i really like this book i hate this book in the beginning i thought that the mystery about the accident and the mystery about the trace italian game was interesting and had potential i liked it but then the strange writing style started to get to me half of the book is flashbacks internal monologues and ramblings about past musings on top of that the style is that of almost purple prose like a kid who has read too many bad comic books rpg books and manga and is applying that style to what he thinks is good writing i disliked it but then i thought what if that's the point what if the point is to show the internal world that is this disfigured kid's whole world because he has nothing else he makes up this imaginary world and reminisces constantly about idle moments of the past because he has no present and no future and furthermore what if the writing style represents that socially awkward self absorption that someone in that predicament would actually feel what if that's how someone living that life would actually write express those feelings if so brilliant i really liked it then the interludes with no context between chapters started to grate on me at one point the book goes through a list of what i think were paths through the game the interlude looked something like this texas oklahoma florida georgia kansas oregon washington colorado

washington colorado nevada texas kansas annoyed yet i was and this is a mere fraction of the list that went on and on and on with zero context if it at least tied into the story it wouldn't be so bad but it was a waste of time and was only made worse when the next interlude was some random list of items that also had no context to the story and story is a stretch there was no plot as a character study i think this book does pretty well but call me old fashioned i like a plot with my books i like some sort of progression of the story this book was the rambling dark internal monologue of a young man trapped in his own world and it wasn't particularly interesting aside from some trial concerning his game and some bad stuff that happened to some kids who took it too seriously his life wasn't all that bad he wasn't ridiculed aside from the initial shock at his appearance he wasn't harassed he didn't have to overcome any obstacle he didn't have to get a job or deal with relationships or anything he just existed in his own world dealing with his own thoughts maybe that was the point maybe the book really was about simply providing an insight into what it means to live with such a disfigurement and i would even have accepted that until the end the end that finally revealed what happened in the beginning the beginning that was completely random there was no reason behind it there was no cause and effect and considering that beginning that was the core of the entire book i felt like i'd been robbed of the payoff and so i hate it","848":"i have never read a book quite like this before it was sort of like the voice of holden caufield in catcher in the rye but set in the 1980s the story is told in the first person by shawn he is very disfigured and does not tell why until the last page of the book shawn makes money from developing a fantasy game that is played by clues but not on a computer people subscribe to it and he mails them clues he has a following from all over the world at one point i thought i was reading a young adult's book but it is very dark and disturbing","849":"i have nothing to say other than read this book just do it","850":"i had a lot of hope for this one after hearing about it on terry gross' fresh air it kept me interested it's a pleasant memory in general","851":"i visited my local book shop and asked for a recommendation and this is the book i chose i knew nothing of the author or the book i would love my time back this book just confused me and i felt nothing when i finished it","852":"sort of amazing but ultimately puzzling","853":"this is the kind of book where you take a pause from reading and look around surprised you're not still physically in the scene you were just reading","854":"a good book but not great it meandered a bit too much and tried to be a lot deeper and more intricate than it actually was and darnielle's prose while very good isn't quite up to his lyrical standards but it was still interesting to read and the prose and concept still enjoyable","855":"an excellent story about a man disfigured as a teen who creates an imaginary game to interact with the public he cannot face but when two teens take his game seriously he must come out in the sun to defend his life choices the story is short and is told in reverse it's great story writing and somber tale i especially loved the reason behind the title also in reverse","856":"deadly delving into the thought patterns of a whole but fractured man and the damaged boy he was darnielle keeps us entranced as sean relates his story thoughts imaginings and events are we dealing with an unreliable narrator or just with someone whose imagination is fractal diffuse but still clear read and find out especially if you grew up in the eighties as a misfit or caught the despair of the age recommended","857":" john darnielle had a powerful story to tell unfortunately he did not have the writing prowess to tell it his main character though convincing would impress minor league readers for he lacks the emotional turmoil to thrust him forward in the space the author places him the setting is in the psychic space of the protagonist which given the narrative would have made for an orgasmic story but it leaves you with ennui although this could be intended there are some good passages and convincing moments of prose that transcend above the typical which make it worth the read but being in the main characters mind makes death by trace italian the games he creates seem like a more worthwhile ending to the excruciating middle part of the narrative he is a good story teller and has a brilliant mind but you swim from the bottom of a deep end kicking to get to the top first out of excitement of being in the protagonist's mind then for survival he is a bit like holding your breath over a couple hundred pages which are revenge against good style technique and writing in the queen's language only to exhale at the end i will use it for my master thesis because the logic that informs it is better than the writing that delivers it","858":"gah couldn't decide three stars four stars i dunno i love john darnielle in his the mountain goats world i don't want to give him three i've given him three so there is lots i liked in this book the writing is great the story is interesting it's all a bit twisty and non linear there's a tragedy there's a game and it's pretty compelling all round in general i liked the tone and feel of the book and i think that ia what is going to stay with me for me the first half works way better than the second half the first half is four star material the second half drags a little i really really liked the descriptions of the main characters disfigured face i thought that was really well done and kind of horrifying and touching all at once way better than the schmaltzy wonder i felt that there is perhaps a bit too much going on here and as someone else said here on goodreads a few of the threads and storylines don't have any conclusion interesting glad i read it would read more by darnielle love him this didn't quite come together this is book 3 of manuary where this january i only read man books yes","859":" so i read this book and when i finished i tought wtf and ran to my laptop to try and figure out by reading reviews etc what it was that i just finished reading this is a bizarre book extremely well written somewhat without hope but with humor that describes a fascinating world of gaming that previously frankly didn't hold much fascination with me obsessed with obscure rock music conan the barbarian although not a complete loner or loser the 17 year old narrator has an disfiguring accident or more accurately incident as one reviewer wrote basically involving shooting off his face while recovering he invents a role playing step by step game trace italian about a post apocalyptic irradiated mid west and the quest to find and break into a impregnable fort he manages to make a living by charging a subscription to play trace italian advertising in obscure gaming magazines the book backs into the narrative and then finishes with what happened to him nothing i have just typed would have induced me as a reader to read it but once you get past the first two or three chapters others have described as laborious and i would agree the book its narrator his world and the question of why worm into your brain p s you don't get to know why but it is still well worth the read","860":"strange and but good","861":"didn't finish it made it about halfway through and wasn't into it","862":" i kept thinking this book was like a good taco when i'm hungry but someone left cilantro on it and so there's a soapy taste that makes the overall experience kinda unappealing even as i continue to consume it it's overwrought that's not useful criticism on its own because many of places someone could pull out and say this is overwrought worked well in greater context so almost a great book that i can only recommend as good overall i know this is vague it's hard say say if you like x try this book because it's not really a good match for anything else i can think of its topics and motifs that people might like but i can't say if you're into conan fan music try this because that's only part of the emotional setting it's not intended to bring in the fans on its own same deal with the text adventure by mail game or even the disfiguring disability try it if you like feeling morose it's not long i was hooked about 1 3 of the way through","863":" when he was a young adult a catastrophic injury left sean spending a lot of time in the burn ward of the hospital in pain and staring at the ceiling for countless hours during this time he invents in his head a play by mail roleplaying game called trace italian where survivors in a post apocalyptic america journey towards a fortress in the midwest after coming home sean is profoundly disfigured and he becomes a virtual recluse living with his parents creating the detailed landscape of the trace italian game and venturing no farther than the local liquor store to buy candy he places ads in the back of science fiction magazines and starts corresponding by mail with people who play his game as the novel opens the reader gradually realizes another tragedy has occurred and two young trace italian players have taken the game too far into real life the story goes back and forth in time but is never confusing secret signals death metal obscure magazines conan the barbarian comics mail order swords and homemade cassette tapes form sean's inner and outer landscape the fact that the main character is living with extreme facial deformity reminded me of wonder by rj palacio but whereas that was an ultimately hopeful book this is sadder and interior more literary fiction it also reminded me of the burn journals by brent runyon","864":"as someone who likes role playing games rush and yes and lived through the 80s and 90s this book resonated to me a dark and morbid story but told with a freshness and tone which should be heard by many people i used to play the postal turn based role playing games and i loved this element of story being recited i've meant to read this book for a long time and am glad i finally have","865":"john darnielle's debut novel wolf in white van is the winner of the 2015 alex award for adult books with special appeal for young adults darnielle takes his protagonist sean on a journey he never intended to have after a failed suicide attempt sean's left with a mangled face and mangled is an understatement to escape the engulfing depression that follows sean creates a role playing game set in a post apocalyptic world but when two of his players take the game far too literally sean's once again faced with the alienation he has worked so hard to step out of literature has always been a voice for those who feel marginalized and ostracized but darnielle masterfully takes this novel to a place we haven't been before sean's role playing game is a metaphor for his reality like the people traveling through his fantastic role playing adventures he's fighting to stay alive and find meaning in a world where the odds are incredibly stacked against him","866":" i love the mountain goats and i loved last plane to jakarta so i knew his writing would be good there were a lot of things to like in this book nice moments and observations but ultimately it kind of lacked emotional resonance for me in the end i couldn't really relate and there wasn't much takeaway for me and i shouldn't have to be a socially awkward alienated southern california boy of a certain era with certain tastes in pop culture to be able to relate that's what the writing is supposed to do i'm sure others feel differently and i'm glad for it","867":"contemplated a 1 star rating but this is pretty well written however it would never make my top 100 books of the year list as it did for amazon i was expecting a good payoff at the end and or some resolution you get neither","868":" john darnielle's pertinent brief gem of a novel \"wolf in white van\" centers on video game role playing and the perilous interaction between reality and fantasy sean philips disfigured since he was a young boy creates imaginary worlds for strangers to play in it is a story within a story but when players lance and carrie take their adventures out into the real world danger strikes the line between real and imagined blur when an actual murder occurs outside of philip's video game \"trace italian \" leaving both his reputation and livelihood at stake unfolding in reverse order from its stunning climax to the beginning where the reader learns of sean's unfortunate life altering circumstances this brilliantly beautifully constructed debut novel is a must read for readers of psychological thrillers strongly recommended","869":"it isn't often that a book i've only just read becomes an instant favorite i tend to realize just how much i've enjoyed a novel only when i find myself recommending it to friend after friend after friend it is perhaps because i can't do this with john darnielle's wolf in white van that i bonded with it so quickly this is not to say that wolf in white van is a bad novel or somehow undeserving of its award nominations gamers particularly those who enjoy role playing games and are either gen xers or older millennials will latch onto this title as i did its nostalgic appeal doesn't extend much further however so readers who aren't familiar with rpgs or the 1980s may find themselves in foreign territory wolf in white van drips with '80s paranoia over the effects of dungeons and dragons among other occult games on teenage minds in darnielle's novel the fears of the general public clash with those of players themselves the suspicion that role players are in danger of losing touch with reality clashes with the idea that the naysayers may be right the question of whether or not the narrator's interests have done real harm haunts the novel the text doesn't fall to one side or the other of this fence leaving the biggest answers open to interpretation it's unfortunate that wolf in white van wraps up as quickly as it does although it doesn't neglect to cover anything because the first 80% of darnielle's novel is so carefully developed the denouement feels rushed and haphazard there are no real surprises there what happens is exactly what you have expected despite its few shortcomings wolf in white van is a brilliant first novel and one that thankfully has not been overlooked by the literary community pick it up if you're a gamer nostalgic for the 1980s or if you were a kid with dreams and creative aspirations bigger than yourself","870":" whilst darnielle's turns of phrase and constructed sentences are beautiful and dark the actual meat of the book in terms of plot and character development is lacking although this might not be surprising for a novel with a non linear structure about an isolated incredibly damaged loner of a protagonist i found myself pretty unengaged and disinterested in what happened to the characters the resolution of plot threads and the central mystery the themes of the novel of redemption that shaun is desperately seeking from his parents as symbolized by the unobtainable trace italian in his game of control of one's destiny and the ability to make choices which is presented time and again as a facade felt overdone by around three quarters of the way through in many ways this felt like a very long novella it presented an interesting narrative and explored some compelling themes but it lacked a third act it's a series of very interestingly written vignettes with cutting observations beautiful simile and profound turns of phrase but the framework they're hung upon left this reader wanting","871":"beautiful and haunting i am a mountain goats fan and so when i saw he had written a novel i was immediately interested turns out he is as talented a novel writer as a song writer an unnerving reflection on two of my favorite themes coming of age and being an outsider the lack of a 5th star is just because it is less of a fully developed novel than a sketch and i am left feeling unsatisfied in much the same way as after reading a short story","872":"every little story in this heart breaking novel opens a window into the armour that people build around them and teaches us how to look beyond their scars and inside the same white van that everyone drives","873":"i felt my insides engorged from a nostalgia for a fullness and terror of youth","874":" 3 5 stars i honestly find myself at a loss for words here just unsure how to rate or talk about this book while i was reading i was invested i was really feeling like it was something special but as it ended it felt to me like the story didn't take you anywhere i imagine a lot of it is intentional but there is so much unexplained so many unfinished plotlines keep in mind that this is something that doesn't typically bother me that much so even saying this i'm not pinning down what bothered me about the ending of the novel it just felt empty which again is probably the point but i digress i feel it's worth a read particularly if you are moved by the lyrics of mountain goats songs darnielle is a damned fine writer i feel like i should give this one a year or two and then reread it and see what i feel about that ending","875":"moving and incredibly interesting i admire the author's commentary on man's search for meaning and found the narrative compelling as well i did as an eternally cheerful optimist have some difficulty empathizing with some of the angst but it was beautifully done","876":"i'm not really sure how i feel about this book i think i'd have to read it again to know for sure but since reading it the first time took so much time and effort i don't see that happening anytime soon the story is told from sean's point of view starting with him as an adult and flashing back to various time periods somewhat willie nilly to slowly give you a complete picture of what happens in the story view spoiler essentially sean shot his face off with a shotgun for reasons even sean doesn't seem to know whim loneliness ennui that alone i found annoying the rest of his life is spent in semi solitude because no one can bear to look at his face after reconstructive surgery in the aftermath of surgery sean invents a mail based rpg choose your own adventure called the trace italian which supplements his income two kids decide to make the game real and freeze to death hospitalization in the process and sean is unsuccessfully sued the prose was skillfully written but so introspective and unwavering in emotion that i fell asleep at least 3 times while reading it i think the structure made the story circuitous in the hopes of creating more meaning by the difficulty of reading it backward hence the reference to wolf in white van in the title no one quite knows what this story means but feels sure it must mean something hide spoiler red flags cursing gun violence death","877":"i don't get the fascination it is a drab story full of an overthinking main character that is intended to be suspenseful","878":"too depressing","879":"update i read this book back in september october 2015 and i still randomly think about this book and how cool trace italian is therefore 1 star","880":"wordsmithing of a quality that should be expected from a man i have frequently referred to as the greatest living lyricist","881":" after an injury that left him disfigured sean phillips creates the world of trace italian a post apocalyptic world where players navigate a wasteland in order to seek sanctuary in kansas the book navigates through sean's life as two players of the game carrie and lance take their trace italian adventure into the real world with disastrous results working backwards in time from that moment the creation of the game and how sean came into his facial disfigurement are revealed in a disjointed but easy to follow path through time john darnielle weaves nostalgia through a story that is very rooted in the moment the game of trace italian is a relic of an age of choose your own adventure that players are given options on how to precede mail in their moves and receive the next part of their story back through the mail while odd at first it's impossible to see the game working in any other way however darnielle still keeps us in the moment and you never get the feeling that sean is stuck in his own nostalgia in fact sean makes the point that the person he was before the accident is a person who no longer exists it's a very quick read and the ending sneaks up on you even quicker you're not sure you're on the last chapter until half way through it and you don't realize until it's too late that the story could only end this one way at it's core the wolf in white van is about imaginary landscapes and how we use them to escape into ideas and scenarios that allow us to deal with the world at large and how getting lost in these imaginations of the world can lead to moments that change our paths immediately and permanently leaving us to wonder what might have been and to imagine new futures for ourselves","882":"with a pace as slow as playing a monthly choose your own adventure game and no actual plot to speak of this meandering novel is more of a languorous leisurely examination of the randomness of life and the long term effects of the choices we make than a gripping page turner because hey life doesn't have a coherent plot or readily understandable simplistic character motivations right right that's why my life would make a shit novel even if i shot myself in the face tonight because of reasons which i'm not going to i didn't enjoy this book very much","883":"this was a good read with interesting insight into the isolated life of the narrator but i can't help feeling it could have been better still worth reading though","884":" the first 15 20 pages introduces that our main character sean is different and dark it's a challenge to sink in at first but then the book takes off as his story unravels in reverse stick with it on the surface i feel about as far away from sean as i might any character and yet i very much connected with his reckoning with the different versions of himself how much he has changed over the years it's a dynamic i think of often i wrote about this once http www saramcguyer com 2013 12 yo","885":"the writing style is a little unique but does t seem to mesh with this kind of story thank god this is not a long book and not that much of a waste of time","886":"honestly not sure how to feel about this one it was interesting and well written but ultimately disturbing i don't think i recommend","887":"this was a very strange very ambitious very literary book there were times i really liked and admired it and there were other times i found myself bogged down and confused in the end it's good writing and an interesting story but i'm not sure i truly liked it it felt kind of like jazz impressive but not that much fun to listen to","888":"what a strange and beautiful book","889":"brilliant if i taught hs english this would be a must teach book","890":"i could read this book a hundred times or more and still get lost in the sentences in the sadness in the complex beauty of it i feel like there's something about it i don't understand and maybe it's like the end of the game and never meant to be met but i will have to read it again and soon there are few books in the world that you need to read again immediately after finishing this is one of them","891":"i can't decide if i liked this book or not it was so full of empty spaces sometimes i found myself staring at it instead of reading","892":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i was expecting a little more out of this book than it delivered however it wasn't a disappointing read somewhat depressing and riddled with a few relatable quotes darnielle does a good job in interspersing points of sean's life throughout the novel to create a disjointed but interesting story normally i'm not a fan of telling stories backwards however it worked very well for the ending i found the ending poetic in a way the fact that the novel ends with sean's attempted suicide kind i was expecting a little more out of this book than it delivered however it wasn't a disappointing read somewhat depressing and riddled with a few relatable quotes darnielle does a good job in interspersing points of sean's life throughout the novel to create a disjointed but interesting story normally i'm not a fan of telling stories backwards however it worked very well for the ending i found the ending poetic in a way the fact that the novel ends with sean's attempted suicide kind of mirrors how it was the death of sean's first self more","893":"p interesting","894":"a fine book a hymn for those who inhabit lonely universes","895":"fiction violence psychology role playing games unique and thought provoking","896":"haunting different and very interesting as someone who did a ton of play by post roleplaying in my teenage years it was fascinating to read about that world in relation to this dark story not the most fantastic writing but i enjoyed it","897":" i don't even know what really happened in this book just a lot of narration and confusion i'd like to say it was like david lynch brilliant but i can't it wasn't it's not the cover is so intriguing but the text itself is not i don't have many thoughts i thought it was going to have more action and i think my thoughts prior to reading it had too much expectation overall i didn't really mind the story but the style of the writing and the chronology of it was annoying and confusing i am happy to move on to another book after i try to figure out which book to read next","898":" john darnielle has been popping up in my life a lot over the past year i've really gotten into the mountain goats he's been a guest on one of my favorite podcasts judge john hodgman he had a blurb on the back cover of that incredible andre the giant comic that came out a few months back and now he has the audacity to write a novel and it's great he sucked me in with the very strange but beautifully specific mail based post apocalyptic adventure game the protagonist runs and then delivered with the pitch perfect emotional resonance i've come to expect from his music","899":" full disclosure i'm biased towards the author being as he is among my favorite musicians that said this is an incredible debut for darnielle as a novelist a spectacularly introspective piece proof that darnielle knows his character very well he's an expressive writer that doesn't bore you with semantics i read the entire novel in a single sitting but this is the sort of novel that requires a second read my only complaint is that he manages to reveal the ending far too early but the novel keeps you along for the entire ride regardless in short i won't hesitate to pick whatever john darnielle publishes next","900":" this fucking book i wasn't going to give it 5 stars i really wasn't i was dead set on 4 then i read the last page followed immediately by the first part of the first chapter why john why do you do this to me why can't you just make life simple in all seriousness though this book was lacking i felt like each chapter could have gone on for 3 or 4 times as long as they did and i s to ll would not have tired of them i also felt as though there is enough unspoken information in thus book to write another 2 novels i love john darnielle as the mountain goats and now i love him as an author call me a fanboy but what we have here is one of the most under appreciated artists of our time 5 out of 5 after heavy consideration","901":"beautifully written but structured in an unwieldy way that draws attention away from the thoughtful themes","902":"i love the mountain goats and this slim novel was gorgeously written however i'm left with a major level why at the end it seemed like possibly the most crucial part of the main character's backstory came out of nowhere maybe that's what darnielle intended as he said this is why people cry at the movies because everybody's doomed either way i feel the powerful need for a literary palate cleanser now something at least mildly hopeful next","903":"this is in my view a small but perfectly formed book a book about a harrowing set of circumstances beautifully told a book that provides no answers and very little in the way of explanations but is the better for that it took me just over 2 hours to read it and now 24 hours later i'm still thinking about it i don't want to say too much about it because i think you should all just read it for yourselves and see how you feel about it","904":"whoooaaaa super mixed emotions after this one","905":"it was good but i feel unsatisfied and confused i think i'm supposed to feel that way","906":"i really didn't like the first half character development was minimal i was motivated mostly by trying to figure out what had happened the writing often felt clunky a parody of what john danielle would write if he were writing a novel in the second half i started to appreciate a bit more what john was up to with this book maybe he succeeded in the end it felt confused and true and made my soul hurt in a way i really don't like","907":"this book was so weird i liked the writing style and the maincharacter sean felt pretty honest and unique but till the end i didnt got the meaning of the book it went kind of nowhere and suddenly it was over","908":"really lovely prose very dark story unexpected and haunting","909":"i really loved this book so interesting and original","910":"books by musicians i've found are continually risky i can hear at least two of my close friends saying but wait john darnielle and i would simply respond with how much i didn't care for colin meloy's efforts and the two of them are both good lyricists still when wolf in white van hit my library system i made sure to put a hold on it then it got nominated for a national book award okay so i guess i'm in award nominated i'm a fan of the mountain goats so i dive in on a book where my expectations were understandlibly tempered and ended up finishing the book over the course of the evening as it's one of the more poetic straightforward enjoyable contemporary reads i've consumed in a while the story is a little fractured which only helps with the reveals along the way we have a murder wrongful death case it involves a man who has been significantly disabled due to an accident i don't want to give too much away and he also ran a roleplaying game by mail service these are all interrelated issues and we get a peek into his childhood and upbringing along with his mentality along the way it's the tale of a broken person or broken people and has enough cultural touchstones and references to go along with the tale to end up being a very different story than what i normally read and one i really loved whether this breaks a lot of new ground in the sort of literary fiction universes that i don't spend a ton of time in that's for other people to say the book however deserves every accolade it's gotten and is definitely something i recommend for everyone really solid book","911":"a very different kind of story","912":"found myself not giving this book the fullest of my attention but was knocked flat by certain passages i'm just thinking i had too much on my mind to fully immerse myself in it","913":"'wolf in white van' was a confusing and splintered world at best the writing at times demonstrate a superficial level of insight into the dark path of isolation otherwise most of the time leaves you lost it's saving grace is that i did want to play the game 'trace italian' when i finished it's creator's story","914":"this book was a little difficult to follow at times but it was a good quick read","915":"the highlight of this novel is the rich use of language which allows darnielle to draw his reader into multiple fictional worlds and moods it's easy to empathize with the story's protagonist although i wondered how reliable of a narrator he was he reminded me of a sadder but wiser holden caulfield","916":" it's trace italian that's going to linger with me i'm never truly absorbed in the plot or the writing until trace italian but god how powerful is that game's hooks on your imagination i'm not sure i could fully sympathize with our narrator and i was a little disappointed with where the plot took us or rather failed to take us we have a protagonist defined by one enormous action that leaves him disfigured and the rest of his life full of inaction he stops making games he stops leaving the house he loses contact with anyone he cares about he's frustrating and he lets his disability take more from him than it would have but how could i possibly give a lower score to the book that gave us trace italian","917":"life as a choose your own adventure type of game where each choice brings more choices until they fall into a sea o meaninglessness or maybe it's the opposite maybe each individual choice is so powerful we in turn become powerless it's hard to tell due to the almost apathetic nature of the book a self defense mechanism no doubt where no questions are truly answered and we are left with only profound loneliness melancholy and despair our protagonist will forever be an outcast stuck in a perpetual high school gloom trying to quench or is it fuel his inner darkness through pop culture with escapism as both doom and savior","918":" tragedy in a literary sense is usually ordered like conspiracy theories mysteries crime writing reportage tragedy tries to arrange all of the pieces so they resolve resolution is somehow easier for us a way we can accept even the unusual or monstrous by giving everything a cause or a reason this is what separates tragedy from actual grief tragedy gives us release grief gives us acceptance wolf in white van reads like grief it gives flashes of a greater framework in which to place it a compelling story with a resolution but any piece when examined fails to resolve properly like trying to listen to rock music backwards to divine satanic messages any serious examination proves unsatisfying to anyone but those already convinced of their existence an purpose it's a book that talks about loneliness without ever feeling lonely about the strange and unchosen effects we have on each other without ever wanting or meaning to the intimacy of a shared situation it's a book that invokes tension in the form of trying to ascertain or explain a terrible thing and release in the final acceptance that explanation is beside the point h p lovecraft thrives on the unknown and ineffable as a vehicle of horror darnielle to me delivers the feeling that the unknown is much larger than we think and maybe that's okay","919":"a solid debut novel from one of my favorite songwriters i can't wait to see what comes next","920":"just tremendous i've been a mountain goats fan for years but was wary to say the least of darnielle jumping from one medium to another attempting to twist success as a songwriter into success as a novelist so awful ends in embarrassment for both writer and reader but this wasn't just great as a novel by a musician in love it's one of the most stunning novels i've read in quite a while not least for its resonant and pitch perfect channelling of the confused alienation of an adolescent no longer able to communicate properly with either his parents or himself the prose alone is worth the price of admission tight well controlled and continually evocative and moving what a book","921":"this book got into my head i had a fast read of wolf in white van by john darnielle because of how compelling the story was fast like two days during the workweek luckley it is a short novel around 200 words because once i finished it i wanted to immediately read it again the story is structured with the plot time line running in reverse along the same rhythm the language is at times choppy and distracted on purpose following the internal dialogue of the protagonist if i had been an english major i would have plenty to analyze tthe story follows a man sean dealing with his own attempted suicide as a teen that leaves him with a disfigured face this is not a good book for anyone with sensitivities to the subject of suicide my favorite part is the descriptions of the sean's play by mail game that he created and operates from home i found sean a kindred spirit he spends lots of time in his own head creating his own world and dealing with the difficulties of being an extreme introvert darnielle has created a distinctive story that i am not soon to forget and will often recommend to others thank you kelly k for the book recommendation","922":"different from what i'd usually pick up and really unsettling but i thought the structure worked well and there were plenty of parts that left me thinking","923":"brutal honest deeply imaginative stunning all over","924":"really interesting novel unlike most anything else i've read before yes it is bleak and not much really gets resolved but i found it a fascinating look into the mind of a person who feels out of place in the world around him","925":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here brilliant although it discusses serious topics wolf in white van is a brilliantly written book full of beautiful descriptions it's a book about rash decisions and the consequences that follow it's about growing up and the time you spent inside your own head while doing so it explores regions we all

although it discusses serious topics wolf in white van is a brilliantly written book full of beautiful descriptions it's a book about rash decisions and the consequences that follow it's about growing up and the time you spent inside your own head while doing so it explores regions we all have wandered in at some point in our lives but goes farther my parents would have asked the younger me what do you want to be safe from after the accident nobody would ask that was to put it harshly the best thing about the rifle blast that destroyed most of my face wolf in white van is a character study if you will after finishing it i felt like there is more depth in there than i thought i feel that if i read this again now knowing where it's headed i will reveal even more layers of the labyrinth that is the protagonists mind it was one of those kind of books that really impressed me with their writing style and left me with a bit more than a engaging story it left me something to think about be it for just a few minutes or even days i love those kinds more","926":"this took me awhile to get through the juxtaposition of the game and the real world was fascinating but that was the only thing i liked there were just too many subplots and it just never came together for me","927":"it's really hard to place this book it's ultimately about isolation confusion bullying and the inner dialogue of a boys teenage years the narrative peals away clues as to the nature of his accident but its really more about the collection of moments in the book definitely unsettling and something i'll be hard pressed to forget","928":"just finished this and it's going on my favorites the content is so complex but the narrator is really concise so it's not a super hard read but you still have to take your time with it this book pissed me off so much i'm 18 so i'm sort of on the cusp of adulthood so i'm going to have a lot of important things to think about over the next few years but literally all i'm ever going to think about for the rest of my life probably is this freakin' book it's so short and there's so much crammed into it it's a bottomless mindfuck god damnit screw you john darnielle for locking me in your weird medieval nerdy philosophical lair to think about things forever","929":" honestly this book pained me like another reviewer i chose it from my local library because of the awards it won and because it was short however i think i could have read war and peace faster every few pages i debated whether or not to to give up and cut my losses and or to just give up and cut my throat i doubted myself and figured there must be something i just wasn't getting or that would all be made sense of in the end i also tried figuring what purpose if any the process of writing and or reading this novel could serve work through a traumatic experience document recurring nightmares empathize with the mentally challenged feel good about myself by comparison in the end like a bad dream i was just glad it was over","930":"amazing beautiful frightening one of the best i've read this year any year that this novel is haunting is not enough it wraps itself around you and slowly squeezes until you can't breathe","931":" john darnielle's novel is an engrossing immersion into the mind of sean who is living with the consequences of having attempted suicide as a teenager we slowly learn about the physical damage wrecked by that botched attempt and about his parent's struggle to understand why he did it the tenor of sean's inner dialogue is neither bitter nor tortured which helps to carry the reader through what is a fairly dark story we also explore sean's means of escape his construction of an elaborate perilous fantasy world and its sole refuge the trace italian he turns this fantasy into small living yet even this is not safe from tragedy the narrative switches between sean's present life his memories of earlier times and his explanations of this alternate fantasy and the games in which it features this provides variety and contrast and allows key events to be hinted at and slowly revealed the ending provides little in the way of resolution we are left wondering both what will happen next and without much more of an understanding of what happened in the past if there's anything as simple as a message there maybe it's that we're capable of doing stupid things that have terrible consequences for no good comprehensible reason and yet the book is far more intriguing and less depressing than this would suggest","932":"\"you should avoid seeing too much of yourself anywhere in the outside world in others in the imagined worlds that give you shelter \"without being mopey or self pitying this book is about escapism and loneliness it is the smartest sharpest parts of the worst moments of your life it is beautiful and painful and real","933":"deep dark and deliciously weird definitely my kind of book","934":"yeah not sure i get the hype about this book it never grabbed me i didn't connect with the main character and i really didn't get where this was going as an avid gamer i really wanted to like this but nothing really gelled with me unfortunately sounded like a great concept but just didn't work for me in the end","935":"i only wish it were longer honestly but there is something to be said about precision and concision","936":"i wanted to like this but i don't think i did i appreciate the complicated story telling technique and almost lyrical writing but this was too depressing too dark too weird for me to like i ended the book feeling hopeless and though i finally could put together the puzzle i didn't like the picture it formed it was as if the whole thing was meaningless which i suppose was the point but the whole experience was too unpleasant for me to recommend","937":"2 5 stars i found this well written but was left feeling frustrated that the narrator refused to give answers even when he was able to","938":"i heard a lot of hype about this book but was not overwhelmed the author writes well and the story is somewhat compelling but it may be too horrifying a story for me to recommend to a student deals with suicide thoughts of offing entire family and it was a bit jumbled during some parts","939":"gorgeous writing and a really persuasive deep dive into the head of a troubled young man but just a bit too elliptical while touching and thought provoking by the end i still didn't feel like i understood what drove him","940":"i loved this book what a beautiful writer a sad main character but an artfully woven story","941":"this was just bad i listened to this as an audiobook and it was largely an unpleasant experience and i would not recommend this book","942":"really liked this book found it totally gripping i really have no idea what any of the source material referenced is about and i wonder what i'm missing the narrator was fantastic compassionate thoughtful and truthful","943":"a good idea that falls far short in the execution i kept being forced out of the character's voice by the intrusive unsteady author's voice","944":"this book is very strange john darnielle certainly can write u0026amp at times i was riveted by what i was reading but the flow of the book u0026amp how much i grew to dislike sean's character i mean i get it i get it all getting lost in these make believe worlds with his conan u0026amp the trace but because i cared so little about sean kind of how little he cared about himself that i just didn't really like the book that much overall","945":" wolf in white van is all about escapism and regret john darnielle tells the story of sean a young man who in a tragic accident disfigured himself and while recuperating comes up with the game trace italian trace italian is a text based mail adventure game that forces its player to try to get to the center of a base surrounded by fortified triangular walls the trace is a metaphor for life and the unattainable center that we can never truly reach the book kind of drills this point in so much that at times i was screaming okay i get it but overall it flows really well and fit my mood this book isn't highly quotable and can come across as pretentious at times but it's really not that bad or good it's middle ground it's a dark young adult book and if you like the mountain goats or want something out of the norm it might be for you","946":" i feel like this book was written by someone who loved the mountain goats and was trying to write like they think john darnielle would it seems too dramatic and too depressing loving darnielle and the mountain goats as much as i do just left me a little unimpressed at the apparent lack of effort that john put into his book i would have liked to have seen some sort of ground breaking effort on the part of darnielle in this book but it seemed to carry the same style and feeling as many of his songs but made into a slow moving book i did like that the mountain goats song you were cool got stuck in my head almost every time i cracked the book open","947":"crudely we're in the world of vernon god little river's edge and the arcade fire's the suburbs but far better far more daring this is a book of reverberations and beats any other novel i've read this year","948":"review coming need time to process","949":" i don't know this just wasn't written for someone like me there are images and moments that are very good but it is a very sad story and i just didn't understand what it was about i think that is intentional actually there is no real reason behind the suffering that happens in this book but it is self inflicted so there is just so much suffering that is incidental that what does it mean for someone to sort of randomly inflict suffering on themselves to deal with a lifetime of consequences for a randomish act it is sad i just felt sad","950":" i wanted this book to be great because i could identify strongly with the narrator and the prose really is fantastic it's almost like a 200 page poem just like this kid i was fascinated with conan in middle and high school and wasn't exactly the most popular kid in my class unlike him i never thought of shooting myself thankfully i guess what made this book fall a tad short for me was that i wanted more it turned out to be a nice snack of a read and i was wanting a feast this book's overall lesson if you're going to maim yourself for life with a shotgun shouldn't you at least know why the heck you did it","951":"beautifully written non linear narrative of a young man following a horrific injury to himself and a life changing event in the lives of two teenaged players of the mail order role playing game he invented that doesn't do it justice though i'm not sure how to describe this book it was sometimes intense sometimes disturbing sometimes humorous personal and insightful very original and totally unforgettable","952":" although the premise of this book was intriguing i found it didn't hold my interest i'd put it down for stretches before i'd convince myself to pick it back up again i can appreciate the author's intent to have the reader slowly unlock the real story behind sean's accident and what happened with lance and carrie but the pace just wasn't quick enough for me and despite the kind of meandering story telling style i still don't feel like everything was explained by the end interesting but sad definitely a haunting quality","953":" what an odd little book odd as in i'm not sure how i can describe it or explain a plot i couldn't tell if the main character sean was mentally ill or if he was an absolute optimist the storytelling is backwards you know that sean is disfigured and needs medical care but you don't know exactly what happened until the last few pages of the book usually this drives me nuts but because the book is so short and so well written i could ignore it some reviewers wrote that they wished the book was longer but i disagree sometimes less is more especially with a protagonist who you're not so sure if you want to be sympathetic with for the record i'm still not sure","954":"a prosey book rather than a gripping story that's fine because i like good prose as much as a good plot and the prose is very good no plot to speak of wiwv details the internal life of suicide survivor and game writer sean still a very very good read in some ways it's difficult to critique prose work because you make it sound boring this book is not boring unless you don't like prose or unless it doesn't matter to you my partner who is not a prose reader did not like it","955":"the most thematically consistent book i've read in a long while a little anticlimactic though i enjoyed the first part considerably more than the second","956":"strange read hard to get into at first i wonder if the character was borderline autistic or something in his lack of connection to others his game was like a choose your own adventure story book without end because of other's fear he was not allowed to attend his grandmother's funeral even though she was an important person in sean's life i'm still not sure if it was an accident or a suicide attempt that scarred sean even the author is unclear in his writing about it","957":"originally reviewed at elphareads tumblr com 4 5 starsa few weeks ago i discovered a book podcast called 'literary disco' i was sucked into it because one of the main contributors is rider strong aka shawn hunter on boy meets world i mean hey there is no way i was going to say no to that as i made my way through some of the episodes all of which have a book that the three hosts read and then discuss i came upon the episode wolf in white van by john darnielle i had heard of this book before as my friend eloisefleur had read it and as it won and alex award and i'm very much on top of those but i hadn't really considered picking it up but then 'literary disco' was going on and on about it and i decided that maybe i should pick it up and give it a try after all it's about a guy who designs and implements a mail in text based rpg and wow does that sound great this book however is so much more than that sean phillips is the creator of a massive and complex text based role playing game called trace italian what started as a way to keep himself busy and as a way to connect to the world after a life changing disfigurement on his face trace italian is now a world that sean can lose himself in as he guides other players throughout the many twists and turns of the game though sean tries to forget the injury that left him permanently scarred sean is constantly reminded just by looking in the mirror so interacting with the 'normal' world with a fantasy one seems fairly ideal but it turns out that some people may take trace italian a little too seriously and when two teenagers try to play the game for real resulting in the death of one of them sean is called to take responsibility by the dead girl's parents both a journey through isolation and a journey to what caused sean's disfigurement wolf in white van so perfectly captures isolation and desperation in so many different forms that i was totally blown away by it i thought that i was going to get a thrilling drama about a court case spurred on by the days of 'judas priest killed my son ' but what i got instead was a very in depth and sad character study about a man who has cut himself off from the world and has tried to escape into another one because of it darnielle writes beautiful prose and complex characters and sean was definitely a tragic and also maddening protagonist the description of this mail in rpg also made me want to play it like whoa and it really spoke to the nerd inside of me who enjoys finding a fantasy world to sink into just for a little while while it sometimes found the time jumping confusing overall i thought that this story was complex enough to be wholly original and sad while still keeping my attention and keeping me on track there were certain scenes that just played out so beautifully and the journey that sean takes in this book is a journey that i never knew i wanted to take with him and yet had a hard time leaving behind when other duties called and while it is a shorter book than others i've read as of late i found myself taking my time and wanting to savor it as much as possible i would say that i want more answers for some of the plot points but ultimately it isn't about the answers or perhaps more correctly there are no answers and sometimes that's life i really appreciated that sentiment i just really liked wolf in white van guys rich in symbolism and pathos i feel like this was a wonderful book to end the summer with if you read it steady your heart and try not to wax poetic about the days of dungeons and dragons in friends basements","958":"one word comes to mind astounding","959":"an excellent debut by someone from whom i'd expect no less darnielle perfectly captures the terrifying and intense nature of choices we make through the relatable perspective of adolescence and the unique viewpoint of a disfigured man he also really nails what it's like to be a nerdy borderline or maybe wholly obsessive kid totally engrossed in their interests i loved this","960":"i'm honestly not sure if i got it full review wolf in white van book review","961":"i feel very sad right now but in a good way","962":"i read this after hearing about it on a podcast and i'm glad i did sean a video game developer reflects on his life before and after an incident that leaves his face disfigured i don't want to reveal much else about the plot but the writing is beautiful and sad this is a quick and engrossing read that i think will stick with me for a while if your looking for something different and profound give it a try","963":"i wanted to like this more than i did but meh","964":" 3 5 5 starsi'm torn on this one i really liked its quirky attributes but i can't say that i enjoyed it in the same way i would enjoy most stories because it isn't most stories i had a hard time connecting with any of the characters i didn't feel like there was much insight into their emotions or the reasoning behind their actions at first the dense and slightly jarring writing style caught me off guard but once i got used to it i was able to appreciate the strength in john darnielle's cerebral language at the outset the world building was minimal but as the story progresses we're exposed more and more to the bizarre and enthralling world inside the protagonist's mind oftentimes delving into the fictional wasteland of the trace italian the premise of this mail in decision making strategy game was incredibly unique there wasn't much in the way of plot but i think that was the point the structure and timeline of the story were definitely odd in a good way it skipped back and forth overall moving backward in time toward a pivotal moment in the protagonist's life it was interesting to explore the effect one action has causing a ricochet of change on not just one life but on all others it catches this is not a light read by any means but if you're looking for a story that will make you think you might want to pick this one up","965":" i was expecting sean to be an intentionally unlikeabale character and was surprised to find myself liking him quite a bit i found so much of myself and different people i've known in him and yet he was still strange and and out there seeing the world through his eyes was really interesting the way in which we take a tour through seans memories twisting and turning continually like some one trying to find his way through the trace italian is captivating but unlike the trace when we reach the center we don't find a sanctuary but something very different","966":" john darnielle under the moniker mountain goats both alone and with other members has gained a substantial following of very devoted fans a lot of readers are likely approaching his book with a set of expectations already in hand and most reviews bear this out while familiar with his musical output i've never really cared for it it always struck me as forgetable inoffensive indie rock not terrible to listen but not all that memorable either the main point is that i'm approaching his book as i'd approach pretty much any other book by an author i haven't yet read wolf in white van is a tremendously accomplished first novel the writing is top notch the plot is compelling and the reader is left thinking about the book long after it has been put down darnielle uses sean's experiences both with his own personal tragedy and the tragedy of a pair of kids who played his game to explore important issues anyone who was a bit of an outcast in high school can easily relate to sean's immersion in heavy metal and fantasy books sean's loneliness and connection to others only through the mechanism of the game in many ways mirrors the loneliness of our technology dependent age darnielle also raises the issue of artistic responsibility is the creator responsible for what someone else does as a result of his work and the final big question of the book is why does anyone do the things they do is there always an explanation or purpose for actions i would have given the book 5 stars if not for the about the author section on the back dust jacket in which john darnielle is described as the greatest lyricist of his generation","967":"disfigured man haunted by the ghost of robert e howard calls the shots mostly in a role playing game of his invention administered analog thru the us postal system it's how he makes a living it's what he does poetic strange tragic and hopeful dare i say lyrical no too on the nose also don't think i've seen too many sean protagonists maybe that's why i liked it so much i'm gonna write a book about a boy named john","968":"too much telling not enough showing despite the main character's well developed voice this was a slog for me","969":"incredible incredible incredible book i don't even have words for how much i love and would recommend this book like john's music you'll love his writing","970":"i picked this up because the premise sounded original and fresh i did enjoy reading it the story is told in reverse and the prose is lovely and sometimes gut wrenching that said i do wish there was more of a plot than just the narrator's inner ramblings not much action more details regarding the court hearing lance and carrie just to name a few","971":"this is a short sharp and kind of odd read that deals with the stories we tell ourselves and the choices we make on a more superficial level it deals with isolation alienation pain family all the things that inform the choices we make and the stories we tell ourselves the narrator tells the story roughly speaking backwards to the beginning and i am sure many critics reviewers have pointed out that the authour uses the same literary technique that the title references that of satanic messages being encrypted in records and only accessed by playing the recording backward reminds me of something i heard once life is only understood backwards but must be lived forwards or something like that roughly speaking the narrator tells his story backwards but in reading it i found it difficult to pinpoint a timeline it felt all over the map but that's fine it felt much the way my own brain works i might have a memory of my mother from childhood think of something i saw in toronto last weekend think of something a coworker said yesterday then wonder about what i will have for lunch in a couple of hours and all of this within the space of a minute or less wolf in white van is the story the narrator is telling himself what i am unclear about is whether or not he knows it there is a wonderful passage set in the hospital when sean realizes his parents have together created a story about what happened to him that makes sense to them this is a really interesting read but i am glad the author kept it short as there isn't really a whole lot of story","972":"written by mountain goats' frontman john darnielle wolf in white van is an excellent transcription of postmodern ideals into a context rooted in the arcade machines and conan stories of the past the book deals with loss suicide and mental instability through the lens of roleplay and narrative a good book for anyone seeking depth and amoral literature","973":"had high expectations of this book which makes me want to give it two stars but i think it deserves three it feels like someone's reminiscence of their childhood but not in a way that i can relate to although i like the story line i felt like the main character didn't really have any depth nothing happened in the book despite it's dramatic story line and overall i was left disappointed there was no growth","974":" i'd just like to open this by saying that i genuinely believe that this is the best book i've ever read however it must be said that the beauty of darnielle's work is not in its plot this is a non linear book written in gramatically beautiful sentences darnielle dances upon the thin line between prose and lyrical verse awing us with an intimate knowledge of language reminiscent of that displayed in his albums with the mountain goats it seems that a lot of the negative reviews here come from those who read this as a story about an rpg game run through the mail these people could hardly be farther from the truth this is a book about intellectual disconnection re finding oneself in the wake of losing one's physical identity and the horror of watching helplessly as one's actions destroy the worlds of those around them don't just read this book go back to your high school days and grab a hilighter annotate this thing write notes in the margins as if they were the last scraps of paper on earth analyze share discuss let the book change you","975":" wolf in white van is relaxing and horrifying after accidentally leading two teenagers to their death with his pen and paper rpg a horribly disfigured middle aged man named sean re lives his own imaginative teen years and the events leading up to his disfigurement the writing is beautiful flowing and every section has a thought provoking ending but the book is a bit too unbelievable for me there's no way sean could find any success in a snail mail based rpg especially in 2003 when the main events take place also sean didn't seem nearly depressed or damaged enough to spoilers attempt suicide i enjoyed it but i will probably never read it a second time","976":"i am a bit biased because this book depicts some of the mundanitites of inland empire southern california so well and that is really worth a lot to me this is a sad book and i don't think i'd give it to anyone as a gift but if i hadn't checked it out from the library i'd definitely want to lend it to few people who would all probably want to give it back to me it has a sickening quality a bit like tom mccarthy's remainder but the setting and the youthful narrator make it less surreal i can't wait to read another john darnielle book and if you like his music and lyrics you will probably like this too","977":" thank you to the publisher for sending me this book in exchange for an honest review this did not alter my review in any way wow this book has just - surprised me i just - wow i've been reading so many good books and giving out such favourable reviews lately you guys are going to think i'm getting soft but this one it is really good it is also very different it wasn't what i thought it was going to be instead it was something much better something intriguing suspenseful and unlike anything else i have ever read and it just left me wondering trying to turn over such an unfathomable thing in my mind at the age of seventeen sean suffers a lifechanging and disfiguring injury that isolates him from the rest of the world in hospital he began to write and create a whole new imaginary world a text based game where players subscribe and receive their turns by mail the world exists only in his - and their - minds the game takes place in a futuristic america that has been ravaged by radioactive poisoning where players are seeking a safe location called trace italian when two high school students take the game out into the real world a tragedy occurs and sean is called to account for it through the novel the readers are taken backwards in time through the progression and creation of the game through sean's time in hospital back to that moment that ultimately decided sean's future i read this in a day and a half it's not long but it was difficult to get into at first until i became accustomed to darnielle's writing style there is no clear beginning and end to this story we are dropped into a memory knowing that something terrible has happened to sean but not really sure what just yet that is revealed over time the slow reveal can be excruciating to a demanding reader like myself but i remained patient i wandered through sean's memories his stories his game i tried to understand him and my first reaction was to sympathise with him but my feelings changed along the course of the novel while still trying to understand i can imagine how his parents were so frustrated because like me they lacked understanding they wanted answers to a question they probably weren't going to get but i still couldn't believe some of the things they said the construction of this novel is irregular and unconventional but it all still makes sense and it suits the story we work backwards but its not always linear there was every opportunity to be confused but somehow it all made sense the two high school students lance and carrie who take their play of sean's game out of the imaginative realm and into the real world are interesting catalysts for sean's backward train of thought but this was never about them it is where the lines between fantasy and reality blur for sean but the game was never the problem the game seems to have been his salvation and it's not what has happened that's surprising or shocking because we know from the start it was something bad it's more the intricate details of it all the things we don't often think about it's also very hard to talk about without spoilers the nature of this book and its heavy content means it won't be for everyone however there is a lot to be found here there were times when i would reread paragraphs or whole pages even once i'd finished trying to wrap my head around the situation trying - and failing - to imagine what life was and is like for sean it's difficult to process it's not easy to stump me this novel has done exactly that i'm still sitting here wondering i got sucked into it and then it spat me out at the end and i am still wondering it is nothing short of brilliant i just wish there was more to the answer but maybe i am looking for something that does not exist","978":"3 5 stars this book left me wanting a little more i thought the storyline was interesting and i enjoyed the point of view darnielle's writing is elegant and i wanted more of it to get a better understanding of sean lance and carrie i guess the point is that sean did not have a total grasp of his players","979":"i really enjoyed this book it had a certain dreamlike quality to it as it weaved together the mental worlds that the main character had created for himself and others","980":"i wanted to like this more the underlying concept of the trace italian fascinated me and there were moments of brilliance in tying the concept of choice and paths unexplored but the ending left me unsatisfied","981":"fine first novel by the man behind the mountain goats a troubled young man survives a personal tragedy by immersing himself in a fantasy game he created but even his seclusion can't prevent him from impacting others both for better and worse","982":"well i was pretty into this until the last couple of chapters and then it completely lost me fun overall and trace italian is a cool idea","983":"a really interesting short novel written in the voice of a young man who has had a lot happen to him in his life what exactly you won't really understand until the end if then","984":"this is a brilliantly written book i will definitely read the next book that darnielle writes i listened to the audiobook and the performance was quite good as well","985":"nothing really happens in this book but if you are the right type of person you will keep going i don't know if you'll be satisfied it definitely affected me i like to imagine this is a book about the infinity of choices an adolescent mind can see and maybe the hardening narrowing blood vessels of possibility as we age there's an evolutionary reason for this otoh it did make me listen to the mountain goats for a couple hours","986":" wolf in white van gets teenagers in a way that is both refreshing and horrifying a psychological novel that brings the reader into the feelings that lead to and stem from violence when we meet sean he seems like a guy who is coping well with a facial deformity just back from winning a judgment in a trial connected to a play by mail game he runs called trace italian the game seems like an innocuous thing travel through a post apocalyptic midwest find a fort in the middle of kansas burrow down through the layers to find safety in humanity or what's left of it but the game leads to a terrible tragedy one person dead another scarred for life of which sean is acquitted but still feels remorse the other notable player the reader learns immolated his character within the game before it was too late as the plot unwinds we draw closer and closer to the truth behind sean's disfigurement what drove the violence that left him forever despoiled was it fantasy was it love was it rock music was it role playing dungeons u0026amp dragons style game was it satan was it a wolf in a white van these questions aren't answered in the book the ending is a quick bloody rush which left me re reading the final chapters twice to view the clues darnielle had placed for me frankly the whole book deserves a re read","987":"i'm still digesting the book it had a lot of time jumps which were a bit confusing and an unreliable narrator a person who was both determined to be honest in all things and unsure of what he thought and felt i read it in a single day and couldn't put it down","988":"i really liked reading this book and dhalgren at the same time","989":"it's too easy to go down the artistic book review path and it makes sense because wolf in white van's narration uses a lot of unusual similes and fragmented sentences and people often pick up a book's voice in their head after reading it i do it all the time after reading trainspotting i couldn't help but think in scots besides the writing style which smacks of darnielle there doesn't seem to be much to the story when you first begin it it's about this bloke who's got a deformed face and it bothers him that people try not to stare the blurb makes it sound like some bullshit hunger games kind of story then you get to the end find out why what happened then this and what everyone thinks and it unfolds like a number of mountain goats songs that are concertinaed together except written from a new perspective what did i say about writing styles rubbing off on people it's worth a try but it's not everything i've ever dreamt of i know some people who would like just because of who wrote it i think ultimately it's marketed as a young adult novel and a few people on goodreads have even listed it as one but i wouldn't insult anyone like that are you going to be the one to call john darnielle a more highly skilled john green","990":"definitely not what i expected captivating splendidly written read it in a single sitting","991":"audible read by the author is it about the devil is it a quest why did the narrator try to kill himself i started this short 5 hour listen about 6 times and didn't settle in until i was 2 hours into the book narrator provides interesting account of the game he developed before the online video game became popular trace italian which he manages via letter with the game's subscribers the lance and carey subplot is the most affecting of his stories the book ends abruptly","992":"a brilliant book ruined by a weak unsatisfying ending honestly i hate a weak ending to a good story far more than i hate a mediocre story","993":"along with his 33 1 3 book not to mention his music this novel proves darnielle's unique sensitivity to the confusion joys pain uncomprehension and hope of teenagers this book is so narratively compact and precise that it heightens sean's bleak existence as well as the slivers of grace that sneak past the darkness it's emotional depths will stay with me for some time","994":"this book has lingered on my shelf for a while because i suspected that the acclaim it received was mostly due to the fact that the author is a well loved indie singer songwriter and i don't like his music so i put it off that was a mistake the book definitely deserves the acclaim it reads a bit like a mystery where we have a pretty good idea of who done it but we don't know why the narrator sean was disfigured in an accident in high school and now operates a mail based i e hard core choose your own adventure game unfortunately two of the kids playing his game were hurt we get glimpses of sean's and the kids' stories as sean tells us about what happened but we're left with a lot of uncertainty this uncertainty is frustrating but feels appropriate for the story and leaves a lot to talk about like the incident why aren't we using the other more accurate word here what really led up to that incident even the choice of the title raises several questions ultimately the book is about escapism and it explores its capacity for refuge and disaster","995":"based on the good things i'd heard this was a disappointment an interesting look at the narrator's mind but hard for me to get into","996":"it still irritates that little place in me that wants everything answered and tied up with a nice little bow but it was an amazing book","997":" of recent memory this is the only book that's leapt at me as an instantly important piece of modern literature darnielle poignantly describes beauty beneath the grotesque with perfect prose painting a first person portrait of not just a broken body but of a broken spirit it's a rarity when i'm speechless after reading and when i finished this one i gently folded the cover feeling the spine creak between my hands and sat reflecting on its grimness its honesty its poise i cannot recommend this book strongly enough","998":"i wasn't blown away by wolf in white van although it was good the writing was decent despite veering off into some overblown description on occasion and the character of sean was quite well done we never really leave his head and his interactions with others are pretty minimal so it's hard to say darnielle writes characters plural well but as a stand alone sean works really i just wished for less of the stream of consciousness and more of the story itself stream of consciousness can really work for me given the right setting but this wasn't it it was much too short for one thing and what was there felt a little flimsy anyway there just wasn't much to hold on to overall","999":"i wish i knew why i also would like to read trace italian i think actually playing it would stress me out","1000":" i was puzzled after finishing wolf in white van profound and or life changing reading experience nah not over here so many reviewers seems to see something utterly amazing in this book where i found it to be just okay did i miss something the story of a game designer is told backwards towards the event that caused the main characters face disfigurement and that concept is appealing yet this structure created a build up that the end of the book didn't live up to imho i figured the what out fairly early and the why was not all that earth shattering to me either plus it was a kind expected why after spending so much time in the mc's head i thought we would learn something new i thought there would be more to this story than teen angst and thoughts on isolation imagination and injuries the themes are valid and can be very satisfying to read about but here i received the thoughts but found them rather unfulfilled for me the book didn't do much and the more i progressed the more i had to force myself to pick it up again it is short and the composition pretty much screams for being read fast maybe even in one sitting but i felt slightly bored and didn't like to spend much time with these pages considering the praise and love people have for this book it is likely me and not the text it didn't click with me that i know it is a neat story written in a neat way the things i found interesting are not explored enough for me though like the guilt and responsibility question that arises when 2 gamers take take sean's game too serious on other topics it dwells too long sure some chapters i quite liked how they were written and what they provoked but it was too little and too short i guess it's all matter of taste and this one didn't quite hit mine maybe i should have read ready player one instead apparently i don't like my 80's gamer stories too introspected and introspected on only vaguely enriching things","1001":"this would pair nicely with the third reich for your facially disfigured loners and the games they play book club","1002":" i am a little conflicted here cuz i wanted to love this novel but it was more kinda meh and i was worse off from the start because it was recommended as a book about a guy who _______________ where really the beauty of the work is in its unfolding of what it's about leaving the beginning for the end unfortunately i also felt like the author was finally get a head of steam in the last 12 pages now gotta go listen to more mountain goats and get the 33 1 3 book on master of reality because you gotta support this artist that's all","1003":" it took me three tries to start this book because i kept getting bored at the beginning but as soon as i pressed through and entered the story it hooked me immediately if you are considering the whether it will be worthwhile to push though the first couple of chapters i highly suggest it this book felt similar to the process of meeting a new person and each chapter felt like the next conversation that you might have with them getting deeper and more personal as you enter their past the definitive phrases he used always left me gratified such as simple math and its consequences or there is something fierce and starved about first ideas","1004":"i really wanted to and probably should have liked this book a lot more than i did there are beautiful moments throughout i appreciated its quiet presentation of isolation and loneliness the premise of the mail in role playing game trace italian seems like such a promising idea and the reveal of the accident was tantalizing that being said something about the book just didn't let me in and i found myself not feeling in any way connected to the character or story honestly part of it may have been the non linear structure of which i was not a fan anyway this is a long and rambling way of saying a little great at times but overall just okay whomp whomp","1005":"the dungeons u0026amp dragons mystery we've been waiting for","1006":" ugh i have not been picking well i was intrigued early on but the farther i got in the more that intrigue waned i kept wanting to get into the protagonists head but didn't feel like i could ever get there most descriptions of events in his life were simply descriptions they reminded me of stories told by a young child that are flat and have no emotion in them when you are done listening you either wonder why or what was the point of telling me that at one point when he was rattling off states and cities i actually screamed out ok i get your point i think this had potential but fell quite short","1007":"wow i don't know what to say about this book the plot is simple a boy is in an accident and invents a game as he heals but it's a tough book it's about just that sentence and yet it's also about life and death and how who we are changes from minute to minute did i enjoy it not really will it stay with me yes for a long time","1008":"my daughter was assigned this book as part of her high school summer reading requirements she said the book was confusing and hard to understand so i thought i would give it a try i found the lack of any type of chronological order to be difficult to follow also the shift from reality to his fantasy game world lacked appeal for teenage girls","1009":"i've been a mountain goats fan since high school this book has the same personal evocative qualities as darnielle's lyrics i still struggle with books that don't offer up concrete conclusions but this novel hit upon emotional truth in a gratifying way","1010":"well that was truly strange i'm not entirely sure i understood it at all it was good at times but it was also seemingly transparently bad at others the voice of the character was superb u0026amp the in world description was incredible i'd love to play trace italian if it wasn't made by this guy it's probably worth a reread but i'm not sure i'll ever get to that regardless super glad i read it u0026amp would like to talk to people who loved it","1011":"3 5 is my preference strange but compelling nothing really happens but it's impactful in its quietness nothing is explained fully but it makes you think","1012":"i know it's an unpopular opinion but i prefer my books with some plot in them","1013":"i read this over the holidays and was really pretty underwhelmed i know it got a lot of great reviews and made it onto a lot of best of shortlists but i don't get it a lot of folks really raved about the writing but i found it sort of overwrought and man if ever there was an author who overused and abused the semicolon here is one it was out of control and 9 times out of 10 inappropriate i liked bits of it the image of the narrator watching the tv late into the night the visceral quality of a lingering scent and the occasional stunner of line like this one pain woke me up several times a night as it would continue to do for over a year and occasionally forever and i taught myself to power through it on the way back to sleep because getting medication in the middle of the night was too sad and horrible to be worth it that's some beautiful original writing but it also points to the incredible sadness and really gruesomeness of the text it's just kind of relentlessly awful and i never felt like i quite understood why","1014":"this was confusing i'd definitly need to reread this one to fully appreciate it very well told and creative way to tell the story in reverse but idk mahbe i was missing something","1015":"an incredibly moving brilliant book i'm still lost inside it","1016":"i wanted to like it a lot more than i did it was a pretty acceptable white guy literary novel but i'm such a fan of his music i hoped the book would be more","1017":"if i didn't have to read this for work i would not have done so","1018":"couldn't put it down had to find out why sean committed the horror what trace italian the game he invented had to do with what put him into the miserable life he now endured his parents how did they feed into what he did a must read","1019":"this is a slow burning book a book you can't fully appreciate or understand until it's over it took me at least a week after finishing to really appreciate and make peace with it a story of a lonely guy who himself is ok with being alone he is ok with the decisions he made but the people in his life can't and won't understand he doesn't have solid reasons why or reasons that would make sense to anyone they just happen and that's really all it's perfectly fitting to the meaning of title of the book explained in the book there are so many underlying issues and meanings the book is well written as expected but this is not a book for everyone this is not a fast paced exciting story with twists and turns it's a soft story dealing with hard issues i feel the book comes back to haunt your thoughts often it's a book that once you put down will constantly remain with you","1020":"seems like everything i read this past week has left me with mixed feelings i am giving this a 3 which is more of a 3 5 which may potentially be a 4 i can't do math but you don't do math with feelings there were many moments when this book confused me the world outside sean's mind the world inside the game the world before the accident the world right after the world after the players disappeared but i feel that it was intentional it meant to be disorientating as memories often are and the world itself real or not i found the game aspects of the novel not really compelling but there weren't that many parts and chapters about it anyway i thought it would be more centered around that but in a way i am glad it wasn't since i didn't really care about them as a meditation on trauma memory life the roads not taken escapism it was very well done and hit all the right notes for me i guess this could have been more about the reasons that lead to sean's decision or maybe they could have been less vague but i accept his i don't know why i did it it just happened ok because i still connected to the character and also sometimes things do just happen so my mind says 3 my gut says 4 i don't know what my memory of it will say later","1021":" 5 i sat for 20 minutes after finishing the novel staring out at the east river and thinking the complexity at work here made me want to start it up again but i didn't want to ruin the moment as it were it's the sort of book that both demands a second go and insists that you leave it alone it is frustrating in some ways it is beautiful in all the ways and what seems at first like something altogether simple becomes quite quickly so much more than that it is a gift really this novel allows you for a brief moment to truly escape from the confines of your life and look down on it as some sort of omnipotent outsider might a kind of transcendence i can't wait for all of you to read it more at rb http ragingbiblioholism com 2014 06","1022":" you should avoid seeing too much of yourself anywhere in the outside world in others in the imagined worlds that give you shelter it's hard to know what to say about a book that needs to be read before we can have a conversation about it john darnielle's first novel is small but dense with rich layers relating to creation and creators and their audiences there is something fierce and starved about first ideas i read it just well enough the first time to realize that i'll need to return in order to appreciate fully what he's done our glimpses into sean's world are fleeting selective funny and full of grief he felt very real to me very quickly flawed but not quite fatally -- the sort of flaws we must continue to live with i empathize for the people around him but it doesn't make me like him any less nor does liking him help me to understand him but really how much -- how deeply -- do we understand one another anyway who knows the secrets of anybody's heart i guess for all i know everyone involved with krull has bodies under the floorboards and babies in the oven darnielle's fictional non musical debut is remarkable and i hope you will read it so that i can say more there is so much more to say also i kinda want to watch krull now","1023":"john darnielle presents a cut to the bone narrative about self determined tragedy and the courses that such choices make not only in the lives of the victim but in those around them our narrator sean phillips created trace italian in his hospital room after surviving a suicide attempt that left him with horrific disfigurement through the course of the game the players make decisions that reflect his own and a line of demarcation dissolves between imagination and reality not in a surreal or narrative way but a philosophical way darnielle captures the wandering passions of youth and the deeply burrowed sorrow that lays dormant in just about every kid but also gives you a map on how to get out if you look hard enough tgere's no way to die really there are always more moves you are in charge","1024":" the title of this one relates to the old stories about what you might hear if you play certain albums backwards which is a nod to how the novel unfolds we start in the present day and gradually work backwards to the real beginning of sean's story i'm a sucker for almost any attempt to play with time or pov and the story certainly unfolds or backtracks or whatever in a way that will keep you hooked ultimately though even after a pretty emotionally brutal final scene it just felt like the novel never really found a way to tie all its very interesting threads into something that would make it anything more than just a pretty good read but you know pretty good is still pretty good","1025":"this book was so weird at first and then i understood everything and got into it i loved the parts where he sends his little game moves out to the customers and has little token coins made for them","1026":" echoes of j d salinger david foster wallace bret easton ellis and early stephen king i'll be rereading this one there are puzzles here which may not be solvable just how unreliable a narrator is sean what's locked in his desk drawer what thought won't he share about lance what's the deal with kimmy coming into his life again and what does their time together have to do with how things ultimately turn out maybe the answer is that there are no answers kids sometimes do boneheaded or even horrific things for no reason that they can articulate sean's story is haunting and sad and desparate and circles around something terribly important without ever quite spelling it out","1027":"the next time i spend 200 pages inside the mind of a character i can only hope that the character isn't as boring as sean","1028":"john darnielle is probably one of the finest songwriters out there second only to elvis costello at least in my world that is as the driving force behind mountain goats darnielle has penned a gigantic catalog of songs most of them fairly bleak that are top loaded with stark evocative imagery often about people going through some really bad times songwriter to novelist isn't always a natural progression but in this instance darnielle's novel 'wolf in white van' plays out like a long form extension of his songwriting the prose reads like his lyrics at times and in its 207 pages there's an abundance of loneliness death tragedy beauty and humor darnielle brings us into the world of a young man struggling to survive a life forever marred by a terrible mistake and the first person narrative attempts to bring the various pieces together not necessarily the feel good book of the year but still highly recommended","1029":"i really enjoyed it as a person who played an off game when i was in high school this brought back some of those memories it was also interesting to hear his entire story","1030":"apparently one either loves this book or simply doesn't get it i'm the latter","1031":"couldn't finish this book shame","1032":" there are lots of things to like about this i love sean the main character what he does for a living his past his thoughtfulness and kindness and courage however i found the structure and pacing of this book to be seriously wonky the interesting things are told in asides and flashbacks separated by long paragraphs about sean's current day thoughts and feelings maybe a more straightforward narrative structure would have served it better as it is the book is slow and unevenly paced there's enough promise here to check out darnielle's second novel if we ever get one","1033":"i loved this the character was very real to me the prose was descriptive without being too heavy or show offy and the elliptical structure of the story was for me satisfying 5 stars for john darnielle whose music i'm only tepid on lest you think i'm a starry eyed superfan or something","1034":"this review was originally posted here on my blog magic u0026amp musings john darnielle's wolf in white van was a very new experience for me but one i am now craving in other books i cannot compare it to anything i've read before wolf in white van is told in non chronological order from the viewpoint of sean a man living in seclusion since a disfiguring accident when he was a teenager over the course of the story we slowly get given pieces of what happened to him but we also are given another story alongside of what's happened since in his attempt to find something to do he creates a play by post game called trace italian players find adverts for his game in magazines and comics send off for instructions and begin the game sending in their moves to sean who then responds with their progress in the game as a lover of turn based games and rpgs this was the most engaging part of the story for me as well as the frequent references to conan comics fanzines and sci fi two teenagers become deeply involved in the game and eventually tragedy strikes sean is brought to justice for his actions if it was really his fault at all now this is an odd book as i said before i haven't quite read anything like this the structure is convoluted as you're thrust between sean's life pre injury and his life post trace italian many sections of the book include long passages from trace italian itself depicting a future america where savages roam the street and resources are scarce it only occurred to me after reading that the seclusion in this wilderness is probably supposed to be symbolic of sean's seclusion in his home along with troubled relationships with his parents and weird experiences as he ventures outside and encounters members of the public i don't have a great deal to say about wolf in white van other than the fact i loved it and i want to spread the word about it it was a unique tale told in a fun way it made me yearn for a game like trace italian even though i'm not sure if i would have the patience for it these days sean is an interesting and troubled character to read from and i'm really looking forward to what darnielle brings out next my one criticism would be that i wanted more from the perspective of the teenagers who get in too deep with the game in the real world i feel like they could have had an interesting perspective one that is sorely missed wolf in white van was published in june 2014 by farrar straus and giroux the hypnotising cover art is by timothy goodman","1035":"it's an interesting short read well written definitely written by someone around my age given the references the chronology works and adds some mystery to the inevitable it's very much about being in someone's head someone who spends a lot of time in their own head a disturbed head i'll have to think about this one for a bit that seems to be a common theme for those who read it","1036":"i really liked this until the end then i just felt gypped i think perhaps i'm just too old to appreciate it","1037":"as a huge fan of his lyrics i was worried about what a novel from john darnielle would be like given a larger medium i was unsure how his particular gift to voicing character and slinging story would translate there are clusters of prose that will prick up a mountain goats fan's ears but in no distracting way wolf in white van is a beautiful meditation of a novel never loud never hurried","1038":" well i finished it no one can say i'm a quitter i am starting to get really bummed out because half of the books i have read this summer have been incredibly disappointing this book is just weird i have read other reviews that talk about how some people just don't get it i can definitely be added to that group of dull witted non savvy readers it reads like a stream of consciousness acid trip there is no plot there are no endearing lovable characters no insult to the author who might be a lovely human being but this book is simply awful","1039":"i could see him starting to think hard during the little minute of quiet that followed wheels turning i wondered if maybe something difficult was opening itself up to him that maybe people do things for no reason that things just happen that nobody really knows much that's the whole thing tho","1040":"this book is accomplished it is well written it's structure enhances the story despite the candor of the narrator not everything is revealed some things are left to be guessed at which is how i imagine a conversation with sean the narrator would actually progress the reader knows something has happened in sean's past due to his obvious disfigurement the past was violent but the reasons for that violence aren't clear and probably can't be clarified through explanation so we all have to go through the hard work of getting to know each other without understanding what has brought us to where we are when i write about it i love it i love the ideas that i get from reading the book but i can't say that i loved the book but i respect it it is worth reading closely it is worth reading again","1041":"i wish that novels came with a warning label or rather an indicator of the level of seriousness the reader should expect i say this because just reading the summary of wolf led me to believe this novel would be about an outcast who found solace in the things that outcasts usually do gaming music etc and those themes are present and important here but this book this book rare is the book that makes me want to immediately re read it i say that because i feel like i glossed over the first half not giving it the respect it deserved it wasn't until i read the following that i realized what the author was really getting at to set the scene sean's mother is worried about him entering a care home as he is finally able to leave the hospital saying i worry that you'll be lonely sean replies \"i was going to be lonely anyway \" i don't want to spoil the plot of the novel but for sean to say that almost brushing off what happened to him was a very powerful moment for me from the outside we expect the disfigurement to be the horrible part but to sean he was already disfigured he already felt like he was an outsider what would it matter if he did what he did he'd never fit in anyways and the question of why i know i want the world to make sense for actions to have causes for emotions to have causes sean's parents certianly did but what if things don't have to be the result of anything what if i don't know really is the answer to why we are who we are that emily never asked sean why was also a very powerful moment in the novel to me this is the type of book you'd want your best friends to read to then discuss with people you trust people you can have serious conversations with","1042":"great book one of the best i've read in awhile highly recommended","1043":" interesting structure to the book often making me feel off balance and this was not completely without it's own pleasure the final scene where you are given the supposed to answers to how sean injured himself were unsatisfying in that it was probably to true to life that means it was basically from the pov of the frontal lobes of an adolescent male a place that lacks much foresight judgement or compassion and can be tedious to fathom unfortunately the sean the protagonist doesn't really seam to have learned much in life but only creates an on going reenactment of choices that other adolescents have to make in order to play his game through of course no one ever gets to thrace since no one in life ever gets to a secure shelter in adolescence or adult life luckily book is short and a quick read","1044":"i'll say what everyone is saying this book is beautiful written it's lyrical and poetic i found it lovely to read i don't think this one will appeal to everyone despite the beautiful writing it is not a charming book the layers of wolf in white van are subtle and i completely understand why folks don't like it i was ready to give this one a 2 or 3 star review when i read the final chapter it didn't end with any sort of revelation with all the subplots tied up in a nice package i'll admit it reading a nicely summed up story is nice it's comfortable this book did not go where i expected it to go in the end i was left wondering why is this book so great why the rave reviews what am i missing i reflected on the story quite a bit and i think that is where one finds the book's power and what makes it spectacular i didn't find the connections between the subplots to be obvious while reading through it but looking back i keep thinking wow if i didn't have to take it back to the library i'd be giving it another read i'm curious how the connectedness would shine through upon a reread here's what i've come up with this book is about feeling helpless in a world where one is powerless no matter the decisions sean makes he is on a path he can't get off of exactly like the game he has invented there's only one thing sean and chris in the game world can do that gives him power that gives him control best case scenario sean is incredibly gifted with a vivid expansive imagination worst case scenario he is a schizophrenic teen getting lost in the noise around him either way he is completely wasted on his parents who are unable unwilling to make any connection with him sean claims there is no cause that led up to his accident there wasn't any reason why he was the way he was looking between the scenes one finds 13 000 reasons why he has a mother who never says exactly what she means a father who has to rehearse anything important he has to say he's never in the moment the parents and son can't have a simple conversation without teetering on the edge of an argument after the accident all sean's parents are concerned with is finding someone to blame even if it means further isolating their son apparently they never consider taking a moment of inner reflection i'm still reflecting on the theme of god in this novel sean grapples with the existence of god and in a way is a god himself in the world of trace italian an uncaring god when real people are hurt because of trace italian how can he be held responsible i really enjoyed this book even more i enjoyed stewing it in my mind after reading it the book was subtle and simple the more i think about it the more i like it something that irked me while reading was the difficulty and awkwardness of the text leaping through memory game world and present time it wasn't always obvious and was sometimes annoying the tense was sometimes off in memories but i think it may have been an issue with copy there were so many typos how can a book go to print in such a state","1045":"i found this book by accident on youtube and i decided to audiobook it to fall asleep it did a good job though that doesn't really say anything about the quality of the story i just fall asleep more easily with someone reading me a story i have mixed feelings about this book i really liked the beginning it sounded so interesting but then it just didn't happen it feels as if the author ignored so many opportunities to make this into an amazing novel and at the end it just made me feel cheated now first off being a child of the internet era though having known a pre internet time vaguely it was really weird but in a fun way to read about a guy who makes rpg mails by sending letters to his players i wish i could have seen that happen but alas we have things like elder scrolls and gta nowadays and soooo many others i really liked how he switched between the game world and the actual world now the story itself was very promising with 2 mysteries that needed explaining first of all the main characters weird accident which left him disabled and the death of two teenagers that played the game even though this both gets explained the explanation isn't really satisfying the teenagers' deaths aren't really explained thoroughly well i just felt like it needed a bit more time to go into it and explain it better especially because society now still hasn't decided on whether videogames are evil or not do they lead to violence in real life or don't they etc his own accident needed more explanation as well for me i'm still left wondering about the main characters motivation to make him do what he did without spoiling it for anyone still i could have easily overlooked these problems and give it a higher rating if not for the bloody page filling really 5 minutes of non stop listing cities sure i get that he was explaining his game but come on this annoyed me so much and it happens not once but multiple times in different forms that i just couldn't let this book be listed in the same star rating as the ok books filling pages by lists like that is cheap thinking back it might not have bothered me as much if i had read the book in stead of audiobooking it because when reading you can skip you see where the annoying list ends but in an audiofile you can't because you might skip too much or too little and i would have to open my eyes to do it thus destroying the purpose of the audiobook in my fall asleep routine so yeah only 2 stars because of that cheap book filling please authors don't do it even if you believe it to be artistic nobody likes to read the same word copied over and over well not me anyway","1046":"dark but very well written","1047":" this book is disjointed and a very different type of read this book is loud without yelling this book is dark and light this book is not linear and not an easy read all that said i enjoyed it but will have to read something rather light next while i carry this one around with me also completely random but it was oddly nice that lance u0026amp carrie were from orlando winter park fl where i just moved from which is also the town that john green's paper towns primarily takes place who q's favorite band is the mountain goats and if you were unaware john darnielle the author of this book is the front man of said band","1048":"3 5 i really loved the broken scattered narration i was never certain what to think of sean or his mind until the end more development in the deaths of l and c would've been interesting but at the end of the day this isn't a crime novel at its core felt more like a novella and beautifully done","1049":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this is kind of a weird book the basic premise and i don't think i'm giving away much in the way of spoilers since it's pretty much in all of the promotional language about the book is that a teenager tries to commit suicide and fails he's doomed to a life of disfigurement and his only solace is in an old school rpg text only game he administers via mail in a pre internet era he fashions himself as the original dungeon master for a game called trace italian in the era where nerd culture ru this is kind of a weird book the basic premise and i don't think i'm giving away much in the way of spoilers since it's pretty much in all of the promotional language about the book is that a teenager tries to commit suicide and fails he's doomed to a life of disfigurement and his only solace is in an old school rpg text only game he administers via mail in a pre internet era he fashions himself as the original dungeon master for a game called trace italian in the era where nerd culture rules this book is something of a throwback to the days of nerd culture as means of expressing oneself and connecting with those who likewise feel like freaks now of course those who are nerds make billions in silicon valley this book deeply romanticizes this time when the nerds truly faced isolation and sometimes persecution for their love of logic puzzles and fantasy games the one that the protagonist creates is something of a straightforward game based in real places like kansas i think this is in part to make the novel a bit more accessible and in part to move the plot forward in a way that becomes clear when you read the book it's a clever take on a tale of loneliness though one that's steeped in a hipster nostalgia of things gone by which shouldn't be surprising since the author is part of a band called the mountain goats more","1050":"whenever a songwriter puts out a novel it's more about the words than the plot that is most definitely the case with this book the writing is at times quite lovely but it's largely formless and rather stationery","1051":"i would have loved this even if i didn't know who wrote it but i love it more because i do","1052":"the intriguing cover and the positive reviews drew me to the book but as they say you can't judge a book by its cover about fifty pages or so into the book it was already feeling slow with a fairly undeveloped and unrelatable protagonist and even less developed ancillary characters and subsidiary plots it's a short book so i decided i should commit to finishing it and i did there are some interesting reflections on loneliness and connectivity and there's a promising premise but it just never clicked for me","1053":" reading wolf in white van casually will provide the reader with an interesting story of a troubled young man but will rob one of the more complex and creative aspects of the novel it is a short book with a nonlinear structure so i think one needs to pay close attention or miss out on john darnielle is really saying this is not one of those fun little beach books wolf in white van demands and deserves thought the story begins with a wonderful heartfelt hook that only vaguely hints at an awful event that has permanently disfigured sean phillips the young narrator by the end of the first chapter i was invested in sean's personal story and felt compelled to dig deeper and learn more about the event he calls an accident that has so dramatically altered the course of his life during the post accident hospital stay sean conceives of a game by mail wherein a player's goal is to safely traverse a dangerous post apocalyptic landscape to reach the safety of the trace italian a star shaped fortress located on the kansas plains sean mails players an envelope containing a short narrative describing their surroundings and their options and players will respond by mail dictating their actions taken and choices made originally the chapters about the game seemed like a distraction from what i felt was the real story and for a long while these chapters frustrated me i wanted to know more about sean's accident the cause and effect still pondering the book weeks later i realize the chapters about the game indeed the game itself and thus the novel are about choice and how each choice we make has a consequence we all know this at a surface level but how often do we truly consider the choices we make wolf in white van begs the reader to pay attention to each decision point in our lives since finishing wolf in white van i have been hyperaware of the recent choices i have made often tracing those decision points back several steps to see how i arrived at the point where i had to make that decision it is a fascinating exercise but one that could potentially drive a person mad for your consideration if you don't brush your teeth you will develop a cavity and you will have to go to the dentist to get the cavity filled on the way home from the dentist you decide to floor it through a yellow light but you don't make it and collide with cross traffic had you made the decision to brush properly you might not have developed that cavity and would not have had a dentist appointment that day meaning you likely would not have been at that street intersection at that time and thus would not have been forced to react to the yellow light or try to get through it and would not have been involved in the car accident consider then the branching effect of each of your decisions and how other lives are affected by them had sean made different decisions than the ones he made leading up to his disfiguring accident he would not have ended up in the hospital and would not have created the game had he not created the game the two teens that took the game too far and ended up involved in their own tragic event would not have been placed in the situation in which they found themselves the title of the novel comes from a childhood memory sean recalls about watching a talk show on television the guest panel discussed the alleged satanic messages heard when some music albums are played backward on one such record the guests swore they could hear the phrase \"wolf in white van\" none of them knew what it meant but were certain the message was sinister in nature this scene seemed like a throwaway to me but upon further contemplation i realized that the novel was also being presented backward with sean retroactively revealing the details of his accident with the final scene being the event itself i feel like i might be reading too much into this though because for the life of me i cannot discern any meaning in structuring the novel this way concluding the novel with the climax is certainly powerful and grim but is the backward structure of the novel as meaningless as the backward messages on the records intended to incite baseless and stumbling prattle much like that of the talk show's guest panel i feel like i have either been duped into putting unnecessary thought into something or i have entirely missed one of darnielle's points or am i getting darnielle's joke without realizing it throughout wolf in white van's 207 pages the exact nature of sean's horrible accident is slowly revealed with a new tantalizing and horrific detail provided with each new anecdote of his life each of which is presented with brutal and familiar honesty it is these sections that drove me toward wolf in white van's stunning conclusion i use the word \"stunning\" not as a convenient adjective but in the literal sense upon reading the final sentence i realized i had stop breathing i inhaled a great gasp of air and let my body collapse backward slapping my head on the wall behind my bed i stared into nothingness for a good long while thinking sympathizing and empathizing since then wolf in white van has stayed with me choices","1054":"not a huge fan of this book to me the story was inconsistent choppy going back and forth between stories that i didn't always understand the connection too also to me he had many more great stories that could have been written and he he chose the most boring story of the bunch","1055":" i really desperately wanted to love this book i tore through it quickly becoming easily immersed in sean's world and the world of trace italian there was so much i wanted to know about sean and his life so much that was left unanswered i was initially left feeling extremely frustrated that the ending of the book which is really the beginning wasn't everything i had expected but then i came on goodreads and went through a dozen or so reviews of people who had learned amazing things from this book who had clearly gotten it so much more than i had and now i respect it much more i think i will need to revisit this one again after i've given myself some time to think it over to try to figure out exactly what darnielle wanted his audience to take from his novel","1056":" a perfect book in many ways just be prepared for it to send you into a dark claustrophobic headspace at times and if you're expecting a formulaic story this book will leave you hanging on some levels one of the central conflicts of the plot gets wrapped up almost immediately and there's at least one character introduced that i thought for sure would become crucial to the story later but is never heard from again etc i get the feeling this is all done intentionally though to avoid giving you too much resolution or payoff and it's what makes the book so haunting in the end","1057":" this book is about i think the danger of getting trapped in your imagination but then again it might be about something completely different it is written in a very dreamy disconnected style that outlines an action the narrator took that significantly altered the course of his life i'm being intentionally oblique to not spoil the reveal he spent some time in the hospital and while there he invented a mail order fantasy game that allows him to interact with other souls like himself who are interested in exploring the landscape that the narrator has created the author of this book is in a band and his skills as a lyricist are apparent in the beautiful imagery that appears throughout this book particularly the segment discussing the narrator's discovery that the devil or the wolf in white van may actually be out there and seeking to get to him","1058":" i didn't like this at all but i feel like maybe i didn't get it i went in with high expectations and maybe that's part of it if i didn't love the mountain goats maybe i wouldn't have been expecting a novel on par with the music i couldn't care less about rpg du0026amp d stuff which made most of this book incredibly hard to get through it felt like it was trying really hard to be super meaningful and poignant but never got there for me because i couldn't understand sean's motivations or his inner life i finished it knowing it was probably a good book but i'm not the right reader","1059":"not a fan the story had potential but there is no real moral to the story or reason behind anything i guess that's the point but this book did nothing for me","1060":"i feel like a traitor in not liking this book since i love john darnielle's mountain goats incarnation i wanted so much to like the book and made myself keep with it hoping that things would fall into place if it were anyone else i would have bailed and i pretty much never bail on books it pains me to say that it never did fall into place it was like the mumbled whisper of the echo of a shadow of something promising i kept having this sense that there was more for me to put together to puzzle through and if only i did it'd be great the narrative was just too disconnected for me and the main character was too distant for me to connect to oh well","1061":"i really didn't like this one","1062":"what the actual fuck is this book what a waste of time why won't goodreads let me give 0 stars for the longest 200 pages i've ever read","1063":" i love the mountain goats this feels a lot like it could be the backstory behind a mountain goats song i have to say john darnielle is a fantastic story teller and he really uses the inverted time narrative well the text adventure angle was cool and the unraveling of choices back through time gave it an interesting spin at this point i should mention that this is a very dark novel it grapples with view spoiler a failed suicide attempt and its aftermath my main gripe is that while the narrator talks about events and episodes piecing them together there is very little revealing the motivations of the characters lance and carrie suddenly decide the game is real but there isn't a lot of explanation as to why ch drops out of the game mysteriously and the central episode the suicide attempt all of these were things that happened but there wasn't any exposition or big reveal i guess i was left with a big why at the end which may have been the feeling he wanted to invoke i guess hide spoiler","1064":"movies and books are more powerful so often in the spaces in what they don't show knew darnielle's writing was good since his lyrics regularly slay me and after reading master of reality recommended i was ready and waiting for this the story unwinds and completes itself without ever really completing itself and he has a way of writing about feelings and emotion that sneaks up on you and quietly kills you with quick unexpected blows","1065":"i don't know this stream of consciousness narrative reminds me of catcher in the rye like holden sean is very troubled and you still don't understand the full amount of his pain by the end not a happy book but a good book","1066":"very twisted and dark interwoven with detailed fantasy it's a complicated and layered story just not the one i was prepared to read","1067":"at times the prose was too flowery for me not quite purple perhaps lavender at other times i thought it worked well there were descriptive evocative similes and metaphors that haven't been used to the point of their becoming cliche the way the story unfolds is rather disconcerting it's almost like an object submerged in murky water you know that there's a thing there and you see it in bits and pieces when you collect enough glimpses you connect them in your head to flesh the object out several times my intuition as to the connections proved incorrect and i needed to tear away some of my reconstruction and build anew the jarring part is that the novel is written in the first person so the fact that you get these bits and pieces in a non standard order lends an overall amnesiac feel to the narrative which is probably sort of the point to it all","1068":"betrayed by jacket copy i would have been so happy with this book if it has stuck to the written premise a man with a severe disfigurement from an old mysterious incident that is slowly revealed throughout the course of the novel invents a mail based rpg game and becomes entangled in the lives of two of his subscribers who take the game off the page and into real life that is not what this book is i love nonlinear storytelling but this book gets lost in so many tangents and ephemeral musings that when a scrap of plot did show up it was gone in the blink of an eye rarely advancing the story at all many others including renowned critics and award juries have disagreed with me but if you're thinking of this as something like the spiritual successor of ready player one you will be severely disappointed","1069":"you should avoid seeing too much of yourself anywhere in the outside world in others in the imagined worlds that give you shelter the book that i see more of myself in than i should publicly admit i loved this of course i did","1070":" this new turn from you tells me what all i got by cleaning out the corpse of the fortune teller ok i got silver earrings and some crystals and some old money and some vials of something that i bet are anti infective stuff and i got a knife with crescent moon in the handle of it ok i am saying that the knife is a pretty big knife that my dude has been using to skin deer i drag his body out behind his shack and i use the knife to dig in the dirt behind the house the dirt is a little soft because it's near the house getting some shadow instead of out under the baking sun all day i get tired but i clear just enough space to get this guy in i don't know who killed him and nobody's ever going to know i scoop enough dirt back on top of him to cover his body and i say out loud something about how i hope all seekers make it to where they're going and then i take the knife and stab myself in the neck i bleed out on top of the fortune teller's grave and then i'm dead and that's my game i am ok and i'll be ok but this is the end and this is my story ch","1071":"wolf in white van \"some lessons you learn gradually and some you learn in a sudden moment like a flash going off in a dark room \"fair warning this review is going to be short and negative okay so i had to really power through this one i did not like the writing style the jumps between past and present the story or the main character none of these things were compelling to me interesting to me or had any semblance of cohesiveness the only redeeming factor was the shortness of this boo wolf in white van\"some lessons you learn gradually and some you learn in a sudden moment like a flash going off in a dark room \"fair warning this review is going to be short and negative okay so i had to really power through this one i did not like the writing style the jumps between past and present the story or the main character none of these things were compelling to me interesting to me or had any semblance of cohesiveness the only redeeming factor was the shortness of this book to be quite honest there was something very very difficult about this novel that made reading it very unclear and labored i refuse to dnf books once i start them and from all of the raving reviews i thought this would have picked up or made some sort of huge philosophical breakthrough so i just kept on chugging and by the end i felt like it was all for nothing overall not anything near amazing or special to me it would be a one star but that cover is pretty nice more","1072":"there's a ton of great material here but i feels like there's not much for payoff great style and individual scenes though","1073":"good though hard to review mt goats aren't my cup of tea so that wasn't the draw i guess it just speaks to the endless nothing that is life certainly how i felt about my high school years wishing for something interesting also yeah i did read a lot of conan books man i loved those titles","1074":"for me this book came in enveloping images that were excruciatingly real perhaps it's because i listened to it rather than read it darnielle's words are little paintings that jesus i definitely don't want to live in but i want to read listen to over and over again this was the perfect example for me of how an author can live inside another's head and explain it perfectly without either of us ever having been that person","1075":"when i first started reading this i was afraid it would be a stream of conscious type of book kind of like satin island by tom mccarthy but i was pleasantly surprised there is a sense of hopeless and a lot of mystery within this book that keeps you reading just so you can find out why this kid was in the hospital why he created this game and why he's just so lonely it's very poetic and the writing especially about his childhood is beautiful i'm still just a little confused by the ending but overall great","1076":"the prose was great i'm not sure i really got the book though","1077":" i really picked this one up on a whim a lot of people i know think the mountain goats are the best thing to grace the planet since sliced bread but i just don't get it i am surprised i read an entire book by john darnielle in light of my resistance to listen to a 3 minute god forbid 4 minute song he wrote but i'll admit it - this wasn't bad it was written well and structured in a very unique way i think i get what he was going for here a lot of stream of consciousness with fill in the blank type plot lines i liked the narrator of this sean he was living with a disability and felt really honest in a way but overall this left me feeling really unsatisfied i felt like i just read the last 200 pages of a much longer book and was missing big chunks of information and while i'm sure was intentional as part of the appeal i did not jive with it there's a line where sean says \"i felt... like i was either missing out on something or being let in on a big secret or someplace in the space between those two possibilities \"that's exactly how i felt while reading this book i know a lot of people love this kind of work but i just didn't","1078":"it definitely makes you think","1079":" mostly i read this book because joseph fink was excited about it i thought the rp by mail thing was really cool and well done but by the second half the book lost me there were occasional gems of prose but overall i did not really like this book it's almost impossible to discuss the meaning of book without spoilers so spoilers ahead i think this book just makes me angry view spoiler i am so tired of stories about violent men like yeah i see the point being ~taking your fantasy too far ~ sean has been fantasizing about being a barbarian warlord for years and culminates his fantasy by attempting to kill himself and his family with all the news about school shootings i don't think this is the kind of character that needs any more attention in this society unless we're going to critically examine the kind of toxic masculinity that leads to it there's no real explanation as to why he does it and i find it really frustrating and pointless and yeah i see the mirror between him and lance interesting that he didn't die but carrie did unimpressed hide spoiler","1080":"although i can see why this books won an alex award this year it was just too disjointed and a downer for me to enjoy darnielle never really explored why the narrator did what he did to himself so i was left with a feeling that too much was unresolved","1081":"well now i'm frustrated this book had so much potential the idea behind it is just brilliant but the actual story didn't live up to my expectations at all i'm really disappointed","1082":"well written interesting comparisons intriguing plot relatable sad lovely i enjoyed reading but in the end wished i loved this book more than i did at times sparse in detail and description therefore difficult for me to create a really clear heart wrenching three dimensional understanding of the characters for a first novel it's a serious accomplishment it's a quick read so i recommend it to human beings","1083":" there's this feeling that strikes me when i am alone outside between the hours of 12 01 am and first light i could be walking home from a party or driving back from a long trip or i might even be camping but i am alone and in the dark and exposed to the elements and i am convinced that there is something tangible beyond the borders of the nameless dark waiting for me to turn around perhaps it is the product of an imagination exposed to serial mystery novels at an early age or an acute sense of nervous dread wolf in white van is that feeling in book form and i loved every damn minute of it","1084":"one of the best books i've read in the past decade as i think about it a lot i've gone back and read passages and will return to it in its entirety at some point at just over 200 pages its not a huge task i don't want to say too much about the book but after reading a bunch of the reviews i think a lot of people missed the basic concept of the book most of the negative reviews did and some of the positive reviews did as well if i had to pigeon hole this book in one phrase it would be an anti coming of age story but its much more it's a story of isolation expectations introversion imagination and coping but it also uses music pop culture and literature references to tell its tale it does bounce around in time and it's arc is backwards in respect to more standard novels but it does solve a mystery at the end and if you take time to think about it the resolution makes some sort of sense it is kind of a mind blower you can read the other reviews for plot lines","1085":" i got up last night at 2am thinking about how to repair my rifle i don't even have a rifle except in the trace his final move began i was asleep then i was awake and the first thing i thought about when i woke up was this rifle with the special attachment i took from the fortune teller's body a body i took three turns to find and another turn to strip of anything useful to me and sean i could smell body when i thought about this hot new mexico sun human body and so i don't think i can play anymore it took me almost two months to read a 204 page book i literally read three pages a day and re read my favorite passages over and over i just didn't want to leave i felt like sean and i had some sort of understanding so many of his thoughts and experiences in wiwv resonated with me which now that i think about it should be worrisome i think one of the reasons i had an emotional connection to this book is because it brought up so many memories of my mom when i was a little girl i loved playing this text based rpg similar to trace italian on my mother's ibm wang pc ah to be born in the 80's lol i even remember some of the prompts you're a little wizard you're standing in the middle of a clearing in the forest to the north of you is a cave to the east is an impassible wood to the west is a river in your pocket is a potion in your hand is a sword what would you like to do i would spend hours on that thing but luckily i never got as deep into it as lance and carrie oh and also qdoba i couldn't believe darnielle mentioned qdoba in this book i wanted to cry sometimes my mother would get me something from qdoba on her way home from work just because always qdoba never chipotle if you don't know what this means i can't explain it to you lol note people who are into baja fresh must remain neutral on this one lol okay way to much digression back to the book i'm sure anyone who sees this cover in person has to admit that it's gorgeous it definitely pulled me out of the cloud and brought me back to physical books but the content contained within may not be for everybody how you feel about this novel will be largely dependent on what you expect to get from the experience of reading a book this book throws linearity out the fucking window the narrative jumps from past to present from present to memories from real to imagined and it usually does all this seamlessly if that's a problem then this is not the book for you there is some structure darnielle seems to have taken great care with the way his story is mapped out because he knew it would be told in reverse but there isn't really a plot i feel darnielle's wordplay was enough to keep me interested but if you need for there to be a clearly defined point lesson to the 200 pages you've read this is not the book for you i thought about the fact that imaginary girls drove me nuts because there was no real plot just a writer stringing words together nicely on the page yet now faced with a similar issue i didn't just look past it i loved it i can't explain why but wiwv is just different better more filling the narrator sean isn't telling you a story so much as he's letting you wander around his thoughts he's an unreliable narrator because he clearly suffers from some type of mental illness perhaps schizophrenia or psychopathy or at the very least delusional thinking but he still came across as open and trustworthy and i liked him and even though sean's not trying to be misleading his implied pathology leads you to believe that his view of things is probably skewed and of course we don't get a concrete answer to the question that we all including other characters in the novel want to know why did you do it but i have a theory view spoiler i think sean realized the violent thoughts daydreams hallucinations that began as a child were getting worse and he would probably soon have a unstoppable desire to hurt someone in the real world he got thisclose to hurting his own parents so he tried to kill himself to protect the world from the darkness that was growing inside him and even though his attempt was unsuccessful i think he was still able to silence that voice for the most part hide spoiler i would have loved for sean to share everything to confess once and for all why he did it but i imagine that would have opened a door he couldn't close and well and also lots of colons random questions does anyone understand why sean talks about being filled with like indescribable joy in the beginning which i guess is technically the end why exactly was he so lackadaisical about getting more reconstructive surgery that would have yielded better results","1086":" i applaud the author for the original concept of this book as well as the outstanding prose after a disfiguring injury sean who now must live in his mind creates a game by mail called trace italian he is able to make a modest living from this game which is endangered by the unfortunate fate of two of the players despite physical and mental despair with this he finds something to live for something in which he is engaged a place he escape to when his stress level is high i wish i could have connected more with this story and with sean as well there is much about music old movies and other cultural references which maybe because i am not a gamer i could not relate the book is structured so that the ending is basically told first and the present told last there are many references along the way so that the ending which is really the beginning is not a shock","1087":"this book unspools in reverse and i probably didn't give it the attention it deserved which made for a disorienting auditory experience i think i will have to check out the physical book and revisit my opinion later","1088":"one of the most intense audio books i've ever listened to definitely worth your attention if you're in a certain kind of mood","1089":"this book took me a long time to get in to but in the end i couldn't put it down i found it very soothing in its methodic descriptions of the mind and an interesting experiment in the limitations of reality","1090":"the writing was melancholy and nostalgic feeling i loved that but i felt like i couldn't understand the point the book was trying to make i spent some time after it finished thinking about it but it didn't seem to really stick with me too much","1091":" if you are the sort of person who never seems to get what everyone else is saying or doing who as a kid was one hop out of step with your family marching to the beat of a different drum then i think you'd enjoy this novel i found it a little hard to get into but as soon as i'd finished it i went back and reread the first few pages i usually go into novels with no pre research but this one might have benefited from some background because it's not a linear easy read view spoiler if you untangle the story which jumps around all over the place the mc a misunderstood loner who invests heavily in graphic novels and fantasy shoots himself in the face for no apparent reason when he's sixteen recovering from that horrific injury he invents a game a role play fantasy where people are escaping across a post apocalyptic landscape the game is played through the mail a player subscribes makes a move is mailed the next scenario with options mails back his her strategy and so on two teenagers take the game too literally and take themselves off to the desert in search of the city at the end of the quest trace italian and subsequently die through exposure as the rescue next scenario they were expecting naturally doesn't happen as they are in real life not the fantasy trace italian game charges are brought against the mc he's let off with no case to answer we never find out why he shoots himself aged sixteen other than it seemed like a good idea at the time hide spoiler given all that why did i enjoy this book well i guess i am the kid who always marched to a different beat i still do i still as sean does go through life imagining i'm a character in book i still find most people and their interests and concerns utterly alien i identified with this guy and the words spun a bit of a magical web around me i'm frustrated with the book hence the four stars for lack of answers but then that's only true to life people do inexplicable things in real life too","1092":"i love this book so completely and i've found a home in the character of sean i cant really describe what this book made me feel but to have thoughts you struggle with put into words just creates some kind of magical bond and i can't wait to read this book again and again","1093":"well executed for a debut novel given the structure he uses it's still tight not a bad quick read sidenote that has nothing to do with the book i listened to about half of this on audiobook and figured john darnielle's voice would be deeper after having listened to the mountain goats","1094":"full disclosure at age 15 my friends and i became completely immersed in a bbs text based rpg called major mudd so my opinions about this novel are completely colored by that experience i can't stop thinking about this continue thinking about book i don't want it to stop consider writing letter to the author why won't john darnielle answer my pleas to continue writing await a response that will never arrive maybe someone else will read it and we can continue towards the trace italian together hand book to husband with recommendation that he read it at once maybe if i write a cryptic review others will become curious enough to join me write words on world wide web what should i read in the meantime leaves this moment","1095":"like that chuck palahniuk novel if someone with less malevolence and more talent but a serious commitment to not advancing the plot had written it","1096":"i could have given it five or three stars it's still roiling in my head perhaps it's a modern day catcher in the rye about the kid who doesn't feel he fits in either way my mistake was in reading a review before i read it that told the whole story i recommend going in blind and letting it unfold it is a page turner","1097":" so umm time to disentangle my complicated if altogether positive feelings about wolf in white van the first thing i should say about it is that i read it cover to cover pretty continuously over a 1 2 day period if that says anything the second thing i want to say is that i wish somebody'd nominated it for yuletide and requested it and then that someone else had written an if game homage in inform or whatnot to trace italian except not me because that would take so much time and be intimidating maybe andrew plotkin basically what i am saying is i want andrew plotkin to write an if game fanfic for wolf in white van for yuletide this year why can't i have powers like the cornfield kid in the twilight zone probably some vague and oblique spoilers under the cut though i'll try to avoid it view spoiler this was kind of an inverse \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" experience for me with wiwv i loved the parts in general--was genuinely engrossed found individual sentences paragraphs passages both quite well written and very resonant--but by the end i was sort of unsatisfied by what they added up to it's like they were 80% of their promised trajectory and the missing 20% was like... the missing emotional keystone to a lot of things part of it was that it was all leading up to an apparent full reveal which was both very simple and very evident from the beginning and only had one piece that i thought was particularly striking or surprising and part of it was-- because of that narrative shyness about obvious \"reveal \" it never really was able to go in depth into that thing or the what or why of that thing and yeah i get there may have been a literary point to make about that thing intrinsic to that but it's not one i agreed with much at all suffice to say i think sean rang really true when the author was being specific and honest about him and less convincingly when the narrative was being... cagey i guess or treating certain psychological things as an unknowable mystery the titular structure in wiwv is very clever when you get to the part of the text that references \"wolf in white van\" and what it therefore means about the book it imbues it all with sort of a hopeful takeaway which i appreciate both about this story and john darnielle's work in general so anyway--liked the writing in general everything about trace italian the general atmosphere of trace italian both the excerpts from it and every passage discussing it the basic concept of the lance and carrie subplot so many observed details about sean's life and the way he emotionally reacted to things sean's parents sean's horrible parents sean's heartbreaking awful squick inducing entirely real parents and the way he feels about them god sean's pov altogether the ambivalent authorial viewpoint on escapism the passage near the very end in flashback about southern california which was one of the keenest things i've read as a semi southern californian the structure didn't like the blankness and anticlimax of the ending that 80% feeling i was talking about the similar lack of weight and time accorded to lance and carrie and what they did the commitments to mystery where direct psychological exploration would've served the story better in some ways even if sean's pov wouldn't face it head on the thematic half formedness hide spoiler so yeah wolf in white van is good though and i feel like particularly anyone with a strong interest in if adventure games would get something out of it and anyone with a personal connection to redacted might get something visceral out of it like i did but also be left frustratingly unfulfilled like i was i'll be reading jd's future fiction efforts though if they happen","1098":"because we had already been told what happened very early on the climatic ending was not climatic at all i was just left wondering why why did he do it and what a very stupid thing to do","1099":"i read this book relatively quickly it trips over its own pretentiousness at every turn nodding only perfunctorily at what is quite a serious subject while wallowing in some sort of escapist nihilism that masquerades as art i was disappointed at its ending but i was thrilled it was over","1100":" this book is a wonderful it truly is a stunner and a gem one that once you pick it up you will come to have the utmost respect for john darnielle he is a magnificent writer who is capable of diving into human emotion connection and empathy i must admit this book did take me awhile to read at times i found myself stopping after a sentence paragraph or statement and really thinking about it in depth i was transported to this other realm while reading this novel and became so completely immersed in the main character's sean's story and his game trace italian this story does jump around as sean describes the fantasy of trace italian and then his reality what i loved most about this story was that it is told backwards where the reader finds more about the case and what happened in sean's accident that started it all it was easy to follow and interesting i wanted to know what happened both in the court case and his injury i cared about sean as a character and wanted to see him happy","1101":"this book follows sean phillips creator of the infamous italian trace game a person with a vivid imagination and ability to create adventures he guides players through a word he creates when one of the games takes a turn for the worse it changes how he forever sees the world around him and the people in it more about this book can be found on my blog http hesaidbooksorme blogspot com","1102":"glorious like a fleshed out mountain goats song full of lyrical u0026amp intense emotional specifics teenage identity formation u0026amp white metal du0026amp d culture interpersonal nuance threaded through a dense intriguing narrative warrants re reading like the game narrative inside the story the book's prose seemed full of clues that might unfold when you pay closer attention","1103":"darnielle has created a first person narrator with an engaging voice but the story he tells never engaged me","1104":"like its title this novel is off kilter in a familiarly strange way what strikes me the most while reading is the deliberate pacing the novel slowly releases bits of information forming a picture that clarifies with each chapter the characters are unique but it's the subtext which underlies the impact of the story by the end i am amazed somehow this simple story of complicated people wraps itself around your thoughts","1105":"liked the pbm aspects but was a little unfulfilled with the overall stories","1106":"haunting tale of loneliness and alienation and how fantasy can provide a necessary and healing escape for those who need it most","1107":"well written but the overall plot was a little disappointing great novel for a first time author","1108":"after reading the inside cover i was a little concerned that i was about to read a book a lot like ready player one which along with ender's game are the two most overrated science fiction novels i have encountered now just so i am clear both ready player one and ender's game were entertaining and well written books but especially in the case of ender's game i felt that it's reviews on goodreads along with the major sciene fiction awards were not justified i mean people rank ender's game ahead of dune which to me is ridiculous but i digress wolf in white van the second novel by john darnielle was a risky purchase at $24 00 i am so glad i am the proud owner of this wonderful novel nothing is what it seems in this shocking tender claustrophobic recursive novel where a disfigured young man invents a snail mail game he can orchestrate from home everything about this unique novel felt occluded john darnielle is listed on the back flap as widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation he is the lead singer of the mountain goats apparently when it comes to lyricists i have been living under rock because i had never heard of him or his band however the writing in this 207 page novel is very interesting i got the feeling that every word was chosen for a very particular reason and a sense of menace and impending doom seemed to lurk behind every sentence paragraph chapter the ending did not quite fulfill the promise of this excellent character study but i would give it 4 5 stars if goodreads allowed it because the journey and the amount of suspense developed in such a short novel is really impressive rarely do you find something that is truly original and wolf in white van is that novel","1109":"disturbingly beautiful beautifully disturbing","1110":"from the moment i found out that john darnielle was going to release a book i knew i would love it i was right i did i've always been fascinated by his lyrics and this book had the same effect on me i couldn't put it down it's written so beautifully it's the best i've read this year","1111":"the incredible wonderfully composed final chapter elevates the book from very good to great","1112":" a short but intense book that hit very close to home for me the narrator sean phillips not to be confused with ed brubaker's frequent artistic collaborator on graphic novels is the creator of several play by mail rpgs most notably trace italian a sort of fallout esque post apocalyptic survival game he came up with as he was recovering from an unknown accident which left his face disfigured we find bits and pieces about this mentioned almost casually as the narrative continues the extent of sean's facial reconstruction the nature of the injury and finally what happened exactly on the night in question sean's thoughts turn to his own childhood reading conan novels watching krull the widening gap in understanding between himself and his parents and to more recent events most notably the consequences of two of his young players taking trace italian into larp with one of them ending up dead and the other suffering permanent damage due to cold and starvation i've been reading watching and listening to a fair number of books movies and albums that bring to mind growing up in the 80s being a teenager in the 90s arcade fire's the suburbs the excellent video game gone home much of sean's childhood is relatable though the specifics are very different from my own experience i have no personal point of reference for sean's physical pain but as someone who spends most of his time living in imaginary worlds out of sheer dislike for the one i actually live in and the other people in it as someone whose imagination has possibly done more self directed harm than good this is a novel that was more substantial than its 203 pages if there's even one criticism i have it's that it just sort of ends on a climactic moment but it still feels abrupt which given sean's disbelief in endings may have been intentional i'll have to give this a reread sometime to work out the pieces of the puzzle i was unable to fit together","1113":"it's the sort of book you read in three hours and then think about it for ten it's an elliptical novel which while going back in time circles closer and closer to the original incident that set the whole thing in motion the incident in which sean the narrator lost his face literally his new condition of looking like a one person freak show has him practically house bound so he invents other worlds and sets his mail subscription role playing games there sean is not the sort of guy who was very popular before when his mother worries he would be lonely after he leaves the hospital he says \"i was going to be lonely anyway \"the whole thing is about choices like in trace italian sean's game you 'choose your own adventure' but the choice is an illusion you take all these turns but you can never really lose and you can never really win - that's the way the whole thing is designed to keep you playing the most daring think you can do is to opt out and leave the game altogether like chris the guy who quit on his own terms most of the time we don't know why we do the things we do the choices we make follow some unexplained impulses and we struggle to provide a coherent explanation to back up our decision making sometimes we decide the best thing to do would be to dig a hole and stay in it and when we realise it was a mistake it's too late and we're too weak to crawl out this happened in this book too we don't know why we do what we do at the time let alone later our old selves are a mystery to us we keep the memories but the hero of those memories is a stranger to us the phrase 'wolf in white van' comes from the supposed subliminal messages hidden in rock and metal songs you know if you play them backward satan will speak to you this is also what this novel does with its back to front structure so what is the hidden message here is there any or am i just hearing things because i decided i would hear them maybe the supposed message is just accidental or maybe it can be only understood by a chosen few the narrator asks why the devil can't speak clearly why he hides and obscures his message which seems rather counter productive from the marketing point of view similar complaints were voiced by some reviewers who just wanted the book to speak to them clearly and explain everything in capital letters ha ha that's not how the devil talks or john darnielle i would've probably given this book five stars if i was one of those sad misunderstood teenagers but i wasn't i did spend a lot of time alone but was perfectly content to get on with my strange projects and i never felt there was something that needed understanding maybe i was just blessed with the right kind of parents but my diary was full of cringe inducing entries in which i described how happy i was and how perfect the world was i miss being that person it wasn't until i was 25 when a whole zoo moved into my head","1114":"strange backwards story sean who was disfigured in an accident creates make believe worlds that real people try to navigate two teenagers mistake it for real and one dies while the other is seriously hurt the story is sean's journey through the court case and why he creates these worlds along with how he was disfigured","1115":" when this book is good it's powerful and the writing is on point chilling and dangerous alternating with a mundanely familiar nostalgia but then sometimes i feel the author's hand a little too heavily in the story's flow there are a lot of cerebral themes in the book reality bending to the imagination choices that inevitably move us down a path we can't reverse from the cause and effects of violence the instability and secrecy of state of mind are we thinking for ourselves at all or are we guided by other forces if the latter who's in control wolf in white van is a totally captivating read it's hard to stop thinking about its symbolism events and characters even when you know something awful is coming and it does spoilers after this point but then darnielle intentionally diverts information where we expect to find it not unlike the game master central character we don't go any further into the present than the book's start so it feels like a game unfinished i missed that sense of resolution that comes from seeing all the puzzle pieces fit into place those moments of author presence just made me feel like i was missing something and that's where i just didn't enjoy myself as a reader sometimes i feel like i was supposed to be as captivated by the game trace italian just as much as i was captivated by a world in which a mysteriously disfigured man drinks beers with teenagers in a parking lot during the day or steadies a half nostalgic eye on dangerous playground equipment and televangelist shows and slivers of other people's lives by mail human contact without human contact but no the time inside the trace italian made me impatient to return to real life for sean whatever that is or was it seems that was intentional on the part of the author to lose you every so often as a reader it felt like white noise interference on a radio signal it mimics the world of the central character sean who floats through his world like a dream the real world the concerns and guidance of the people who want him most to thrive his parents his doctors become a drone but he hears and sees things no one else can and he tunes into that instead no one can understand him when he speaks he chooses to live into his own mind the world he created and the people willing to exist there sometimes the words are white noise on the page but frankly maybe it wouldn't be white noise to you at all if you're really into being a gamer i don't know but anyway i loved reading this and i could probably keep going on about it forever at the same time i can't help but feel that unfinished feeling of something important just out of reach","1116":"a true wordsmithi knew darnielle to be an amazing lyricist so the bar was high i am pleased to say i was not disappointed an incredibly well crafted novel","1117":"review forthcoming at htmlgiant","1118":"this is a very mysterious book that reveals itself slowly and in an interesting way i really liked it a lot","1119":"quick note for library folks should this comes up in a search for troubled teen lit it's not ya and will be a tough sell for book club it is mostly not conan the barbarian fan fiction it is a good motivator to acquire long term disability insurance unlike npr's review i can't assume most readers are familiar with the mountain goats darnielle's long running band but there's going to be a high degree of appreciation overlap literacy with darnielle's semi autobiographical half inspiring and half horrifying worldview alienation casual violence transcendental acceptance might make for an easier read that said it's captivating well crafted and with the kind of structure where sticky notes and a pencil may be needed and i am not glad exactly but thoughtful grateful to have read it note to self writing reviews at 2 am while still in literary headspace is a terrible idea and you should stop doing it tw view spoiler guns suicide attempt more mentions of satanism than you can shake a stick at deaths of secondary characters hide spoiler","1120":"i haven't read anything quite like this just heard it was nominated for a national book award it deserves to be","1121":"i've been finished with this book for about a week if i reviewed it right away i would have given it only 2 stars after letting it soak in i'm back up to 4 it's a harsh subject you know from the beginning that the narrator has had a terrible past what happened is revealed slowly in drips then all in one gush i wouldn't call it a fun summer read the writing though is very good there were times when i just stopped and thought about how it made me want to be a better writer","1122":" i want to white knight this book so hard but i almost feel like it was too good for this generation so why bother it feels like something i should have found in my older stepbrother's room in like '86 and read on the weekend while he was out with his cool friends this is an i am the cheese for the modern era perhaps darnielle is just so warm and tender and humanistic toward that very specific genus of late seventies through mid eighties older brother shitheel bedecked in jean jacket and smoking behind the dumpster while sketching a barbarian raping a villager or splitting a skull but without inappropriately glorifying or humanizing that sort of burnout turd he's still a human even as a dumb flawed confused one universe","1123":"4 5this was unexpectedly great a dark 80's male teenager meditation on free will that was really far removed from mountain goats lyrics nothing else to say","1124":" loved the way this story unfolds you know right up front there is something but it takes until the very last chapter for the picture to come into focus complex nuanced main character perfect amount of existential vaguery the storyline feels more like life than the neatly tied up little package of a more traditionally structured novel finished and immediately began re reading to catch what i'd missed the first go round also like ready player one this one dusted off open some cobwebby areas of my brain when i was in high school a trio of kids from the other school in town went missing and they later were found in colorado after one of them murdered the other two an unhealthy preoccupation with du0026amp d was definitely part of the official explanation","1125":"this book pulls no punches and is a brutal ride from start to finish it's hard to read especially for people who have struggled with depression and suicidal ideation but it is definitely an important one darnielle's prose is gorgeous and his thematic mastery is ever present coursing through this story of the pervading effect of depression is the goal of the main character's game to find a place of safety that is revealed to be almost impossible to reach","1126":"if this story was told in a linear fashion it would truly be the most depressing story ever written about teenagers and every parent's nightmare instead the reveal of switching back and forth makes it slightly more interesting but i still don't understand the hype around this book it's far closer to we need to talk about kevin than ready player one or any nerdy gaming book","1127":"john darnielle's game is basically being the greatest songwriter of the modern age so it makes sense that his debut novel is an emotionally devastating masterpiece","1128":" as i finished this book i understood why when i was a teenager my mother locked her bedroom door wolf in white van is a powerful reflection on just how unlikely it is to come through adolescence unscathed yet how incredible it is that we're able to get so far past it as to find our younger selves almost completely unrelatable after suffering both emotional and then physical trauma the main character devises a by mail role playing game in which players work through an elaborate maze in order to reach a safe fortified center make the wrong choice and you could die though it takes a number of wrong choices to amount to that each of us is trapped in such a maze never more so than in adolescence that our entire adult life hinges on decisions we make as impulsive teenagers is pretty terrifying and if you've made it out alive you should consider yourself lucky i think that may be one of the messages of this book if not the primary message john darnielle's trajectory can be traced and i don't think we've yet reached the bell of the parabola his first book master of reality seemed to sketch in the way of all hail west texas namely the best ever death metal band out of denton it let you know that there are kids on mysterious paths and that you never have the full story but it didn't quite explore that full story wolf in white van is more mature like his life of the world to come with heavy traces of the sunset tree for whatever reason john seems to have decided that it's important to flesh out these realities after all i'm glad he has now we get to sense if not exactly understand how emotional trauma works there was a lot i liked about this book the writing is as good as you'd expect it to be that it's something of a retread of his themes made it wear on a little more than it might have knowing nothing of his other works i liked the details we got of those playing the main character's game but i guess i feel like not much came of them i think i'm going with 3 5","1129":" i just didn't get it i mean i got what it was about for the most part i just don't get why it's gotten so much fanfare i listened to this audiobook style and perhaps that was some of my problem with the book the readers voice was pleasant they played a sound effect between each what i assume was a chapter which felt kind of weird to me i felt like the story was all over the place and don't get me wrong i love tarantino movies and i get skipping time to tell stories but this just felt weird to me i had 14 days to borrow this book and it took me all of them to get through it on average i get through a book in 2 3 days listening at work i struggled with this and probably only finished it because i hate not finishing a book if you dug it good for you this gal just wasn't feeling it i do however think the book cover is very beautiful in its complex simplicity is that a thing","1130":"i was already a fan of darnielle the mountain goats so i may be biased in reading this ok this book does so much in so few pages it's amazing in that it's a book that has no plot really at all something that shouldn't work but does so well it's essentially a character study a story of a disfigured man sean and how he got that way and the effects of his bad decision as a young person have on his whole life and the lives of others you'd think a novel with no plot about a disfigured guy who suffers with pain and isolation would be torture to read but this book is pure beauty from page 1 darnielle brings you into a world that you wouldn't want to live in and shows that it is possible to be sympathetic to just about anyone in a bad situation much of the novel centers around the choose your own adventure role playing game sean runs via the mail i love the idea of people still playing a game this way in 2014 and the way sean uses the game and connecting with people through the mail to fill his world this may not be for everyone but i loved it from start to end","1131":"i once self identified as a nerd to someone who didn't know me very well and who didn't believe me i didn't try to justify it to her and i won't try to justify it here but i got sean like the nerd i am a nerd who loved to live within imaginary worlds i created my own world once and had a membership reminiscent to italian trace i grew out of it much like sean says about his customers and found myself on another path so this paragraph jumped out at me i thought about inventing a new game but the sean who built the trace is as distant from me now as the sean who view spoiler blew his face off hide spoiler is from both of us all three live in me i guess but those two and god knows how many others are like fading scents i know they're still there i could find them if i needed them but i don't need them and one of them survives only in bits and pieces they certainly don't need me they are complete just as they are i don't find that paragraph necessarily beautifully written but it is so full of truth for me i see the world and myself like sean sees it i think and his character really resonated with me what i can't decide is if the book is made better or worse by the overwhelming desire to know what and then why getting the 'what' in pieces was a clever propellant and then that heart burning question of 'why' that you know you're not really going to get answered or even understand because you're not that younger angrier earlier version of yourself anymore the pathways of our lives the choices we make these are mirrored vividly with trace losing yourself in the turns you choose you find a path of the many paths you could have chosen i particularly love sean's option every fourth move or so that he offers an opportunity to rest and restore another grer wrote that the book was about the kind of quiet momentum that builds up in a young person's troubled mind and how it can pull them under without really ever understanding why it's not really a 'here is an answer' book it's more of a 'here's what this feels like' book and this book for me at times felt like a long rest and restore rest restore remember come to terms p s halfway through the book i took a look at the author bio and photo and did a double take darnielle of the mountain goats i fucking love this song and how the hell did i not know they were based out of durham","1132":"i don't even know how to talk about this book i think i'm traumatized in a good way let's just say it's going in the favorites shelf without any reservations it's in the top three i've read this year","1133":"not at all what i expected much deeper than anticipated a good quick story and view into lives and how many paths we have","1134":"wow what a strange and beautiful book i wouldn't go so far to say that i loved it but i am really glad i read it and found it to be very very interesting the story follows sean who after being disfigured in an accident as a teen runs a play by mail roleplaying game through the story little bits about sean's past are revealed how did he come up with the game who are the players that he regrets most how was injured etc the language is languid and beautiful as we explore sean's lonely world so full of regret and shame","1135":"provisional 5 while i think about it","1136":"really going to have to think about and definitely re read this novel before i really know how i feel about it but i feel comfortable saying that i was entranced from beginning to end by the hypnotic prose and unique storytelling from perhaps my favorite songwriter in the world","1137":"covers the feeling of alienation and confusion of the teenage years but that's about all it is a sad mood piece about isolation without a lot of hope or redemption i guess i tend to like my mood pieces in 3 5 minute pop song format instead of full novels","1138":"i read this purely out of curiosity and it was okay i thought it was going places but suddenly i had five pages left and it seemed like the book had no intention of wrapping up several threads that it had started this was disappointing but i was intrigued while it lasted","1139":" i found myself frustrated by this it was one of these really interesting reads that i was rooting for you know it had all kinds of promise early on but ultimately left me cold the story itself is a fascinating dreamlike inner portrait of a damaged kid darnielle's structure plays with time putting things in reverse order for the most part and there's a defining incident at the end but there's no drama to it because it's referred to so much earlier that we know what it is and that must be intentional he obviously didn't want a shocking twist ending i guess my problem is that after reading the book i don't know what the author's intention was","1140":" dark and strange beguiling and jarring john darnielle's wolf in white van is masterpiece of stream of consciousness that tells a tragic unnerving tale of a disfigured teenager told in reverse chronological order this is not your average story of a disenfranchised alienated teenager wolf in the white van is a ballad to the weirdoes and dreamers who have inner lives that soar and always have the potential to destroy reality thought provoking and challenging not for people who like character development plot and tidy endings","1141":"this book was just weird and not in a good way i didn't feel like it was going anywhere disjointed and depressing","1142":" i could see this being the kind of a book with a cult following with fans of wolf in white van latching on to and debating a few strings that john darneille left hanging here that's kind of what's going on in my mind even after sleeping on it at the surface we're given a tale of teenage isolation and the tricks our brains play on us during those years i kept waiting for the story to twist one way or the other and tie some of those loose strings together but i'm not disappointed that whether intentional or not there are some things left for the reader to ponder","1143":" i finished this days ago and haven't been able to figure out what i wanted to write as a review and now it's been too long so i'm just gonna wing it up until maybe the final 20 pages of this rather short book i was convinced that i was going to finish it flip back to the first page and read it again i felt like there was this big swirling mass that was about to congeal and i wanted to go back and watch it all over again see the tendrils creeping closer to the center use my newly acquired knowledge of the end to be able to see their trajectory long before it was truly apparent and then i got to the end of the book and the whole thing deflated and it didn't do anything i wanted it to do or even anything i thought it might be doing and i just kind of closed it and set it down and went on with my day somehow the story that darnielle was telling was not the story i thought he was telling and everything that i found fascinating about the main character was i don't know discarded thrown away in the last few chapters and looking back it's not that i feel pleasantly tricked like when palahniuk or christopher priest pulls the rug out from under their readers i just feel like i don't know like darnielle didn't even know what the story was or how to end it but who am i to tell a person how to write their own book right which just means i didn't get it and now i feel like a philistine but but let me be snarky for a second i finished and as i was closing the book i saw the author's portrait on the inside flap of the dust jacket and i read john darnielle is a writer composer guitarist and vocalist for the band the mountain goats he is widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation he lives in durham north carolina with his wife and son and thought to myself that is one of the most incredibly pretentious things i have ever read and it made me feel better about not liking the end of the book","1144":"not sure what i think about this book parts were brilliant yet i found others parts dull and unfocused i think it needed to play out a bit more in order for me to make better sense of it","1145":"great bit much to get your head around at the start but once you get into it it's a fascinating exquisitely written read try it out you might have to think about it to get what's going on","1146":"i just finished this tonight and am feeling pretty disappointed i loved the plot the game sean's rich interior life how he'd turned his adolescent day dreamy fantasy life into a career and the subtle build up of the the story told in reverse the story consists mostly of build up for what should be a shocking reveal or at least an interesting twist but instead gets lost in the weeds and stumbles into a bleak anti climax","1147":" this is a tough book to review the whole thing feels like it takes place in a dream state like a retelling of someone's experience that is foggy half remembered and partially suppressed it doesn't march forward in the manner of a typical plot but instead makes pit stops along the way and the author plays with time it's a lot heavier than the blurb that you'll see on amazon and or goodreads suggests i feel like this book was positioned as if it's a cousin of ready player one where the imaginary strategy game is the central focus but i didn't feel like that was the case instead it's a portrait of an unhappy disassociated teen who could be any pop culture influenced kid today and the result of troubled flawed thinking and being mentally lost somewhere that's not reality but reality to him i suppose it aches with the feeling that's been captured in many books before it of feeling like an outsider anyone who has ever been a teen knows this feeling it's challenging and frustrating but i don't necessarily mean that in a negative way reading it i got the feeling that there was always this emotional undercurrent that the author was intentionally keeping just below the surface but like any interesting compelling book i'm finding it lingers with me i had to sit and think and digest it a little i love books that give me something to mentally chew on and this is one of those it's unsettling definitely and the emotion of it doesn't hit you while you're reading it so much as afterwards side note there's also some very pretty word play at work here which one would expect from an author who's day job is writing song lyrics with the mountain goats","1148":"clever beautiful frustrating could see it becoming a cult fave with disaffected youth unless of course the grown ups like it","1149":"it's rather difficult to write a review of this piece because it was rather difficult to process the premise is a fascinating one and the narrator sean move through his story with a voice i found rather captivating however that being said i felt like there was too much left unsaid at the story's close i wanted to be more invested in sean but found myself always feeling at arm's length as the reader perhaps this was the author's intent i'm not certain i may reread this one just to see if there is something to the story i'm missing","1150":"listened to the audiobook narrated by john darnielle which is the only way to fly maybe it's because i haven't slept in like 48 hours packing up the apartment but holy shit this was an amazing listen i don't think this is what happened but it feels like john darnielle read preacher saw the character arseface and thought what's the real story here and how can i put it in southern california and also make it about difficult to articulate sadness yowza","1151":"i think maybe i should read this again","1152":" a fast read which quickly drew me into the world of sean and his odd life the prose has a rhythm to it that keeps the story going which is a good trick in a narrative where not much actually happens rather not much actually happens to the present day sean there are multitudinous things happening with past sean and sometimes he talks about one thing and sometimes another and it's all pretty much up to him what's revealed and not though he does have an end point that he builds to it's actually a beginning point a catalyst and much of the time the narrative is working on putting that catalyst in a context but sean's life has a lot of dead ends and u turns as he traces his backwards way from 'finish' to 'start' in the maze of his life so nothing is straightforward i'd have given this the half star bump to bring it to 4 from 3 5 if sean as character was fuller sean as narrative turning point worked really well but his constant insistence on not letting anything matter deeply kept him at a remove from the reader one true moment of terror or anger or despair would have filled him out considerably","1153":"john darnielle is the lead singer and guitarist songwriter and sole member of the band the mountain goats i love this band this band of one darnielle is also an amazing author he is so talented and this really eats at me this really bothers me i came to this book wanting it to suck unfortunately and fortunately it didn't suck the book is really good funny and a little bit heartbreaking","1154":" i have difficulty articulating how i felt about this one because while i enjoyed it and finished in two or three sittings i can't actually wholeheartedly say that i really enjoyed it perhaps i'd read too much about it or too much about the author beforehand because the prose felt a bit too crafted throughout too much like it knew it was being read and wanted to be impressive which it was don't get me wrong there are some lovely lines but they seemed to be lovely for either shock value or the sake of being lovely they didn't really tie into anything which leads me to the ending now normally i can get wholeheartedly behind an ambiguous ending and i think the complete lack of conclusive answers is in fact the answer in this case but it wasn't at all satisfying which again i suspect may be the point i'd give wolf in white van a go if all that sounds like your thing but i can't say i'm singing its praises","1155":"very twisty tale takes some time to grasp the inner workings of the story but in all a good read","1156":"3 5i'm still not sure what to think","1157":"i finished this book yesterday and after i finished i read a lot of reviews and watched a few interviews with the author to try to get a better understanding of the plot and the author's intentions this morning i have woken up and cannot stop thinking about it it is extremely clever and very well written so carefully crafted and disturbing it is about the choices we make and why we make them and how some things just cannot be explained the author leads you exactly where he wants you and by the end leaves you wanting more and seeking explanations that just do not exist you are left feeling a lot like i imagine sean's parents felt throughout the entire book i kept waiting for clarity and for sean's actions to be explained and justified but they are not and this is clearly the authors intention for me the more i reflect on this book the storyline and the message the better it is it really is a fairly disturbing story and i think it is going to stay with me for a very long time","1158":"it's not i didn't like the topic of the book or the storyline it's just that it was all over the place and hard to keep up in the past and present it was interesting but the layout denoted it from 3 stars to two definitely interesting just not quite right","1159":" as i read this book i wondered if what sean felt at 17 was the same as those young men who have gone on shooting rampages felt sean seems to have been one of those adolescents who feels and may truly be marginalized by his peers and adrift in the world he doesn't know how to cope but he does stop himself from rampaging i don't understand that feeling as i don't remember ever feeling that lost and alone but i do get that it exists and that those who feel it face a difficult situation so in this book we start with the current time and as the book progresses we go backwards until we find out what happened that resulted in sean's gross disfigurement we spend the book in sean's head sean refers to himself as having had 3 lives before the incident that resulted in his disfigurement the years medical treatment and therapy physical speech occupational and more after the incident when he created his trace italian game and the current sean all three seans are marginalized and lonely but the current sean while he has yet to figure out why seems to have a better understanding of himself but it's hard to be sure what's outstanding in this novel is its conveyance of how lost the 17 year old sean was what's frustrating about this novel is that the grown up sean has yet to figure out why he was lost then and seems relunctant to take control measures that might improve the quality of his life by making less of a freak sean's description of himself there is no exploration of the why's sean is proud of the player that was able to remove himself from the game and become normal but sean doesn't seem to be able to do that and i'm not even sure he wants to i think this could be be a great book for an intergenerational book club to discuss","1160":"i really wanted to like this book it's gotten such rave reviews that i was expecting to be blown away no pun intended i wasn't it took a great deal to get into this book and even more effort to finish it","1161":"what a haunting voice i read this almost in one sitting and didn't want to let it go few stories told backwards are this seamless and graceful","1162":"the writing in the book was amazing i couldn't put it down i wanted to call into work to say sorry can't come in i started a great book this morning and i need to stay home to finish it","1163":"wow very different very compelling i'm not even going to try to describe it but definitely worth checking out","1164":"i read this book because it was longlisted for the national book award haunting and evocative not something i would typically pick up but i'm glad i did","1165":" full of contained power and remarkable insight wolf in white van highlights john darnielle's capabilities as a fiction writer in addition to his musical talents the novel is book ended by two tragedies one in the narrator sean's adult life and one remembered from his adolescence with the story told backward though non linear stories are becoming more commonplace rarely are they executed as well as this one sean's earlier incident is ever present throughout the story in hints and partial memories it shapes his life and worldview and reaction to the later tragedy yet the end of the story the true inciting incident still delivers a shock a very strong effort from a relatively new author wolf and white van will whet your appetite for future works of fiction and music from darnielle","1166":"outstanding telling of an interesting story from a good perspective very very solid narrative i listened to the audiobook the author has a very promising career as a reader ahead of him if he wants it better than nearly all others i've ever heard","1167":"my favorite book of the year lyrically written and not unlike darnielle's actual lyrics but still very removed from his songs delicate sometimes blunt where it needs to be sean is someone whose head space i can't and probably wouldn't want to inhabit trace italian is remarkably thought out and i wonder how much of it john worked out in full before beginning to write on top of all that the pacing is so perfect john gives you information before you realize it's the part of the puzzle you were looking for all at the right times good god i can't wait to read this again","1168":"i wanted to like this book more than i ended up actually liking it by no means do i intend to say it wasn't good there is just something bewildering about it and after i've finished it still feels incomplete but i have a feeling that might be part of the point i hope darnielle chooses to continue as a novelist though i look forward to where he goes with his next work","1169":"i wanted to like this book more than i did from the summary the plot seemed very interesting but i'm afraid that i never got it because books and any form of art are so subjective i have trouble rating it maybe it's because i never learned the evil ways of satan via playing dungeons and dragons i have never in my life played an rpg and i find video games incredibly stressful so maybe that's the thing necessary to have to enjoy this book that i clearly don't have","1170":"it was an enjoyable read but this is that vague style of writing that doesn't work for me i didn't understand the conclusion if there was one","1171":"i didn't really feel like i'd won anything but i had come through the day no worse off than i'd come into it which as i have been telling myself for many years now is a victory whether it feels like one or not this is just a goddamn fine piece of modern literature nothing else to it it's explores the fuzzy boundaries between the imagination and reality how we use the former to escape the latter the way everything about this novel reveals itself is perfect","1172":"i wanted so badly to like this book and i came into it with such high expectations seeing as darnielle is a brilliant lyricist but i found it hard to keep reading as the plot didn't hold my attention the last chapter is maybe the best one because there's a sense that you're finally going to get what happened but then even that is sort of anticlimactic at best overall i was pretty bored the writing isn't bad but it wasn't very interesting either i don't know maybe it's just not my genre","1173":" i listened to the audiobook of this read by the author i'm finding it hard to rate this book i wasn't bored i wanted to keep listening i liked it but it wasn't great i think that one problem is that a protagonist usually grows much of sean's growth happened prior to the current moment of the book and while we're told his story in a non chronological order we don't see where the growth happened sean was a typical aimless self directed teen a good boy don't get me wrong but a boy without a sense of purpose he sustains a severe life threatening life altering injury and we pop in on him many years later we learn about how he's different now than he was then but i don't get a sense of that journey for him a lot of time is spent covering his initial hospital stay to set the scene for how sean invented his role playing game and a lot of time is spent with the incident in which two of his players sustained serious injury death but i never got a sense of what that did for sean's trajectory","1174":"you could hear in the questions they asked and how they asked them that there were right answers things they wanted to hear you could also if you thought about it understand that this was a preview of what the outside world was going to be like for the foreseeable future","1175":"i approached john darnielle's first novel with some hesitation i know him from his music and he lives in the area and travels in similar circles despite being a good bit older than me i thought i might read it because i knew someone would eventually ask me if i did and i wanted to have something to say i'm more than a little surprised by how wonderful the book is whatever small connections i have with the guy are totally irrelevant wolf in white van is an amazing novel the story is slight a man living with a traumatic and disfiguring injury reaches out to a world he can no longer enter physically via a mail based role playing game darnielle examines imagination and creativity there is beautiful language there are uncompromised characters but mostly the novel is about escape who needs it and why and what forms it can take this is a rock solid debut excellent","1176":" i loved this book the audiobook is read by the author with perfect timing pacing and voice i mean it's his book after all i read this in another review and i totally agree there are lines in this book that are tattoo and graffiti worthy it's a book about a boy who lost his way if i were to write a book it would be in the same vein as this one stylistically only with withe absence of such intelligently poetic and clever lines as mr darnielle has written i am in awe of you i am going to check out the print version and read it as well","1177":" the mountain goats is my favorite band and john darnielle is the extraordinarily talented lead singer and songwriter the complex story telling involved in his songs is what makes this band so unique for me so i had to pick up this book as soon as i heard it was released i pre ordered it even i was not disappointed the story unfolds along a broken timeline jumping back and forth and slowly painting the picture of the main character's life mixing fantasy with reality in such an artful way i thought i had it figured out early on but was pleasantly surprised to find out that the back story was more complicated and more cleverly revealed than i originally thought the story is heartbreaking and unique with imperfect characters and vivid imagination i cannot personally relate to any of the specific events the character goes through from his gender to his accident to his hobbies to his tragedies nothing but at the same time the universal feelings and truths that are revealed are relatable to anyone that's the genius of it","1178":" this is a hard book to review i feel exactly the way my friend kevin does the first most of the book was quiet and plotless and nonlinear and i couldn't wait to find out more about the game this dude was writing the accident that happened when he was seventeen etc etc there wasn't much of a plot but that's okay because i don't need plot really since present day and a few years ago and twenty years ago are intertwined with no indication of where in time we are at any given paragraph that's okay too though i don't mind that sort of thing though many people do it's the kind of book where you almost can't wait to get to the end so that you can go back and start at the beginning again and see how everything fits together except that the ending is a dud and there are at least three threads that go nowhere view spoiler what was the significance of chris whatever happened to lance how come nothing ever came of the dudes in the liquor store parking lot hide spoiler maybe the lesson is life isn't a movie sometimes things are unresolved but this is a book dude so it was like a solid four whilst i was reading it and dropped to a two at the very end i don't even know if i'd recommend it to anyone pretty disappointing oh but p s the cover design is simple yet fascinating i spent a lot of time looking at it and tilting it in the light to make the title stand out killer design","1179":" wolf in white van is one of the best books i've read in a very long time it is entertaining and compelling john darnielle does an amazing job as a story teller especially for a first novel though it is full of death near deaths and disfigurement i think it is ultimately a hopeful story it grabbed me from the start and i read it very quickly taking in its 200 pages in 3 sittings and i'm confident i will read it again from my childhood i vaguely remember news and rumors of kids killing themselves after playing dungeons and dragons i distinctly remember as an early teenager watching a video at a church camp about the dangers of rock and roll satanism and music with hidden messages i'm pretty sure that video showed the kid who failed at committing suicide somehow influenced by judas priest and blew his face off with a shotgun i also remember being left alone in a church library where i found and read a book about all of the potential evil of fantasy toys and video games wolf in white van appropriates and weaves together these elements of 1980s christian paranoia with other pop culture touchstones from that decade as the backdrop for its story i think a large part of my immediate affection towards the story comes form a familiarity and fondness for the era it is in this setting that the protagonist sean phillips conjures the world of his play by mail roleplaying game trace italian sean is disfigured from a catastrophic event and in recovery and isolation crafted a deep labyrinth of a world for his players to inhabit the reader gets to understand sean through his creation of this world and his player's travels through it this is paralleled with sean's experience of trying to navigate what's left of his life and family post catastrophe the idea that a book that ends or begins with the main character becoming horribly disfigured could be hopeful seems absurd but ultimately i think it is a story about moving on to whatever comes next though this story moves backwards chronologically i think the crux of its message if there is one is move forward or die in trace italian the only sure path to death is persistently pursue a wrong course instead of moving towards the goal sean says \"it's really just simple math the whole of it there are only two stories either you go forward or you die \"\" at the end of the story in either order we aren't given insights or answers to why things happened the way they did but i do get the sense that at the chronological end we see sean preparing to move forward with his life outside of the game and the worlds he created to move forward from his disfigurement and recovery","1180":"i waited too long to review this and i can no longer or maybe couldn't ever think of anything to say that does it much justice i was gonna do my lazy review backup but that's just a gushing series of adjectives and adverbs that doesn't really say much beyond \"i liked it \" wolf in white van is a seriously impressive work of literary craftsmanship way beyond anything its pulp genre fic references would suggest maybe i just don't read enough contemporary fiction but this seems like the sorta thing that deserves to be a modern classic","1181":"i'm still a bit in shock and will probably need to let this book settle in before i properly review it read this book if you're looking for short and succinct contemplation on what it is to be alive","1182":"so good kind of makes me want to read his black sabbath novel being a teenager sucks","1183":"as a teen sean dealt with depression in a tragic way now in his 20s this book takes us through the story of how he has coped with the outcome the backwards forwards in time telling of the tale is brought about due to the accidental death of another teen who was playing a role playing game that sean invented","1184":"i guess john darnielle is gonna be famous now or whatever","1185":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i liked this book i think it was beautifully written however its 'in reverse' style is a bit too 'precious' for it to be an epic work i really liked sean's first person narration the simplicity of the prose and the richness of his inner world made a wonderful counterpoint then came the 'running in reverse' i found it a bit too artistic and in the end sean's motivation for the dirty deed to me remained a cipher the 200 page wind down was disproportionate to the finale also omitting the i liked this book i think it was beautifully written however its 'in reverse' style is a bit too 'precious' for it to be an epic work i really liked sean's first person narration the simplicity of the prose and the richness of his inner world made a wonderful counterpoint then came the 'running in reverse' i found it a bit too artistic and in the end sean's motivation for the dirty deed to me remained a cipher the 200 page wind down was disproportionate to the finale also omitting the arty chapters in particular the more than once geographical laundry lists which add little to the narrative would make this work is really a 'fat' novella not a novel so i liked this story the prose was admirable however i think the author would have had a better story if he'd thought he didn't think hed had to be an artiste more","1186":"the love child of third reich and the perks of being a wallflower maybe i may need some more time to think about this one","1187":"this one of the best books i've read in a while i can say a million things about it but am afraid i'd give too much away this is definitely the type of book you re read and pick up a different detail and take away something new each time it's a beautiful book","1188":"the timeline is really interesting and it made me go back a few times to make sure i knew where i was in the narrative a really good book so glad that nanowrimo didn't wrestle this one out of my hands something about nanowrimo meant that all of the books i was waiting for arrived during november when i couldn't read them whoops","1189":"i liked the concept of this book we begin at the end of the story and read our way backwards but by the time i was done it didn't live up to my expectations the why wasn't really answered at least to me and then i ended up with more questions","1190":"quick read book is all about choices and their consequences one of the most original books i've read in awhile","1191":"how did this book get such good ratings review to come later","1192":"the beginning of this book was a bit cryptic and confusing but once i got into it i understood what a unique way of telling a story i also appreciated reading about how thoughtfully he worked in his business","1193":"i love the mountain goats and it was cool to see the themes he visits in songs come through in wolf in white van visions of destruction fondness for freaks a healthy love of black metal etc i'm not sure if the reverse chronology is necessary but that's maybe just a personal thing i'd kind of like to read it again in reverse order and see if i like it better i blew through it in a few days edit upgraded to 5 stars i've been thinking about this book pretty much every day since i read it","1194":"meh maybe you have to be a gen x guy to really appreciate this the writing was fine but the personality of the narrator and his obsession with a d u0026amp d like game of his own creation did not particularly pull me in to the story","1195":" compelling and unsettling this book asks big questions and refuses to answer them it's almost impossible to talk about it without spoiling anything to the point where i recommend you not read the blurb just read the book it's barely longer than a plot synopsis anyway and the blurb completely misses the point the bottom line is that good books are entertaining but great books make me uncomfortable i will wake up next week or next month wondering what i was supposed to learn from this one and what i might have missed sort of spoilers follow i was torn after i finished it part of me wanted to feel unsatisfied because darnielle flatly refuses to tie up his narrative into a neat package that makes sense the central mystery goes essentially unsolved why do people do the things they do but the more i think about it the more i appreciate that in the real world events are often senseless even the actors sometimes do not and cannot know why they do things why in the infinitely branching tree of choices they took this path and abandoned another forever","1196":"john darnielle's launch into non song fiction was for the most part successful he creates an interwoven story line with a troubled narrator and his created choose your own adventure mail in game it was written well which should go without saying for darnielle is a tremendous writer who employs the successful use of figurative language in his pieces however i found the story sometimes difficult to follow for it followed glimpses into the narrator's life and thus the character development seemed a bit too haphazard for example the injury sustained by the narrator while we know what caused it is not fully reasoned for the reader and that was needed a bit more","1197":"like nothing i have ever read before amazing lyrical haunting and well structured","1198":"the last third of the book was the most compelling i'll have to brush up on my conan reading","1199":"i wasn't sure what to expect from the debut novel of musician john darnielle whose band the mountain goats is beloved by tons of my friends i'm now going to have to put him in the camp of creative people who are good at more than one thing because this book is a keeper the movement between the past and the present and the real and fictional lives of the main character is smooth and suits the story which is both expansive and small no easy answers or pat conclusions just good writing and deep characters","1200":"something about this book so quintessentially captures gaming culture without talking about games and i think that's pretty special it's put together like an enormous spiral and a few chapters in you know exactly what the book's going to end with really you know just by reading the blurb the blurb gives away a lot but you can't stop reading beautifully written","1201":"phenomenal","1202":"not surprisingly given darnielle's fabulous lyrics for the mountain goats his novel is full of beautiful sentences and images the protagonist was a nerd and loner in late 80s early 90s high school the kind of kid that played du0026amp d and read scifi and listened to heavy metal not someone i necessarily understand i don't feel as if i understand a whole lot better at the end of this novel but i don't think that was the point the character doesn't understand either what happens to him i do think however that i won't easily forget sean phillips","1203":"it was questionable for me i went from liking it to being able to put it down and forgetting about it several times it was the last chapter that sold it for me","1204":" john darnielle is one of the most talented working songwriters today but i didn't imagine that his gift crossed over to works of fiction although i should have guessed wolf in white van is a slim but taxing read that i would not at all recommend for a bit of light reading i would however recommend it to anyone willing to dive into the effects of severe depression trauma and the imagined worlds we create to escape and make sense of both fans of 1980s fantasy films pulp adventure novels and role playing games will also find plenty to gravitate toward but be warned this is not a piece of feel good nostalgia sean the book's protagonist lives a secluded life after a vaguely recounted accident mars his teenage years he finds solace in a mail in rpg he creates and administers to a handful of fans what follows is an intense deconstruction of both his life and the lives of the people he touches whether in person or as part of his mail correspondences i won't give spoilers beyond that this book is best experienced with little to no preamble be sure to bring a box of tissues and an iron constitution 4 2 5","1205":"very disturbing story of a teen that atempts sucidie and the aftermath and consequence of his actions","1206":"i'm driving from chicago to st louis falling southward on a six hour stretch of a lonely highway seeing nothing that leaves any lasting impression on the flat trip through countless fields that lead back to my hometown i pass a slow moving truck and then quickly weave around another vehicle that loiters absentmindedly in the fast lane my mind activates and i'm somewhere else i'm the favorite to win a nationally televised championship race in a make believe sporting league of competitive recreational driving i speed up to squeeze between a suv and an oncoming truck and the announcers breathlessly communicate it to a worldwide audience of enraptured onlookers kozak again showing his artistry as he applies just the right amount of speed to pull that maneuver off you're absolutely right jim he stays just under the legally acceptable speed limit preventing the 20 second penalty he's on pace for a record time my turn angles are precise i use my turn signal to prevent further time runoffs i grip the steering wheel tightly and can see the line i need to take as it plots out in my mind 100 yards

on the couch staring at the piano in the corner of my apartment tumbleweeds of dust gather around the floor underneath it the keys are dirty and cold it seems a lifetime ago when i practiced daily for hours mastering the masters realizing a potential that was limitless my mind stands up i play for an hour laughing to myself as i stretch my out of shape wrists and fingers i do the same the next day and begin to get frustrated at a book of speed exercises at the top of the page my old piano teacher had written the date that i'd previously completed the exercise 1996 almost 20 years ago i get angry and play them again and again for hours on end until i can do it with my eyes closed i sleep so well that night i begin to think of rhythms notes melodies while at work my mind struggling to contain this new exciting influx of ideas i stay up all night not even noticing the sun coming up and finish recoding a rough track of an original song eventually i save enough money to rent some studio space and record a short album thinking nothing of it i post it on my social websites and feel pride as my friends exclaim their surprise and approval the songs get shared and i'm encouraged to play some shows which eventually builds a following of people who would pay money to see me play i smile and shake my head in bewilderment as i tell my boss i have to quit and that i know it's not a smart move to go on the road as a 30 year old musician but it's something i've wanted to do my entire life the credits begin to roll and i am surprised that the movie i was watching is now over i

both outside and on the faces of the other passengers at the next stop the door opens and an indescribably beautiful woman enters her eyes pointed down and mannerisms betraying a reluctance to start the day but still with an aura of warmth and energy my mind lights up we get off at the same stop she says thank you as i hold a door open for her and we inexplicably start talking it's clear how much we have in common how we genuinely laugh at each others easy jokes how we smile at each other with our eyes she finally says well i work over here with that terrifying ellipses at the end of her words i take a chance and just manage to avoid tripping over my words enough to ask if she would like to go out some time against all odds against all belief she accepts our first meetings are coy then captivating finally carefree all cynicism is washed away and the question of whether i would ever find love finally after starting to really believe it would never happen again is answered with a resounding yes our wedding is small and surrounded with friends who have wanted nothing more than this for me for us forever our children make us proud and we live out our lives in comfort and clarity the words on the tombstone over our shared grave slowly blur over time the words on the page in the book i'm holding have blurred i've been staring at them without reading i look up and am surprised that i'm almost to my stop the woman is gone she must've gotten off at an earlier stop and i never see her again _________________________________this is a book for people who create universes in their head to escape the one they're living in it is written in a beautiful almost poetic language and is very sad the synopsis may sound silly with talk of role playing games and such nerdery but it is a very poignant study of someone who is living with a deformity hiding in isolation escaping reality the only way he can think of there is a plot and a kind of mystery and an ending that could prove frustrating if you are the type of person who needs closure but the beauty of this book is in how darnielle creates a compelling argument for escape while simultaneously showing the danger of what it can bring this was a complete unexpected delightful surprise","1207":"this book was so interesting and a real page turner","1208":"too much work to stay engaged ended up skimming so that i at least got the jest of the story","1209":"i had high hopes for this book but it was a stretch many people said many good things about it but i felt it dragged on for too long and had details that were seemingly unnecessary oh well book is done on to the next","1210":"this is one of those books that i won't be able to review properly i already adore the mountain goats and john darnielle so there's my bias after reading i'm left a bit like i am after a murakami novel full of questions and emotion i feel like there's so much bubbling under the surface and i know this will be reread in the future if you need books to be clear and precise with things laid out neatly this isn't the novel for you","1211":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book gets 5 stars simply because of engulfing the writing is i couldn't put it down and not because it's so action packed and intense but because i was in sean's head and invested however i finished this book with quite a bit of confusion i'm wondering if that was intended because of his brain injury he stated more than once he gets facts mixed up when he remembers things i had thought the accident was truly and accident when he was like 11 then he overdosed at age 17 i guess tha this book gets 5 stars simply because of engulfing the writing is i couldn't put it down and not because it's so action packed and intense but because i was in sean's head and invested however i finished this book with quite a bit of confusion i'm wondering if that was intended because of his brain injury he stated more than once he gets facts mixed up when he remembers things i had thought the accident was truly and accident when he was like 11 then he overdosed at age 17 i guess that's not true the biggest confusion was why why did he do it i mean i know his head was disturbed but he stated he loved his life then he goes and fingers a girl he likes then comes home contemplates killing his parents but settles for suicide if anyone reads this and saw answers to these feel free to enlighten me more","1212":"totally biased since the author is also my favorite songwriter and yet in what's essentially a story of loneliness and darkness there are moments of beauty little connections that bring rays of light and a deep understanding that sadness isn't as simple as we wish it was simple moving a little scary and very honest","1213":"beautifully written i mean its john darnielle what do you expect but often hard to keep attention to and very description heavy and difficult to read still very great i'll probably read it again at a later date just to catch details i missed","1214":"wolf in white van has already cemented it's place as #1 book i have read this year it's a short yet brutal book the kind of writing you would expect from john darnielle","1215":"much like john darniell's song lyrics his prose is thoughtful and deep the premise for the story is an interesting one and the way we dip into the world that was created by a misunderstood kid stuck in a hospital bed is interesting as the story is told in a sort of reverse order by the older version of that kid sean i wonder if darnielle writes another novel if we'll get to visit more about the trace italian","1216":"saying i 'enjoyed' this book would be the wrong way to put it i read it and i felt it it was written really well even with the different timelines i very rarely got confused the imagery was vivid even though it was very dated i trusted in it i would believe this as non fiction if no one told me it wasn't read the full review on my blog","1217":"what happens when a creative teen is left alone with his thoughts while he recovers from a head injury well this kid writes a game pre online maybe if i played strategy games i would appreciate this more it was just all so tragic humorless lonely the tone was stable throughout depressing like living in oregon a little sunshine peaking through the clouds would have been nice","1218":"weird smart dark and comical i expected nothing less from mr darnielle i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book","1219":"i recently finished reading wolf in white van for the second time that is as a graduate student with a job internship frequently ignored friends and family and very little time to read books of my choosing in part i think the hope was that after the second time around i would have a better grasp on how to adequately describe exactly what it is i love about john darnielle writing and the story he tells what the emotionally charged often expansive feeling experience was for me and why... and maybe piece together all the theories and themes and thoughts that circle around in my head and occupy the tabbed margin notes in my copy through the process of reading it but maybe the paper i just finished writing extracted all the well structured sentences from my brain or maybe part of me thinks that those things that i found so satisfying about the book are things best left for the reader to discover rather than through whatever rehashing i may be able to offer either way... maybe someday i'll be able to articulate the things i hoped to but for now i'll just say the very true and perhaps obvious it's beautifully written and i highly recommend it","1220":" this book never really brings clarity to the characters connected to the narrator sean his parents' emotions and reasoning are kept so clouded that you're only ever close enough to sean to gather a sense of depth or the intimacy that the sensitive subject matter asks of the reader yes the book gets a little deeper than fun snail mail universes the reader ultimately ends up no more than a gawking passerby with few lessons learned if one is to seek to scrape any meaning from this novels tale the 'whys ' of teenage dom end up feeling very heavy shrouded in ambiguity without the resolution or answering to any element of sean's life","1221":"really interesting main character as always with john d beautiful turns of phrase and excellent use of language wish more had happened plot wise but i will be digesting this for a while and i think that's a sign of a good read","1222":"short lyrical account of the rich fantasies that live within us very human darnielle does a fantastic job managing sentiment and presenting as is sometimes i have trouble finding the edges","1223":" i loved the idea of the game darnielle's prose was strong as expected the character was interesting so why am i ambivalent about this novel i guess it suffered in part for my having read it after david mitchell's powerful the bone clocks and while the non linear structure was well managed it defeated itself by the climax of the book i already knew everything i had wanted to know all the tension of the early chapters had long since dissolved i would have liked a little more about the game and lance and carrie as well oh points for the sf references within the book i liked having a lit fic protagonist whose cultural touchstones were f u0026amp sf and omni and conan","1224":"sean phillips is the creator of trace italian a role playing game done through the mail it's similar to a pick your own adventure book players receive a letter from sean containing the results of their last move and they mail him back their next move this isolated way of making a living suits sean who was horribly disfigured in an accident revealed to the reader bit by bit through the course of the book a story told in reverse we start from the present and wind slowly backward learning more about sean's childhood his family his friends at school and the accident that left his life forever changed sean is a complex character--at times very lucid and insightful and meandering and unpredictable at others he's a true loner someone very comfortable with his own existence but wary of interactions with others though his longing for companionship and friendship can come through in heart breaking threads both past and present it's a strange book but not an unpleasant one i feel like i need to reread it to pick up things i may have missed the first time around it's one big puzzle--not unlike the game sean created","1225":" the best way i can explain to you how i think about this book is to ask you to remember a time when you did something terrible as a teenager a bad decision you made or a bad set of mind that you hardly recognize now as your own a short survey of my own mind suggests that these instances jump readily to hand and imagine that you had to live and are still currently living with a reminder of that time and that mindset and that decision not just a tattoo of a star that you got when you were drunk and now find meaningless and a little embarrassing but a big inescapable reminder that indicates to everyone who meets you now who you once were a tattoo that blatantly identifies you as part of a gang keloid scars on your arms from where you used to cut yourself sean phillips the narrator of wolf in white van carries an unavoidable reminder of the worst day of his life but doesn't seem to remember or be able to explain what his mind was like on that day the majority of the novel hints at what happened to sean explaining it in piecemeal up until the last chapter but i don't think it's necessary to keep it a secret sean shot himself attempting to kill himself but didn't succeed instead he destroyed most of his face went through an extensive surgical reconstruction and now lives alone on insurance payouts and a small amount of income he makes from running roleplaying games through the mail sean can't really explain why he did what he did and even the narrative of events from his day illustrates the inexplicable nature of some teenage suicides he talked with friends did some homework listened to music and then at night took a gun out from under his bed and walked to his parents' room thinking of shooting them before shooting himself i didn't know why sean thought about killing his parents nothing about him made him seem like that kind of kid to me but then he doesn't seem to understand it now himself and feels remorse for the way his actions affected his parents his parents hadn't really done anything to upset him he hadn't really done anything to upset himself it was as though an idea just slipped into his mind and stayed there until it was the only one left subliminal messages pop up multiple places in the novel the title is a reference to lyrics people thought they heard when they played rock and roll tapes backwards and throughout sean's role playing game characters are supposed to pick up on subtle clues to propel them toward the center of the game a partially underground fortress in the midwest called the trace italian as someone who has never gotten into role playing games and certainly without the patience to play one by mail i found the conceit of trace italian a little mystifying it's maybe a less social version of dungeons and dragons in that you can play it by yourself without speaking to anyone else the idea that two players also teenagers would start to believe the game was real to the extent that they traveled to the midwest and tried to literally perform their most recent move was implausible to me i guess the kids could have been on hallucinogens they could have been a bit mentally unstable i get the feeling we're supposed to view their accident one freezes to death the other is seriously injured as analogous to sean's it wasn't the fault of the metal music sean listened to or the role playing game the kids played it was just an idea in their still forming teenage brains that wasn't fully evaluated their responsibility circuits weren't entirely on yet and while some of us rode out that part of adolescence saying stupid things to boys or writing terrible fan fiction on the internet or drinking illicit beers or shoplifting chapstick these kids made a decision that could have cost them all their lives we're not supposed to really feel sorry for sean the accident and its outcome transformed his obsession with mythical fights and quests and conan into a detailed creative undertaking and a mildly successful entrepreneurial venture sean survived and is as much of an adult as his circumstances allow him to be in a transparent nod to the habits of childhood he still eats candy but is embarrassed by it and hides it from his assistant he has empathy for people who remind him of his old self both the kids who freeze themselves trying to follow the map of his game and the stoners outside the liquor store who ask him about his face but he is never going to be that person again and won't pretend to be wolf in white van might be a morose type of coming of age story rather than getting through a sadistic boarding school or running away or moving to a new country sean physically transforms himself he destroys his present trajectory for one a lot darker but in doing so crosses permanently over a barrier into adulthood in his game you can't go back to a save point to replay your turns and you wouldn't necessarily want to many roads lead to the trace italian and you don't have to win your first battle to get there","1226":"this book is so good i'm glad the errors in my advance copy justify buying and thus reading a second proper one","1227":" do you want a story where everything makes sense do you like neatly connected narrative logic do like likable reliable narrators if so this story is probably not for you i liked the author's willingness not to be formulaic i enjoyed the journey down meandering paths that take the readers to kooky 1980s outposts of pulp fiction novels and christian tv and backward masking and mail order gaming and then there is the sideways approach to the existential question of absurdity and meaning c'est fantastique the whys and wherefores that led our narrator to take the action that would radically transform him both physically and psychologically kept my interest to the very end but i think overall this book falls just short of being really good i liked it but i didn't love it it fascinated me but it didn't really move me though it almost did but it made me think and i do like that this is a very talented writer and this is a wonderful first effort he asks hard questions or more aptly he dances around them he doesn't give any answers which some readers won't like but i did","1228":"i loved reading this the first chapter was a little disorienting but after that it was a wild ride through the end of the book great writing about someone coping with chronic injury but also so much more than that","1229":" this book was interesting but i don't think it fit my reading style i tend to read before i go to bed and many nights i'd pick up the book to start a new chapter only to have to go back a few pages to remember what was going on i think this happened because of the book's backwards time line and that the narrator sean would narrate passages during the present time of the chapter then also recollect events from the past i also found sean's narration of real world events would mix with his trace italian world or conan world ideas and this often caused me to lose focus of the narration and i'd have to back a few lines to understand what was happening this is certainly and interesting book if you are looking for an unconventional weird character or if you want to read a story with a different type of story arch it's a bit more challenging than a traditional bed time novel","1230":"an amazing book once you have finished it you want to read it again and again and again","1231":"cool book about a teen and his attempt to fight his isolation by creating a role playing game for others i just wanted more from the book it had such awesome potential with the other characters and the trace italian the game he created but it is all pretty surface still an interesting read","1232":"this book feels like home in many different ways","1233":"it's hard to put my thoughts in order on this one i loved it the end was abrupt and shocking the game the world building amazing i definitely would have subscribed to his adventure i loved the writing and the narration sean's voice felt unique to me i loved the little lines of brilliance and information i hung on every page and read this all in one sitting loved it","1234":"very mixed feelings about this book 3 5","1235":"and so i thought about what was important to me about how i would want to be remembered about the totality of my vision realizing itself now under the heavy pressure of the movement but remaining true still true to the impermeable solitude of its origins","1236":"i just finished reading this and i feel like i need to immediately reread it so that i can understand what happened but i also never want to read it again because i feel so dark and depressed after finishing it both well written and confusing at the same time","1237":"i found this book to be something between weird and boring which furthers my image of a bunch of hipsters and genxers sitting around a coffee shop waxing nostalgic about the 90s and how 'meta' this book was in a nutshell this book was about a twisted kid who becomes a pathetic adult but is so much more than that because he has deep thoughts and beliefs right everyone is a beautiful unique snowflake two stars because it wasn't horribly written written to be made into a movie or tv show and thankfully erred on side of brevity at 200 pages","1238":"frank frazetta would dig this one","1239":" all book reviews are subjective but wolf in white van is more ymmv than most it hit me where i lived it was amazing important things to know 1 it's not really about trace italian the alternate reality game sean invents there's just enough about the game and its players and the deaths noted on the back copy to cast light on sean also to make the reader really want to play trace italian 2 this is not a book that gives you answers view spoiler you never find out why sean tried to commit suicide when sean says he doesn't know that's as much explanation as you're getting it isn't that kind of book you get the theories of his parents about why but in the moment itself there is no explanation shit just happens the moral of the book shit just happens and you have to create your own meaning through the stories that you tell hide spoiler so if that's a dealbreaker for you it might be really frustrating","1240":"very interesting","1241":" i only recently came upon john darnielle and the mountain goats in a wonderful npr 'fresh air' interview he did with host terry gross http www npr org 2014 09 17 3487361 what a real voice a thoughtful take on life humility humanity anyone who listens to this interview will want more like any great poet darnielle distills stories and for 'stories' in his musical life read 'songs' down to their essence less is so much more the first mountain goats album i bought 'all hail west texas' is an epitome of such boiling down you don't need a motorcycle driving wife or football hero gone bad acquaintance or any personal narrative that begins 'after three nights in jail ' to feel the pull of familiarity but you interject elmwood what about the book fair enough the writing is amazing and concentrated and deep right from page 1 and that is how it lost me too much of a focused voice too densely packed your mileage may vary but i found my tired self skimming toward the end perhaps a book deserving of more effort it just did not pull me like my new tmg album does","1242":" forever is a question you start asking when you look at the ceiling it becomes a word you hear in the same way that people who associate sound with color might hear a flat sky blue in the answerless nightlight of his grandmother's ghostly tv he has a too late static awakening nightly hauntings of something coming over him from outside or is it inside in speechless answers he's condemned to a life of never meeting his eyes people hide behind rehearsal time smiles the real world sean blew his face off and the look back is ghastly joker smile to his parents i can't really imagine the holes in his cheeks i wait for the film scare like in pirates of the caribbean and get the sad knowledge of granted actions forbidden to him no answers no bridges and too late before the accident and the is it inside or outside savior of his mind slide back to before saving is a crawl and inexplicable happiness welling up i feel like the saving is the same feeling as when he was dying the happiness is as the great unknown any why could be i have had this feeling that crawling out of the hole you dig for yourself is too hard to not stop before you're all the way out i call it wanting to feel like the real me with a back burn i can't shake off that another reason exists of feeling close to the whys why would you do that terrible self destructive thing i don't know i couldn't tell you no meeting of eyes the real you does the savior thing that just means you didn't feel any of it was worth it i think sean would say something amazing about not turning to the path to get the hell out stay around and find out what all of the shadows on the wall look like what could you scare yourself into thinking they look like when the lights are going out the real world doors of insurance papers and thank god waking up to not being welcome at home anymore so he lives through the obliteration of old sean he can't exist ever again he's buried in stone cold i wish it had never happened and i can't imagine that it never did grief he would have to kill who he is now to do it why did he try to do it before he doesn't know and i believe him the in between sean has to do the reality so he invents his first game the trace italian one of those mysterious fantasy magazine write in ads you might glance at maybe like a fantasy cover of a book you never get around to reading but you are reminded of it if you ever tried to recreate a favorite story and probably badly ripped something off but you could trick yourself into a fever of your creation i did that forever i'll like the stupidest stuff if it reminds me of the crap i sustained myself with because i get that feeling back when sean says that the trace italian is where people like him could be safe i felt included i wanted to write in and make choose your adventure moves and wait for the mail to get the next turn the kind of heroism you can only believe in by your own grace the kind you can't promise yourself you'll have i didn't wonder that someday maybe now no one plays trace italian anymore the real world returns and another way to pay the bills will have to be found these were his only sort of graced friends these players two kids have their power from invisible sources her parents blame sean and trace italian the game made them take it too seriously it was proof in their paths what made them not know that kansas nights can be so cold in his letter read to carrie's parents in trial sean cannot leave out that their move was the correct one their pull in his ghosts is undeniable in another player chris who quits on his own terms i wanted to stay where he was when he gave up not being able to sleep at night because he could see the bodies in the trace sean could see their moves whenever he's back then or now whichever is which of the real world or letting go i cannot help wanting both to be the sean that had to have the trace a companion he calls marco and grafted out of those magic where did they come from impressions it's all true they cannot come from just you and it's a horrifying feeling of being both alone and never alone to know it of course no one could have made sean make a monster out of himself there may as well be a time lock like out of doctor who you can't return to when you did it and know yourself what he can do is make wordless soul movements that stop before they can end when those kids could have made him their unexplainable it felt so real me in the before the since the after and the yawning future the way it traces that is it you or is it the world where does it come from this book is so perfect i can't stand it i wish that i was still reading wolf in white van i could see in my mind's eye that i can't always get out of the way leaning on it in dark impulses warm ones too i kind of wish that i was all of them and i'd be able to step outside and reach the future and the end i thought about the guy in the truck the focus in his expression and i felt like i already knew enough of the story to tell it to somebody else maybe better than either of its major players could","1243":"i feel like i missed something this book just wasn't very interesting to me and i never did care enough i couldn't tell if the point was about the main character's current life his accident when he was a teen the kids who got hurt playing his role play game via the mail just very scattered for a 224 page book","1244":"i wasn't sure whether to give it 4 or 5 stars but i'm feeling generous today so it gets a perfect score by me i knew nothing about the plot going into it honestly i'd been trying to avoid the book thinking c'mon mountain goats man you can't be that talented save some for the rest of us but anyway not having read the book flap or anything made the first few chapters almost incomprehensible in a really fantastic way though the first person narrative was mildly irritating at first i don't think this particular story could have been told any other way i loved it protag sean will stay with me for a long time","1245":"i'm not sure that this is meant to be a book that one loves or hates there is very little in the way of action this is more of a thinking person's book questions are asked but rarely answered there is no great resolution or even any understanding of events but none of it matters because so much of it thought provoking and atmospheric","1246":" reminded me a lot of remainder another short book about a man's circular obsessions and isolation after a catastrophe that leaves him with a lot of time on his hands and little connection to the outside world i enjoy john darnielle's prose writing style just as i enjoy his music with mountain goats but this felt a little scattershot to me a bunch of ideas in search of a theme or meaning that seems to be very deliberate--the idea of circling a point conversationally without ever getting there comes up a couple of times within the book and the protagonist's main occupation is a play by mail role playing game he designed to be nigh endless with no one ever reaching the theoretical final stages it feels like this book is in a way about aimlessness and lack of satisfaction about how life drones on without simple narrative answers no matter what you do but making that into a motif doesn't make it any more satisfying especially at the rather abrupt end which leaves some things unsaid that could really have stood to be said","1247":"i liked a lot of this but i found it ultimately unsatisfying","1248":"strange i understood the jumping around in time and to various scenarios i got the interior life and the fact that a text adventure game would be similar in that choices we make lead to consequences but overall i came away dissatisfied i did not like the protagonist despite his internal honesty and rigour","1249":"i gotta admit i just don't see how this is getting all the hype it did","1250":"damn good piece of writing","1251":" is this a convincing evocation of the life of a teenage boy who disfigures himself and lives yes did i ever doubt while i was reading it that a mind so instinctively preoccupied with and tantalized by violent death could exist no so in many ways this novel does what novels should do it asks where evil comes from and why we make such awful mistakes in this case evil comes from within and the awful mistake is inevitable there's no epiphany about how it could have been prevented because sean's death wish is innate i suppose you could argue that i don't like the novel because that's not the answer i want to hear true but i don't think a novel should be an existential dead end it's an art form and as such it has to do more than mirror reality the purpose of art is to make you feel that something comes of the suffering that now we know something we didn't know and we are purified somehow not just by the beauty of the prose but by the epiphanies of the narrator i'm not going to say this is a bad book but i will say that it is the darkest most nihilistic book i've ever read and it strengthens every fear i've ever had about the power of gaming to destroy lives","1252":"beautiful language interesting protagonist boring plot","1253":" i really really enjoyed this book a lot it was hard to read for a lot of reasons it definitely hit me personally being a nerd someone who identifies a lot with imagining a better world for myself and being miserable with the one i'm in etc etc the writing was goddamned beautiful sometimes it takes depression to know depression and that might explain why some reviewers were bored reading it every last detail in the book made sense to me and i think darnielle did a fantastic job creating a really believable protagonist but if you've never felt so painfully disconnected to the world the book might not click with you that being said i think everyone feels that way at times and i think a lot of people just block out the memory of it or are in denial and as a side note i've never listened to his band but this book made me want to read his lyrics at the least he's one hell of a goddamn writer wolf in white van is the exact kind of book i wish i would write and it's inspired me to continue to try and do so","1254":"i'd give this one 2 5 stars mainly for such an out of the box concept and making you think twice about you interact with someone that has a disfigurement beyond that the book wasn't at all what i thought it was going to be from the description i thought we were going to exploring a game not exploring the after effects of a life changing action of a 17 year old i'm also a big fan of why i want to know why someone might put a rifle in their own face but there is no why it's like the french it just happens and that's the way it is these types of books ultimately leave me flat i'm just not angsty enough to get it","1255":"what a marvelous little book you can get mad at him now for being a great songwriter and a real deal novelist","1256":"it is a peculiar feeling to finish a book and simultaneously desire to re read it instantly and never touch it again layered complex beautiful and weirdly true to a portion of the human psyche that is not often explored with such honesty and empathy this is raw stuff and without question a brilliant debut by darnielle this isn't just a book written by a musician instead it is a mesmerizing work from a new novelist who takes his craft seriously","1257":"huh to sum it up i don't see what all the fuss had been about prose wise the book was well written i gotta take points off for structure however because the narrative jumps around between different time periods very often typically without any cues e g visual markings separating the changing paragraphs i caught myself many times having to stop and reorient things so i knew what was going on it's a short book but took me an inordinate amount of time to finish because of this i liken it to watching a movie like memento you really gotta be paying attention and stay focused to get the most out of it but hey maybe i just didn't get it i didn't relate to the motivations that the characters seemed to be expressing but then again i haven't been through those types of traumatic experiences either many of the previous reviews talked about needing to take a moment after finishing to absorb the profoundness this book laid on them all i wanted to do was move on to the next read and leave this one behind on the positive side the imagery and descriptions that the book presented were great save for one thing i could definitely picture the trace and the world but couldn't really get a good mental picture of sean's deformity so i just ended up picturing him as sloth from the goonies all in all not upset that i read it but glad it was a library read and not a purchase","1258":"this book explores themes of belonging u0026amp exclusion adolescence u0026amp adulthood suicide u0026amp survival it's a slice of life story that everyone can relate to although sean has been in very specific circumstances although it has relatable themes it's not a book i'd recommend to everyone depending on their taste this book will make you feel things deeply and contemplate your own life","1259":"but people underestimate just how starved everybody is for some magic pathway back into childhood in video games you sometimes run into what they call a side quest and if you don't manage to figure it out you can usually just go back into the normal world of the game and continue on toward your objective i felt like i couldn't find my way back to the world now like i was somebody locked in a meaningless side quest in a stuck screen","1260":"an interesting look into the mind of a very isolated introspective character secluded by depression a long hospital stay and a shocking physical appearance the protagonist creates a fantasy world of his own that becomes a popular game through his game correspondence he is able to feel a connection with people he'd otherwise never experience there are some interesting stylistic choices the book reads in a reverse chronology which serves as both a call out to paranoia over back masking satanic messages in rock music as well as a way to build up to the most pivotal moment in the book which is the earliest in the timeline not compelling to me but certainly worth a read","1261":"this might simply be the most frightening book i've ever read not vampires and ghouls frightening more of a deep down dread in the pits of my soul","1262":"i put off actually reading this for a long time because i figured i wouldn't want it to end and i was right wow what a good book","1263":"this was a weird and wordsy novel but it had a lot of heart and a great mystery the kind of book that feels like life is where not everything gets finished and wrapped up in a little bow it leaves you thinking once you've finished it","1264":" i'm really not sure what to say about this book at first i had a hard time keeping track of what was going on because sean's narration isn't exactly linear this is normally not too much of a problem but for a while i think ere were like four timelines intermingling there's the present narrative where he recalls things from the past in a single current moment there are moments he's purely imagining scenarios in the present there are flashbacks to past events and flashbacks of things he imagined not to mention the story is working backwards towards an event to begin with it just took some getting used to i must say sean is one of the most imaginative characters i've ever been introduced to the complexity of his character and mental state was well reflected in the writing style the story was so different from anything i normally read it was interesting to read such an introspective book and not have it all tied up in a neat little bow at the end","1265":"one of the most devastatingly beautiful and intense books i've ever read gorgeous prose following the tragic imaginative haunting empathetic and captivating narrator sean phillips as he chronicles his life disfigured but creative and curious easily one of my new favorite books can't say enough good things","1266":" wolf in white van is an interesting slim novel i really liked the writing style of the author i wasn't aware when i picked up this book that the writer is also the the songwriter for the mountain goats but it makes sense because his writing style is poetic in parts wolf in white van tells the story of a young man with a horrifying facial deformity that causes him to go into hiding he makes his living by mailing out game moves to paying subscribers of his game trace italian it is a post apocalyptic scenario where he sets the scene and the players write their moves to him and he sends them back pre written outcomes he has made the game complex enough that no one has ever finished and in all likelihood no one ever will he gives the players hope though i was intrigued by the plot point that the narrator was once normal looking and a tragic accident occurred where he is now living on the fringe of society with no friends and no hobbies outside of his game i kept reading to find out what happened to him i give it 3 stars because i wasn't fully satisfied by the conclusion to this mystery or the why behind it","1267":"gorgeous book my only criticism is that it ends 100 pages too soon i just finished it and can't stop thinking about it john darnielle's writing is poetic descriptive and evocative he explores the topics of loneliness u0026amp isolation familiar to nearly everyone who was ever a teenager his protagonist now an adult who created a role playing game in his late teen years is a sharp reflection of human pathos he has experienced tragedy while recovering from his tragedy he created a world of escapism which became the role playing game trace italian through trace italian others experience escape from their realities through this framework i believe darnielle explores themes of reality vs fantasy and specifically the balance where fantasy beings to overtake reality relative to trace italian as the fantasy he gives us the experiences of lance u0026amp carrie chris haynes and sean phillips creator of trace italian and protagonist each of these 3 groups have very different outcomes as a result of their level involvement in the fantasy all 3 experience it creeping into or overtaking their realities but react to it in different ways the conclusions are left for us to draw additionally sean from his early years up has been a fan of conan the barbarian krull and other fantasy fiction movies there are some looser ties of his own tragedy to these fantasies view spoiler he also talks about his tragedy in terms of a role playing game move as being one outcome of a hundred different paths he could have taken hide spoiler i am still working out in my head what this all means i also see themes of god vs the devil and faith vs skepticism being explored it's from a section on this theme where the book gets the title wolf in white van the phrase being the supposedly satanic back masking on a rock and roll album discussed by televangelists overall i loved the book i'm haunted by it i can't stop thinking about it and trying to draw connections and resolution in my own mind it is beautifully and powerfully written it is an accurate and authentic look inside the head of an outsider it may not be for everyone but for me it's one of the best books i've ever read","1268":"this book is difficult to rate i loved what was there but before i knew it the book was over plot threads were alluded to but never expounded upon felt like it should've been twice the length it felt like this was done purposely as the protagonist is purposely only telling the reader part of the story regardless it's frustrating when a good book ends when it's only getting started","1269":"i should have known this book would be so good sure it starts out a little slow we aren't given all of the details up front but the book unwinds and answers all of its questions well and tells a great story on the way the contrast between the narrator and his escapist game and the tragedy of his choices and l c blended together well and created a fascinating world the story is short and it takes a bit to get started but it's definitely worth the read","1270":" this book turned out to be far more introverted and reflective than i expected it to be which isn't at all bad but i think my false expectations were partly to blame on the inner flap summary which heavily focuses on the roles of lance and carrie and the dramatic dangerous actions they are driven to by sean's game and that's not really what the book's about at all rather it's an important but ultimately rather minimal piece of sean's experiences and inner turmoil which lie at the novel's real center sean is a richly and realistically drawn character and in writing from the perspective of someone who suffers a disfiguring and debilitating injury darnielle manages to avoid any tendencies to romanticize mock or pity sean's condition in his narrative tone which is very much appreciated i sympathized with the character greatly and was interested in seeing how the threads of his life's story wove together to explain his present situation i also found the whole idea of his game trace italian and the potential real life consequences for those players who get in too deep to be highly compelling and original still i felt a bit underwhelmed after finishing the last page like the story failed to sufficiently cohere or wasn't quite pushed as far as it could have gone part of this in my opinion is due to some first time novelist mistakes that darnielle makes namely relying too heavily on summary over scene and unnecessarily confusing the timeline another problem i think is the exclusive focus on sean as the really exciting bits seem to involve his players and their various takes on the game yet we never get to know them beyond fragments of their correspondences with sean and his imagined sense of who they are even the conflict with lance and carrie billed as such an important facet of the story is explained and done away with in a paragraph or two here and there scattered like afterthoughts throughout or maybe the problem is just with me expecting the book to be something that it wasn't perhaps i would find it more satisfying on a second reading still despite these complaints it was an enjoyable ride and there were a lot of parts i found highly gripping and provocative which is why i'm still willing to rate it quite highly darnielle clearly has promise as a novelist having already proven his talent as a songwriter so i'd be interested to read any of his future work if he decides to continue in this direction","1271":"john darnielle is every bit as good at writing to beautiful prose as he is and writing beautiful lyrics this book is great it let's you explore its depths and then puzzle over the finale after finishing it still leaving you with a feeling of closure i hope darnielle never stops writing music but i also hope there are more books like this to come","1272":"4 5 stars this book is brilliant the writing is superb story makes you think and think and think and think of it when you aren't even thinking of it give this one a try people","1273":" i don't quite know what to do with this book it's good it's very good it's a slow burn of a maze of a novel that reveals itself to you in fits and starts and layers it's engaging and troubling and puzzling and shocking you are at once fascinated by repulsed from sympathetic to and angry with the protagonist sean phillips the novel is fraught with parallels and the ramifications of choice and the ending is powerful enough that it makes you want to turn back to page one and re read it through the crimson hue of this new and terrifying lens","1274":"a great character study about the power of imagination and the stories we tell ourselves something like catcher in the rye but with a much much likeable protagonist","1275":"this is a book where a starred review is insufficient i love darnielle's writing but i just don't have any interest in rpgs and that made parts of this story a little tedious to me but the way he wrote certain interactions was beautiful and as one would expect from the frontman of the mountain goats suffused with radical empathy throughout i hope he writes another novel","1276":" i am a bit biased as this is a the second novel first read by my favorite singer songwriter the imminent despair of his songs is felt here but there is also a glimmer of hope spoilers even though it ends with a literal bang it also concludes with an emotional whimper a non conclusion regarding the what and how of the deeds of the protagonist but that is kind of the point not everything in life is explainable or has a reason to it the point that darnielle makes throughout the novel that there are no easy boundaries to what is evil good weird bad violent ugly beatiful and the human experience is not reducable to simple categories is also somehwat of a detriment to the book because it all moves towards an inconclusive but clearly thoughtout ending which is also beginning several passages of the book feel like stretches where darnielle goes to the motions moving along the machinations of the plot while not exactly pushing forward the emotional arc of sean the lead except for those 20 or so pages before the final three chapters it is an absolute riveting novel empathatic poetic beautifully structured","1277":"the plot was a bit hard for my brain to follow but settled a bit towards the end making it worth another read the writing matches his 33 1 3 entry but may not achieve the same impact as the best mountain goats lyrics due to the long format of the novel it's a good book for fans of john darnielle and nerdy fantasy weirdness","1278":"i still need some time to reflect on this one i think ominous to the end hmmmm","1279":"4 5 oh my god i've got chills all over","1280":" brilliant audio rendition by the author with perfect pacing and varied delivery and cool little distorted guitar chapter transitions darnielle's singing voice is far from my favorite but i remember thinking during his wtf episode that i could listen to him tell stories for hours so i did the novel itself succeeds and fails by the voice of its first person protagonist sean a man who traumatically left his adolescence into a world of extreme isolation in this life inside his head he's developed a sort of photographic imagination that many years after the debilitating incident he turns back onto his childhood to tell his life in flashback unfortunately as we travel back from sean's present day the wisdom and acceptance of his situation gives way to his confusion and rage as a kid the emotional arc of this reverse chronology is wholly accurate to how we feel about our misguided former selves but in otherwise engaging prose this regression can feel like the opposite of character development i also wanted to make some critical comment on how the book's slow reveal structure makes us expect but not find further traumas to reveal themselves with knowledge of the content of darnielle's life and songwriting we suspect perhaps some deeper hardship than suburban malaise and distant parenting that gave young misfit sean his cruel outlook but upon further reflection the bait and switch in that arena is in some senses intentional and well executed in line with the narrative's insistence against looking for logical reasons like an outside influence on a young person's troubles still sean's bitter young voice has a tone of perceived injustice more the product of fantastical male entitlement than growing up friendless see recent articles on nerds denying privilege http www newstatesman com laurie pe older sean and darnielle have both clearly grown out of those attitudes so their presence isn't really a mark against the book but they're no fun to read and unfortunately it's that utterly un self reflexive voice that ends the novel","1281":"interesting read but just good not great","1282":" normally i try pretty hard to not read anything in advance about a book before jumping in generally the only thing i know is that i saw it in a list and decided it was worth adding to my to read shelf i'm glad i read a spoiler review for this one otherwise i think i'd've been a bit disappointed my expectations would not have been met knowing what was and what wasn't to come i was able to settle into the character and feel for him and with him and that made the time spent very satisfying","1283":"i won this book through goodreads first reads4 5masterfully constructed darnielle tricks the reader into believing ends without means intentions without motives 'wolf in white van' constructs character through numerous sub stories and recounts creating an ever more approachable and empathetic hero but it is within the last pieces that his deception becomes apparent and we are forced to question the mind space we have entered the applicability of 'hero'","1284":"very interesting uniquely written story","1285":"4 5 actually and jeeeeeeezus","1286":"a dark book left me cold but maybe that was the point","1287":" somewhere in the 4 5 range i'll decide where before the end probably so if you haven't read this yet i can assume one of two things either a you are not a fan of the mountain goats awww or b you are waiting for me to finish so that you can read it on my kindle sorry scarlett if you are a fan and have not read this and are not scarlett read this now it's not that long i'll wait at which point i pretty much have to give it 5 stars i guess anyway some thoughts unsurprisingly there are several turns of phrase that could be taken from any of a hundred or so of darnielle's songs if you're in camp a above i should mention that this number is not an exaggeration and is probably underestimated which is to say that they convey sort of the world ending drama of seemingly commonplace things and experiences i've always felt that one of his greatest gifts as a writer is his ability to take very specific circumstances and make them real and relatable and important and then also to elevate them and give them dignity if you've lived through such circumstances there's a tendency to latch on and never let go but even if you haven't 3 minutes and 4 or these days a few more chords later you'll feel as though you have or at least that you can understand those who have a little better maybe ok bye","1288":"super good reminded me a lot of the stranger but i didn't like the stranger as much as this","1289":"i really enjoyed the style of writing and pacing as the novel moving from present day to the end but i felt the ending was too abrupt and there were several loose ends that i wish were continued and tied up otherwise pleasantly surprised that josh darnielle is as talented a writer as as a musician","1290":" god no wonder this was long listed for the national book award 2014 this story this writing is achingly good and i mean that unbelievably literally as i read darnielle's exquisitely crafted sentences and thoughts i felt a tightness in the center of my chest and my brows painfully knitted together i was compelled to feel both miserable and elated at the same time to be both baffled by the character and feel an absolute and implicit understanding of him this is a novel but everything in it feels so transcendentally true that it approaches a realism beyond what we usually see and hear it is about what we feel and don't even realize that we feel darnielle expertly weaves the fantasy in our minds with the harsh reality of the decisions we make in the real world and leaves you pondering your own sanity in the process","1291":" i had read such great reviews for this book but i had to force myself to finish it it is the story of a young man with a mental illness and the consequences of coping with this in his life his thoughts his medications his caretakers his actions it was very disjointed and although the writing was beautiful at times i did not develop enough empathy for any of the characters to want to continue reading the reveals in plot are gradual and the structure of the book going back and forth in time leading up to the defining incident at the end was honestly kind of anti climatic and frustrating to me but if you ever want to read what might be happening in the mind of an unstable person this book could be enlightening for example i get the joke now but then it was completely meaningless to me it could have been in some foreign alphabet except it wasn't i understood all the words but together in that sequence with that picture to my mind they were chaos and so in a different way were ray's musings his helpful admonishments and his stern encouragements they tried to reach across a divide whose distance he couldn't accurately gauge depressing stuff for a slim novel it took me a longer than usual time to finish 1 5 2 rating","1292":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really loved darnielle's depiction of the protagonist sean's mental life is told in a reversed chronological order starting from his maturity and going back towards his adolescence i find that the attempted suicide was consequential to his panic for the future a refusal to conform to the dominant way we live our lives school u0026gt college u0026gt decent job u0026gt family with it comes the loss of our passion of our most visceral interests and inclinations sean didn't want that and i really loved darnielle's depiction of the protagonist sean's mental life is told in a reversed chronological order starting from his maturity and going back towards his adolescence i find

comes the loss of our passion of our most visceral interests and inclinations sean didn't want that and in one way or another he gets what he wanted his life after he gets better won't be conventional or normal he sort of breaks the mold because his monstrous appearance sets him out of the conventional path to adulthood i loved to read his story so genuine and true and obscure more","1293":"too serious for an airport read","1294":"i think if i had read this myself instead of listening to the audiobook it might have 4 stars i try not to let bad narrator color my judgment too much but ooof he was a bad narrator","1295":"absolutely incredible sincerely recommend picking up the audiobook to hear the man himself reading it a simple quiet fury to his writing that made this book not quite like anything else a wonderful blunt beauty","1296":"the book was well written an unusual story and characters and if i liked the story i would have given it 5 starts i was not the right target audience","1297":" more like 3 5 stars the material is dark the structure of the novel and its themes come together in a beautiful way the text based game is fascinating it's 3 stars instead of 4 because it doesn't go as deep as i'd like into the protagonist's psyche also maybe because i have adolescent depression suicide fatigue after reading the bell jar if the book wasn't about the pains of teenage adolescence and more about the pains of life no matter the age maybe i'd be more into it thought provoking at the very least","1298":" i really liked this book a lot the simplest way to describe \"wolf in white van\" is to say that it's about a teenage boy who tries to commit suicide with a cartridge rifle but fails he blows off his face instead on a less simple level this strange and involving novel which was nominated for a national book award is about alienation and despair and the search for meaning which sean finds in a post apocalyptic role playing game he invents turns into a business and administers by exchanging letters with its players sean developed trace italian in part while temporarily blind in the hospital \"faced with the choice of either inventing internal worlds or having no world at all to inhabit \" sean rarely leaves his house because he frightens people he causes scenes he lives inside his own head and increasingly inside trace italian his customers are the closest things he has to friends","1299":" this is a hard one to rate i am very glad i had a quiet afternoon to sit and devour this one i am not sure i would have been able to put it down and convince myself to go back to it but while i was reading it i found myself wanting to know what happened the narration which is essentially backwards was an interesting approach there was very little characterization so i did not connect with sean exactly i very much so enjoyed the portions of this book dealing with the trace italian the game all in all an interesting book by an author i would read again","1300":"really excellent more like a 4 5 5 enjoyed it a lot great novel to have kicked off my 2015 reading","1301":"the way you play trace italian seems almost unbearably quaint from a modern perspective and people usually don't believe me when i tell them it's how i supplement my monthly insurance checks but people underestimate just how starved everybody is for some magic pathway back into childhood trace italian is a mail based game a person sees a small ad for it in the back pages of analog or the magazine of fantasy and science fiction--maybe he sees the ad month after month for ages--and then one day he gets bored and sends a self addressed stamped envelope to focus games and i send him back an explanatory brochure the brochure gives a brief but vivid sketch of the game's imagined environment--no pictures just words--and explains the basic mechanics of play a trial subscription buys you four moves through the first dungeons and five dollars a month plus four first class postage stamps keep a subscription current i boil down handwritten sometimes lengthy paragraphs that players send me to simple choices--does this mean go through the door or continue down the road --and then i select the corresponding three page scenario from a file scribble a few personalized lines at the bottom and stuff it into an envelope they respond with more paragraphs sometimes pages describing how they move in reaction to where they've landed eventually they recognize the turns they've taken as segments of a path that can belong only to them like the game its story pivots around wolf in white van the first novel from the mountain goats frontman singer songwriter guitarist john darnielle is a labyrinthine construct of allusions and psychological states of being detailing to some extent the tragic isolated life of its narrator when sean phillips was seventeen living with his family in montclair ca he shot himself in the face with a marlin 39a rifle in the years since following much disquiet within his family and alongside agonizing physical rehabilitation sean has to some degree turned his life around he created focus games--a company specializing in the role playing games of old where moves are done through the mail via subscription it's an archaic style of gaming but one that engenders a more personal touch and feel as devoted players become for the game's designer a sort of extended family the first game sean developed the one that serves as the backdrop for wolf in white van's narrative is called trace italian sean first learned of the trace italienne in history class \"the trace italienne involved defensive barricades branching out around all sides of a fort stars within stars within stars visible from space one layer of protection in front of another for miles \" transposed to the post apocalyptic landscape of sean's own design the trace italian is humanity's last bastion--a safe place for those clever and determined enough to not only discover it amongst the charred remains of the world that was but to also successfully navigate its hundreds of sub dungeons technically the narrator states it's possible to get to the near mythical safe haven at the centre of the trace italian and win the game though he designed it in such a way that no one would ever live long enough to accomplish such a task while sean has managed to eke out an independent living through focus games his players are few however they are a dedicated bunch--some dangerously so and this is where much of the external conflict arises in wolf in white van a pre trial hearing in which sean is being accused of endangering minors he faces charges of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter in the case of two of his players lance and carrie who took trace italian a little too seriously becoming trapped in the kansas wilderness carrie died in the harsh environment while lance lost a foot and remains in critical condition from frostbite sean's internal conflict however threads every individual facet of the narrative darnielle's novel is like a hedgemaze with its climax ensconced somewhere in the middle revealed only in the novel's final pages the narrative circles sean's suicide attempt from both sides his life before and after the event never fully laying bare his reasons or even detailing the incident itself in this way the novel is somewhat reminiscent of the christopher nolan film memento which ends in the literal middle of its narrative but which also serves as the moment that glues the two seemingly disparate halves into a cohesive whole at its core wolf in white van is a story of vicarious living--escapism and creating fuelling escapist entertainment for others its themes are largely of consequence--of accepting it avoiding it and learning to deal with the ramifications through consequence darnielle addresses sean's demons the titular wolf in white van the characterization of the villainous voices one might hear but through his disfigurement he is also externally demonized by those closest to carrie and lance not to mention his own family who've struggled for years to understand the whys and wherefores of sean's actions in this sense sean is largely sympathetic though clearly psychologically compromised he admires iconic characters such as conan the barbarian for their outward strength yet feels he exhibits none such resilience despite his very post rifle blast existence proving otherwise as he is forced every day to bear the scars of his actions to those few friends and family still in his life not surprisingly there are parallels to some of darnielle's music within wolf in white van's dna--specifically in sean's teenage relationship with kimmy with whom sean's parents suspect he had a suicide pact while reading i couldn't help but see shreds of cathy and the nameless protagonist from the song \"this year\"--darnielle's twin high maintenance machines--in the back and forth that once existed between kimmy and sean in their youth by keeping from the reader the gory details of the aftermath of sean putting the rifle to his chin not to mention whatever concrete reasons existed behind this act in the first place darnielle has created in his narrator--mirrored by the trace italian--a puzzle that can never be solved only vaguely understood by the novel's end i felt as if i'd come within several inches of the truth but never fully arrived at a conclusion in this way wolf in white van exhibits a wonderful sense of restraint placing its priorities with ideas instead of direct answers that only would've robbed the narrative of its subtlety this is one of the best most engaging books i've read all year and a very self assured debut","1302":"so interesting written from inside an inner world where external reality and inner fantasy overlap and echo this book plays with time and reality ebb and flow creating a tapestry that explores mental health game play and family dynamics definitely worth the read","1303":"all i can say about this is that i don't understand the rave reviews why did i read this book it was boring but with just enough going on that it was like a train wreck and i wanted to know how it ended seriously hours of my life i will never get back spent hoping the book would redeem itself in the end but alas it did not","1304":"just a few words the protagonist is a very interesting and multi faceted character the plot structure is very interesting borderline experimental but darnielle pulls it off beautifully the prose and imagery is just fantastic expect to read it just to find and mark all of the remarkable passages screw it expect to read it a lot of times how is a book just 207 pages crammed with such complex ideas and emotions must read","1305":"well written and easy to read in the sense that it's a page turner but what a strange book read this if you want a short strange trip and self harm is not a trigger for you","1306":"3 5 5 starsa very different and unusual read about a guy sean who has been disfigured due to an accident in the past he created a survival game that is played through the post the story is unraveled unchronologically more specifically in reverse it is a very quiet and subtle book with themes that revolve around isolation and grief while it may be slow and wordy it is fairly short and easy to finish i liked being in the mind of the main character except for a few times where i found him to be ranting however there's just something about it that i can't seem to describe that kinda puts you in the main character's situation and you can feel almost exactly what he is feeling overall quite enjoyable for a short read although it didn't contain much substance for me to gain anything insightful from it also the sci fi tag is clearly misleading as the book is in no way sci fi at all","1307":"\"it was a simple truth something self apparent something somebody might point out to you in kindergarten when your dad was little your grandmother was just his mom like looking at a 9 upside down i pictured my dad as a teenager hair combed straight and parted on the side head cocked at the direction of a portrait studio photographer big smile and a far off gaze 'dad i am so so sorry ' i said and i could see the distance from the rim of the tower to the ground all that wasted kansas plain going on and on forever soaking up daylight and cooling to an inky black at night that spreads out uninterrupted for so long that eventually you can't see any tower at all \"i finished \"wolf in white van\" a little over a week ago and have been wanting to say something about it ever since but i keep backing off because i can't fit everything i want to say about it in a reasonable form factor but i'll give it a shot \"wolf\" tells the story of sean a 30 ish year old trauma survivor who operates a text based adventure game via snail mail the game details a never ending quest towards the trace italian a mythical refuge in post apocalyptic kansas as the first person account works backwards towards an at first mysterious accident both the trace and its creator become deeply intwined post accident sean exists in a world comprised of discrete moves and theoretical futures everything is a jigsaw piece a series of doors and alleyways all occupying space \"like most things mom started to say about the accident this went nowhere there were too many places for it to go so when it opened out onto its great vista of sad possibilities it just rested there frozen by the view \"it's the first full novel by john darnielle i e the mountain goats and i was amazed at how well his lyrical sensibilities were adapted to prose it's gorgeously written like his music \"wolf\" imbibes daily struggles with unblinking earnesty and romance taking wild leaps from realism to fantasy mid sentence while making perfect emotional sense there are a handful of passages which blew me away in how well they communicated the feeling of growing up and forgetting of \"belong ing to a tiny secret brotherhood of people who'd forgotten something hard \" engaging sad and -- like all of his work -- extremely hopeful it's a book about seeking refuge whether or not refuge can ever be found because \"it's really just simple math the whole of it there are only two stories either you go forward or you die \"i really loved it","1308":"\"for reasons that seem obvious to me i don't believe in happy endings or even in endings at all but i am as susceptible to moments of indulgent fantasy as anybody else \" this is one complex yet very interesting read it's cool weird enticing this book is short but it will make you ponder over it for ages it has the power to leave you speechless and the writing maann it's so superb the reverse manner of telling the events is so cool even though at first i found it hard to connect with the book but the ending it's a killer and i guess the strongest point yes it has an ending but it really doesn't have one it leaves room for more but leaving it just as it is will also be totally okay","1309":"3 5 stars it should probably be 4 stars but it was a little too unsettling and grim for that i don't know why i liked this book when i just finished the southern reach trilogy and didn't like that at all those are also sort of vague and dream like without a linear plot i suppose it's because the subject here is so much more personal and i loved the nerdy bits and the game descriptions and sometimes it made me think of my own teenager and what he must think of me i would have loved to have more of almost all the other characters in the book i guess i just wish there were more of this book overall","1310":" i struggled a bit with this book perhaps because it's entirely backward looking that is the suspense is dependent on the gradual reveal of a secret in the past this led to a bit of frustration and the feeling that the narrator was being deliberately coy and basically a lack of profluence that made the novel something of a chore to read at times still it's well written and at the end one is left with a sense of profound resonance a feeling that something important has been communicated about the crazy society we live in at this moment in history recommended","1311":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here definitely the best book i've ever read about an attempted suicide i know this character well i wish darnielle wrote more dialog he's exceptional at it","1312":" oh my this is a tough read this is a dark story and as it so happened a book club selection i can only begin to imagine the reaction that our members will have safe to say that most are not going to like it i won't be surprised if a good number of them simply put it down never to return to it this was a story that i wasn't sure i'd finish despite its short length the first two chapters have a raving quality that makes it very hard to understand what is happening it is until the 3rd chapter that you get a glimpse of what the story is or might be about the story is told in the first person by a young man named sean phillips over the course of the next few chapters the story unfolds and you come to learn that some interesting and haunting facts about sean sean suffered some sort of tragic accident as a teenager sean created a role playing game called trace italian that he has built a business around a separate tragic accident results from someone who plays the game beyond that i'd rather not say more about the plot the art of this book is in the telling and the way the story unfolds the narration is done in such a way that sean recounts things from his past present and imagination in an almost stream of consciousness sort of way i rate this book at 4 stars b c i found the story well told interesting and unlike anything else i've ever read that said this isn't a book i will be recommending to anyone its simply too disturbing for many readers","1313":"this book is disturbing and intriguing there is something here that is very true about the gulf between a teenager and his parents i am stuck between 3 and 4 stars partly because i am discomfited","1314":" so begins my first of many reviews for all ten 2015 alex award winners at mchs we decided to change our summer reading requirements this year our incoming juniors and seniors will pick one alex winner so i decided to play along and join in too i picked wolf in white van because it was short and i wanted to get my feet wet and to be honest it wasn't all that fantastic wolf in white van had a lot of potential this novel tells the story of a young man forced to be a shut in after a seriously disfiguring gunshot wound the story is told in reverse which was interesting but that really wasn't enough to save it for me the voice was crisp and fresh but i couldn't identify with the character enough to care what was happening to him it went even deeper than not identifying i didn't like the main character in the short span of this novel i couldn't bring myself really get immersed the details were intentionally left vague but that really isn't my style this novel didn't really live up to what i was hoping for hopefully the next one sets the bar a little higher","1315":"beautifully written crazy disturbing i found this book challenging because i just could not identify with sean and i think that was the point he was brilliant poignant and totally manic i found myself hating him for all of the reasons he knew you would it was just a real mindfuck and i liked that loved the open ending loved the uncertainty read this book in two sittings and i'd happily recommend it","1316":" so much potential so little of it realized it's an interesting premise but darnielle has nothing interesting to say about it i don't need to be told what to think about a thing and i don't really need to know what the author thinks about a thing but i would at least like to know what his characters think about a thing so many sentences in this book were like and then i saw something that reminded me of a memory without any further explanation as to what those things were at the end we can only speculate about why sean did what he did and why the criminally underdeveloped lance and carrie and chris haynes did what they did so what then is the point given that sean has a pretty decent life sure he's a nerd but so were many of us and he has parents in a marriage that is at least semi functional and he's even getting a little action which is more than a lot of high school nerds can say is this just a story about a guy who view spoiler shoots himself in the face just so he has a reason to feel the isolation that he's already been inexplicably feeling hide spoiler and then lives to regret his stupid stupid decision the mail order text based adventure game stuff was cool and a thing i haven't read about before but it was largely shunted aside in favor of nothing essentially it seems like hence the two stars people seem to like this but i think they're giving darnielle more credit than he deserves for using his status as one of the best lyricists of our time to push out a piece of half baked crap","1317":" as a mountain goats fan probably the main reason why anyone would get their hands on this immediately or immediately as you can when you have few ideas for christmas presents i am predisposed to liking this book that said it is quite a brilliant and look at the world through darnielle's incisive wit sharp use of imagery and dealing with the world when everything has seemingly gone to shit my only gripe with the narrative especially compared to darinelle's 33 1 3 book is that sean the narrator is almost too witty clever and this dry taciturn voice is too controlled and makes the story a bit sterile like the author is the in the role of game designer himself and you can see the choices and pathways too obviously with each chapter read this book it's a good one","1318":"i was frustrated with some of the stories that got started but not really elaborated tell me more about lance u0026amp carrie u0026amp kimmy but overall this was a great weird nerdy u0026amp surprisingly quick read","1319":"i'm kinda disappointed the prose was stark and pretty but seemed to meander after finishing it a few days ago i still cannot discern sean's motive which either means i wasn't paying attention or it wasn't there","1320":"i can't decide if i want to reread this immediately or never again","1321":" too smart damn like how did he write this so smartly like you can't get over the fact that this writer is just so smart the way he looks at things the way he perceives shapes and culture and light and shadows and art i thought this was about video games but this game was something so beyond my understanding of contemporary culture really blew me away because it was so confusing and convoluted that i couldn't help but imagine that people would actually do this because they already play convoluted video games and all that online gameplay shit it confuses me in every way so this was a game that was more confusing but intellectually sensical it provided such a peculiar image of how people think and how people imagine new worlds it's so applicable to social media and the other versions that people see of themselves via facebook twitter insta etc etc i know it's cliche to say that but it's the easiest way for me to put it into an intelligible framework people really convince themselves that they are multiple people and it's both an amazing ability but also a curse in some ways the double edged sword of the limitless imagination this portrait of the human imagination is incredible and cuts so deep im blown away damn i think i will be paying a lot more attention to darnielle's lyrics in his songs now","1322":"i only picked this book up because of the mountain goats connection the story didn't really appeal but wow what a surprise every time i put this book down i had to stop and think the game angle is really secondary here this is a book about life lives lives that have perhaps been squandered or not such a thought provoking and beautifully written novel john darnielle love love love","1323":"impatient readers need not apply here but if you allow the hypnotic voice and fragmented imagery and disjointed narrative structure to carry you away you can and will find great reward in these pages to me this isn't a novel in the conventional sense it is more of a twisted yet highly readable mind map of the protagonist a horribly disfigured young man who invents a choose your own adventure game called trace italian he creates and runs this game via snail mail partly to help heal both his mind and his body after he shots himself in the face and has to spend a very long time in a hospital the game attracts a cult following and two teenagers a boyfriend and girlfriend actually get so into the game that they lose touch with reality and one of them the girl dies while playing it another player dies as well under similar circumstances but thematically speaking these are minor because the game and wolf in white van itself too really is just a metaphor for the human brain and the very wonderful and truly horrific things it is capable of i guess you could also file this novel under the character study category which i enjoy especially if the character in question is so confounding and this one definitely qualifies as i read this book i started to imagine that i was traveling down every single synapse in this guy's brain that i had access to every thought dream nightmare fear fantasy and yet i still couldn't say i know what makes him tick to the book's credit there is a passage in here where the protagonist actually admits there isn't anything that makes him tick you could also discuss at length the various ways in which imagination plays a key role in fiction in general and this novel in particular but i'm just going to suggest you start reading it and see for yourself bottom line i finished wolf in white van almost a week ago and i've found myself thinking about it every day since what else can i say","1324":"as i made my way through this story it became more and more clear that the point of reading it wasn't a more conventional to see what happens but to experience through john's shocking prose a newfound empathy with a character who through the lens of a less gifted writer would be unapproachable john's mastery of phrasing and description which will be familiar to any mountain goats fans is on full display and left me breathless more than a brief novel like this should","1325":"this book this book um i'm giving it four actually four and a half stars because it is very well written interesting and engaging i had to finish it did i like it yeah not quite sure it was dark light depressing uplifting dangerous benign so many questions even after finishing it read it listen to it tell me what you think","1326":"up until reading this book there were parts of myself i thought that nobody on earth had ever been able to see or describe shame on me for not having faith in darnielle to put it into words i obviously am not in the same predicament that sean finds himself in nor do i see the world in the same way that he sometimes does but there are moments in wolf that remind me of the darkest most lonely times i ever had as a teenager this is an incredible exercise in empathy so so good","1327":"in bleats of sorrow like gnawed tin the goat can really write","1328":"beautifully written account through the eyes of a young survivor of a self inflicted wound","1329":" i received a copy of this book through the first reads giveaways ten second synopsis sean the creator of a mail based role playing game talks us through various traumatic events that have occurred in his life working backwards chronologically from the present i found it hard to assign a star rating to this book because i think its narrative style will have a particular audience that others will find off putting or too difficult to engage with i personally prefer dialogue driven novels and find excessive monologuing tedious in most cases and this book is practically one long monologue where the reader only has sean's thoughts for company while i found sean to be very engaging in parts other parts lagged and i found myself wondering what the overall point of the novel was i very much enjoyed the sections describing the trace italian game and how sean interacted with the various players but just as i was settling into these sections they would segue into more monologuing it took me a few chapters to orient myself in the story as sean isn't forthcoming about how he ended up as he is now and the early chapters seemed to meander a bit by about the fourth or fifth chapter though i was engaged with the story and waiting for the action to take off unfortunately it's not the kind of novel where action is important so my desire was never sated overall i'm not entirely sure whether i enjoyed this book or not i finished it which indicates that there were more positive points than negative otherwise i would have put it aside but i'm left feeling mildly dissatisfied with the overall experience i suspect it was a little too introspective for my personal tastes but i can think of a few people of my acquaintance who would love the style and the content and i'll therefore recommend it to them","1330":"this was an amazing debut novel i hope we'll see more danielle has amazing insight into depression isolation and the ability to accept oneself truly lovely","1331":"i could eat this book it's that fantastic i'm doing this thing i've done with a few books before i'm reading slowly deliberately you can see that the man is a poet and a songwriter there are moments of a real beauty here and i'd rather it not end damn","1332":"i wish there was a 3 5 stars there is so much to love in this book i loved the title of the book and its background and thought that the protagonist's game was perfectly named trace italian the writing was clever and imaginative and i liked the voice of the unique main character ultimately the plot lagged a bit for me and i am not convinced that this should not have been a powerful short story rather than a novel also there is a certain kind of melancholy that shows up in many novels that just does not resonate so much with me these days that was probably the case here i felt that the novel found its emotional note and then stayed there with very little fluctuation","1333":"i can see how this would be for some it was not written for me i'm not part of the tribe this was written for the cover was terribly enticing though","1334":"i just didn't get it it makes me feel dumb to admit that but i didn't get it also it's really depressing","1335":" amazing one of the best books of 2014 207 mesmerizing pages that i read in 3 sittings i have never read anything like this big ideas that don't shout at once gentle and brutal wolf in white van tells a story about a teenager--a fantasy lover a gamer sort of a loner--who approaches the edge of inner darkness and keeps going here is sean's reflection as an adult who runs a post apocalyptic role playing game through snail mail on imagination and why we hurt ourselves--and what that means if anything we all create an imaginary world to cope with living in this one how far is too far too deep in fantasy i marveled at darnielle's creation of a completely authentic multidimensional narrator struggling as we all do with the evil and confusion that rumbles up inside us when we contemplate our mortality and power sean leads us through a sometimes perplexing shadowy path with unexpected empathy and spirit darnielle's craft is inimitable","1336":"astonishing","1337":"not the deepest i've ever been struck by john darnielle's writing but unnerving implacable with a skillful tread that doesn't get lost in its constant motions back and forth in time space reality and bloody invention","1338":"a three star book exalted sort of because so much takes place on monte vista in a world i have seen and smelled and heard and driven by but really because of the reference to the upland pic n save a world that i have truly experienced i love jd for bringing the glorious 909 to the masses","1339":"i really loved his observations his emotions his character but the whole trace italian thing was hard for me i listened to the audio and am glad i did i think what could have felt cold reading it felt a lot more relatable due to the narrator's author's voice wish i could give it a 3 75","1340":"i love mountain goats music and this book was given to me as a birthday gift i liked it very much like darnielles lyrics it was unusual and rather sad i do not want to spoil it for you ny saying more i hope he will write more books and more songs","1341":" this was a really strange book i think i was expecting something entirely different because some people have shelved it as sci fi i'm guessing they didn't read it first because the game in the description is one where he created this world and people would send him their move by mail with a sase of course and he would look in his filing cabinet to get the corresponding result and send it back using the sase not exactly sci fi the game itself was truly endlessly fascinating this was probably my favorite aspect of the story when i was 7 or 8 i would design my own board games so this really clicked for me despite the fact that his world was a million times more involved than my own designs the exploration of his life was a bit less complete for me because there were unanswered questions i never once grew bored though it was very engrossing","1342":"good enough to finish but thru out the nagging sense of how much more could have been done with this story","1343":"tremendously upsetting viscously tender","1344":"i think this might be the most thoughtful and caring representation of teenage isolation and depression i've ever seen it's respectful and almost reverent to the way this unnamed darkness can build up inside a young person without any real reason and drive them down i also really loved it's representation of the way behavior or tendencies from your childhood shift but stay with you as you grow up they portrayal of adult isolation is good too it paints it more as isolation in contest with the rest of the world the isolation has been accepted and welcomed but is constantly challenged by the outside the writing is calm and patient and never pulls at you which i like it felt good but not like good it felt good in the way that sad music feels good","1345":"its essentially a mountain goats song in book form","1346":"john darnielle's novel 'wolf in white van' is engrossing troubling revealing i couldn't stop reading it and loved a lot of it though much of the time i felt as if i was averting my eyes from the page","1347":"it's interesting to compare wolf in white van to ready player one and perhaps ernest cline's new book armada which seems to be cut from the same pastel cloth both are rooted in childhood escapism writ large both take the idea of survival through a game and make it the core of the story but ready player one is itself a piece of escapism that's not a dig at the book it's true i hated it yet i can't fault anyone from finding a nice cool place to hide for as long as it lasts to read rp1 is to participate in its fantasy of a world where knowledge of obscure 80s trivia is a survival skill its characters are simple heroes and villains drawn in broad strokes again this is by design escapism can't be reflective wolf in white van unlike rp1 is not an easy book that's not to say it makes its readers better people tempting as that is i'd hate to give a hipster like argument that wiwv is better because it has literary ambitions than rp1 doesn't it's like criticizing a horror movie for not being good for kids that was never its goal in the first place but it's safe to say that i greatly prefer wiwv i enjoy books that reflect the human condition books that eschew simplistic good guys and bad guys in favor of real people who don't always do things that make sense wiwv is about survival and escapism but it is not itself escapist the protagonist and narrator shawn phillips is a dense and complex person in other words he's a person as the book proceeds shawn tries to unravel the intertwined emotions around an event that left his face horribly disfigured as we go through shawn's day to day life we see the horror his deformed face inflicts on others curiosity too shawn is most comfortable with metalhead teenagers whose directness is comforting and who remind shawn of who he was the day his life changed shawn's mind was not a pleasant place as a kid he had violent visions and he could sense a horrible destructive tendency buried deep within himself his parents worry about his fantasy novels and loud music thinking that they are causing turbulence in his life as any metalhead will tell you cathartic art like metal and conan books are an incredible salve for adolescent misery they spell a world that acknowledge pain and destruction unlike most adolescent fare that tries to bury that in smilies and sunshine but they formalize that pain draw borders around it create threshold of tolerance it allows kids to come to an understanding with life's darkest truths sometimes it's the only credible thing to cling to darnielle writes how shawn's dark violent childhood visions differ from conan's universe conan lives deep in blood and war but he lives by a just moral code shawn pictures himself in a bony throne arbitrarily casting anyone he can find into a fiery pit innocent guilty doesn't matter his demons are made of strong stuff and so something happens and shawn's life and those of his loving but controlling parents changes forever to cope shawn falls into the therapeutic embrace of world building and game design as a game designer myself with my own privileged yet unhappy childhood there's a lot about shawn's story that resonated with me sure i never had the psychopathic urges he has but i had my share of stormy nights and i know what it's like to find refuge in a game so we find ourselves again looking at the gulf between wiwv and rp1 similar shores an ocean apart both about games being a safe place to find a few minutes' grace from a painful life stories about games can be tricky at some point it's just easier to make the damn game i know of one game designer andrew looney who started his design career by wanting to flesh out the details of a futuristic game icehouse that he was writing about it's easy to fall into the world of the game as marcel duchamp fell out of the world of art into chess i've seen game designers who have a mirror image problem they have a story they want to tell but they make a game of it instead the problem is that game designers aren't storytellers as a game designer you must surrender agency over your narrative your players control their fates your players tell the story you're just giving them their vocabulary and grammar to do so this turns out to be shawn's salvation he's haunted by the many roads his life could have taken through arbitrating his play by mail rpg shawn gets to live infinite lives living out all possible choices in the game at once that is his ultimate escape never once having to see his in game identity collapse quantum like into a single observable entity the game is immersive and addictive perhaps too much so one player realizes how wrapped up he is in it and quits another does something far worse this is not cline's glib easter egg hunt it's a seeping of grim reality into the stronghold of fantasy it's the castle walls showing a terminal crack he admits that his game is not winnable nobody will ever make it to the sanctuary in the end but that's okay i made a game like that once designed to pull people into another world but not really winnable it wasn't for them it was for me the sanctuary is the game itself the goal isn't to win the game it's to try to win the game to take an action or two that define your character's class to spend some time in the world of the game that will not count in real life to in the words of bernard suits voluntarily attempt to overcome an unnecessary obstacle to deal with the infinity of choice in a safe place that unlike real life is guaranteed to be definitive and meaningful what do we do this turn where will that leave us next turn the game slices our decisions into discrete chunks whose outcomes we can quantify this gives us a peace and understanding like a poorly recorded blast beat on a cassette from a tampa area death metal band or conan delivering justice to an evil barbarian horde or a border drawn over water not visible to the naked eye but meaningful all the same","1348":"superbly emulates the thoughts and working of a human mind it felt like i was reading a person's brain in real time","1349":"an enjoyable read solid 4 4 5 stars loved this book at first but after a week long break from reading when i returned to it the luster was missing can't pinpoint why exactly but i think it was because the ending wasn't as satisfying as i'd hoped","1350":" interesting premise but i had a lot of trouble with understanding the protagonist and really the motivations of any of the characters part of the problem is that the story is not told chronologically a story telling device i am normally okay with but did not like in this book sean a man with a very disfigured face so disfigured he rarely goes out in public and when he does is openly stared at and commented on with disgust lives at home rarely seeing anyone but his home nurse he runs several roleplaying games through the mail people mail him their next moves and $10 a month he writes them back with what happens next in the story but two young people lance and carrie playing the game do very foolish and dangerous things while playing and a court has to decide whether sean is liable for what happened to them the book jumps around between three time points the event that disfigured sean include the days leading up to the event and after the period of time where he is working on the game and corresponding with lance and carrie as well as chris haynes who i wish we knew more about and during and after the court case and i felt dissatisfied with the amount of detail and exposition for each of these time points i guess part of the point is that sean sees himself as three different people he doesn't understand what earlier seans did and so we shouldn't either presumably because this is how we all are it's hard to understand our younger selves decisions but as the reader i was left feeling frustrated with the characters not just sean but also lance and carrie just not making a sense i would just have preferred more depth in one of the time points such as the court case and the others could've just not been a part of the story","1351":"this novel lives in the space between 3 5 4 i love the main concept of this story and darnielle did a great job at working backwards throughout the book i did feel that some ideas emotions were a bit underdeveloped and could have used a bit more time to cultivate i do wish that lance carrie's story was a bit more fleshed out and i would have liked more time spent with trace italian that said sean is a good main character and i liked his voice for the most part","1352":"just a marvelous story this book just grabbed me from the start so well told such beautiful prose a wonderful first effort","1353":"merely oka bit too tangential and meandering at times the book felt like it was trying too hard to be deep or dark or i don't know i'll be damned if the dropping of a krull reference wasn't endearing though not a bad book by any means and there is something to be said for being short not overstaying one's welcome","1354":"intriguing at the start but left me cold by the end","1355":" wolf in white vani really didn't like this book that is probably the most unhelpful thing i've ever written into a review as it doesn't tell you why and help you the review reader have any basis to know whether my reasons for not liking it would cause you to feel the same or whether you should proceed on as my reasons would have no bearing on your enjoyment i never would have picked this book but read it because my book club is reading it and i always try to read those books i actually voted against it twice when it was nominated but alas i was out voted i wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity to discuss a book with my friends and as a result i've read some stuff i'd never would have picked my real life friends would tell you that i'd be hard pressed to have to sit back and listen to other people talk rather than dominate the conversation because i had nothing to contribute about a book i didn't read does this sometimes result in me being pleasantly surprised by how well i like something rarely as i know my tastes pretty well but it is possible and i was hoping i would like this book what was interesting about this book a couple things *ttrace italian - the role playing game that sean operates in this game is the most interesting part if we could have a \"choose your own adventure\" style book of the trace italian clue that would have been more enjoyable than this novel not so enjoyable that i'm going to go spend the night in a ditch in below freezing weather mind you because i'm not an idiot *tthe after effects of a life altering injury - i think the best part of this book is the portrayal of sean's struggles in the world after the destruction of his face his father having to carry him down the hall at age 17 the difficulties he has going out in public even to the grocery store without drawing tons of attention the fact that he has to tell the stoners in the parking lot that he can't even have a sip of beer unless he has a straw because of the damage to his face and if that is your life why wouldn't you be carrying a damn straw around with you at all times - just more of his stupidity i think that this aspect of the book showed more actual thought on the author's part than anything else *tthe role of \"blame someone for your own stupidity\" litigation - sean is defending himself from a lawsuit by carrie's parents because he developed the game there is a parallel plot in a different timeline where sean's parents are searching for a deep pocket to sue for his own actions it's a fun parallel but our dense protagonist sean doesn't even seem to appreciate the irony of this or if he does he doesn't bother to convey that to the readers *tthe split time line - we are moving between multiple timelines a the current in which sean is defending himself in a lawsuit about trace italian b the recent past in which sean is sending next moves to lance and carrie and also other players c shortly after sean is released from the hospital after he lost his face and d high school aged sean and the events that lead up to his events that changed his life if i liked this book better i'd probably line up how all these timelines move throughout the book as i love doing that but i frankly didn't want to spend any more time digging through this book what specifically didn't i like about this book *tsean the protagonist is not well drawn as i don't understand why he does what he does even worse than not understanding him frankly he's unlikeable enough that i don't care *tthe side characters are also not well drawn did kimmy break his heart did she break a promise suicide pact did she just drift away because his parents prevented her from having access to sean we don't know enough about her to draw any conclusions and i don't actually care why does she come back again just to mention that she is now married don't have a clue and not sure if we care *twhat is the point of james - maybe i'm missing the big connections here that is possible i'm happy to be corrected by readers who got more out of this book than i did but why did we have the character of james who quit trace italian by choice near the fortune teller's cabin and sean wrote a death certificate then we see him at the government office when sean goes to renew his business license why just so that we know he actually survived even though he \"died\" in trace italian not everyone who plays this game dies that's a glowing endorsement if i've ever read one *tteen suicide attempts or was it - i just generally hate books that deal with teen suicide and particularly hated thirteen reasons why for this reason this book isn't as bad as it did address the after effects and sean having to live with the damage to his face and body as a result but did he actually learn anything that certainly isn't clear *twhy does any of this matter why should anyone care about any of these people or events *tpuffy tom hanks hair the most memorable thing about this book was that i was constantly reminded of \"mazes and monsters\" the 1982 movie with tom hanks in which young adults got too involved in a dungeons and dragons type live action role play game to disastrous results anything which reminds me that often of the 1980s era tom hanks puffy hairstyle is a bad thing ok so in sum this book wasn't my cup of tea there were a couple interesting parts but those to me did not justify having to slog with all the rest of this mess of a novel","1356":"john darnielle is definitely a gifted writer he develops beautiful moments that are sad and rich with detail the only reason this is not a higher rating is because the story itself does not quite feel complete or whole the way i felt like it needed to it at times felt like a short story that has been made into a novel and moments were repetitive or the reason for certain information or stories misdirected the reader but didn't quite payoff it is difficult to explain that being said i will definitely read or listen to another one of his book","1357":" i bought this at the perth writers' festival after hearing the author speak and i ended up reading the book within a week i thought i'd like this and i was right basically it's a literary novel about a guy who shoots himself in the face and lives to create his own play by post roleplaying game a couple of teenagers take the game too literally with dire consequences and our protagonist has to face an ultimately pointless lawsuit that's the plot of wolf in white van in its entirety this isn't a plot based book what it is instead is a very well written account of what it's like to be and i mean this kindly an introspective freak the story is told pretty much from the last event to the first a bit like the film momento and it works well the novel as a whole worked very well i thought and i'll be happy to read more from darnielle again in the future bravo","1358":" i am not surprised at all to see such mixed reviews on the site the writing is great the way in which the story unfolds is interesting the subjects explored are incredibly complex and the author makes excellent use of first person writing that being said i didn't really connect to the book or the main character emotionally honestly i'm not sure i was supposed to i don't think that we are asked to pity the narrator much like the way a player will never make it all the way into trace italian and it is made fairly clear to us that we will never fully understand him or what he did again i know it was done on purpose but i there is no real satisfying conclusion to the book no real morals to be learned and at least for me no emotions felt for the story of character i think it's a great study in how to tell a story however i personally did not connect with it","1359":"i really did not like this book and would not have finished reading it if not for the fact that it was chosen for this month's book club i had high hopes after seeing it on a number of top rated books for 2014 but wasn't able to get into it and was ready to give up about 10 pages in the book had a very fragmented feel to it this might have been intentional but didn't help the book is any way after finishing i am still unsure as to what the point of the book was there were too many events characters and realities that were introduced but never really fully explained i would not recommend this book to anyone reading challenge book by an author you have never read before","1360":"great in beginning slowed down a lot at the end very fantasy oriented and descriptive though overall super depressing the narrator is a boy with an unknown deformity that becomes more clear as the book progresses he gives his perspective of the world and his game and past events in all their strangeness overall good but not a page turner","1361":"i'm not sure that i'm deep enough to get this book i picked it up because i love text based adventure games and i love the mountain goats but i never really caught my stride on this book it was jolting with that momento style backwards fragmented storytelling i guess if you're into the subtle the obscured you might appreciate it more than i did","1362":" this is a good first effort from darnielle but the plot is thin and it doesn't have the heft of a good character study the book puts us in the head of a physically disfigured and emotionally damaged recluse who spends his time operating a play by mail rpg much of the prose is lovely and haunting however i didn't come away with a good understanding of what motivated sean he remained an enigma to me even to the last page perhaps that's the author's intent but i finished the book feeling frustrated i look forward to darnielle's next book","1363":" chilling nerdy and intriguing having been a fan of zork back in the day nerds you know what i'm talking about the fact that the main character runs a mail order text based role playing game was such fun to begin with the book has a memeto style reverse storyline which darnielle crafts in such a way that you you end up making deals with yourself long after your bedtime one more chapter one more chapter the book is a mere 200 pages but darnielle really gets at what it is like to be other the disfigured main character articulates his otherness in sad and beautiful ways it made me think about my face and what it projects to the world every moment that i'm in public i haven't read a book that did that since the elephant man","1364":"john darnielle has a pleasant way of describing things that i could relate to however the overall story i found very lacking in direction or depth","1365":" for something that was a little over 200 pages this turned out to be a harder read though i will admit that my expectations for this book were pretty high over the praise i heard from a couple of online reviews as well as a couple skim reads of the synopsis on my part i just found myself skim reading some of the book there wasn't really much of a plot besides the narrator sean talking about before and after his accident i can relate to him in the sense that he is very sheltered introverted and always into his books and video games my high expectations came when i read in the synopsis that sean had created a gaming text based system trans italian which i immediately thought ready player one oasis in no way am i shitting on this book the writing was not the issue at all i just had my expectations too high","1366":"i really wanted it to be good but this book is a whole lot of unpleasant sprinkled with some excellent character insight to be honest i'm relieved it's over","1367":"this book will make you be present for every single sentence and then go check out his music every song is a story","1368":" there's only one word to describe this book and that word is haunting i feel like darnielle reaches some deeper level of subconscious in his novel some moments i was enraptured by the amount of relation i could have to the character but at other moments i couldn't have been farther from what he was thinking however despite the roller coaster of relating to the main guy darnielle manages to keep a flow of beautiful and poetic wording in a style all his own overall if you're looking for something that takes you to another world and that begins at the end this is the story for you","1369":" equal parts disturbing and engrossing darnielle's debut novel is a quick read but not an easy one the juxtaposition of multiple realities serves as a backdrop for the author to beg questions on the search for narrative and reason in all things whether in one's own realm of experience the broader world in which one's choices may influence unknown others or the collective imagination for fans of darnielle's music under the moniker the mountain goats you will find the same undercurrent of dark subject matter that at times flirts with existential absurdism and explores deep pain but doesn't descend into brooding or emotional heft that is put on similarly wolf in white van is challenging yet rewarding recommended and slated for a second reading","1370":"we know from the novel's first pages that sean phillips has been involved in some kind of an accident an accident so serious that his survival was in question for some time and one from which sean will never escape the consequences as he is now permanently disfigured so disfigured in fact that he rarely leaves his house because of the attention he draws at one point he states that unless you work in the medical field you're not prepared to see me sean relies on his imagination to push forward through his difficult recovery and rehabilitation and in that process creates a fantasy role playing game called trace italian in which players try and make their way to a safe fortress in a post apocalyptic america this is just before the internet age 1990 and players take their turns by mail for which sean charges a small monthly fee when the internet does make its appearance sean finds that his subscriber base remains steady with no shortage of people nostalgic for these games of their childhood the revelation that there has been a serious accident with serious consequences but without details makes for a unique narrative structure in which through sean's memories and ruminations of game play and players the reader slowly learns more and more of sean's backstory until finally all is revealed about that fateful moment the result is a contemplative novel with beautifully illustrative and at times breathtaking prose somewhat in the mold of a robinson or harding this is a novel about being different and getting to know sean both prior to and after the accident the reader learns that though he didn't turn heads on the street prior to the event he has always felt very different there is a scene in the book when sean learns that he will be moving to some kind of transitional care home after he turns 18 and his mother feeling guilty but also feeling like she can't properly care for him at home says that she worries he'll be lonely sean revealingly states i was going to be lonely anyway this novel's strength is putting the reader in the mind of one who is different one who is truly lonely and getting a feel for how they cope in a world in which it seems they were never meant to thrive darnielle actually gives us a few characters through which we learn these lessons some friends before the event some game players who take the fantasy too far but in the end it is mainly through sean and his two selves his before and after that we learn the most wolf in white van will leave you wondering if people could somehow sense the disfigurement in the soul of a person like sean could the outward disfigurement have been avoided and whether there is a sean somewhere within your own sphere of influence and could you know it","1371":"this was different i can't quite think of a better way to describe it on a personal level it helped me better understand those who are close to me who struggle with depression though that's not really what it's about it's about regret without really being at all about hope but it isn't really a downer because of that it's a backward story in multiple ways and the way it ended and began all at once was unsatisfying because i did not want it to end but it was also undoubtedly the best possible ending because it felt the way that every story's ending should","1372":" a genuinely haunting read and another book revolving around a traumatic incident from the protagonist's past details of which are saved for a third act big reveal the difference here is that facile cause effect explanations are elusive bringing to mind the chilling line from king lear as flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods they kill us for their sport it's creepy as sin to see the material culture of my early adolescence 70s 80s era fantasy science fiction fan cultures role playing games magazine classifieds u0026amp mail order get remixed in such a startling way i assumed i knew where this novel was heading and was proven wrong every step of the way","1373":"i wanted to like this but it never really went anywhere and i am still trying to determine what sort of story it was trying to tell and then it just sort of ended with no real resolution just a fizzling out of the words","1374":"this book is extremely well written and mind bending the protagonist is very disturbed we spend the entire book within his head my recommendation is not to read this book close to bedtime i read it on recommendation from a young library colleague finishing it out of respect for him","1375":" 24 pages in this is impenetrable and overrated 34 pages in i am crying it's hard for me to put into words but this is inexplicably the best book i've read for a long time i read it in one night and i was exhausted but i couldn't sleep the characters everything it's so real because you're not called to empathize to a herculean degree and because of that you are i'm not the kind of person to become invested in characters' lives and deaths as much as i am in how they are laid out this book is full of characters who don't demand emotional attachment to them with constant descriptions of the narrator's yearning and when it does the emotions are so much more complex than most anything i've read so much more human than anything i've read and i suspect that whenever i say human or real i mean so much more like me the structure alone is miraculously well plotted and unique there are some things that i understand perfectly from experience and some things that are completely foreign to me and they're all interesting and not just drudging things up but so immediate i feel like i'm straddling between two worlds but most of all it's real i stopped worrying about being triggered and i stopped worrying completely because well this probably won't make sense to other people but because everything that happened was utterly realistic for better or worse so the suicideality and dissociation stopped being little clusters of my own memories and labels and paradigms and started being experiences like i used to have when i didn't think about what was happening in my brain this way but not i suppose i mean that it shows by telling people always say in writing you're supposed to show not tell but writing is telling if it's told well enough it's real it's hard for me to write clearly about it but i don't think i'll ever not be too tired to string together my ideas except for a few moments while reading this when i remembered what it was like to want to do things and then when i remembered what it was like to not i'll probably never read it again","1376":"through various mechanisms and very deft writing we really get to know sean and yet we never go too far astray with the various plot lines that develop his character this is a darker hairier version of the coming of age story and really more of a coming undone story very good","1377":"interesting and short read i found myself really enjoying the book even though it give me a sense of isolation in the tone of the narration i reread the ending multiple times and still am not sure if i really understand it but i like it regardless it has a very original style of story telling","1378":" jesus this is one heavy fucking book it's some of the most personal fiction i've read not in the sense that it is in any way autobiographical but in the sense that you will close the covers changed in some way because of either your identification with or your disgust for this character the jacket flap and lots of reviews like to talk about how the story is told in reverse it isn't true the time line is a little flexible but the story is told exactly as it needs to be revealed to even mention the time line seems to completely miss the point of the narrator's mindset to miss the obvious repetition of the narrator's thoughts to miss the desire to avoid thinking about the tragedy this is the type of book i really wish there were more of it's no jodi picoult school shooting tragedy or john greene's it's okay because in the end they had love bullshit this is real and it hurts and you should read it","1379":"i read this through in one sitting i need to think about it for awhile before i can write a review i liked it a lot but i'm not sure if i can explain why","1380":"this was great no surprise lots of flashing back forth through time without seeming gimmicky good character and story detail while still leaving room to imagine more i am not smart enough to extensively compare this to his songwriting except to say i enjoy both","1381":"solid debut from the lead singer of the mountain goats the book is about a young man disfigured in what is initially described as the incident and who in his convalescence has become a bit of a recluse engaging the outside world through a play by mail game he's invented the story is kind of a reverse narrative that works its way back to the incident revealing the main character along the way by the time i reached the end i wasn't terribly surprised but i'm not sure i was supposed to be surprised at all it's really more of a character study and in that it's quite successful good title especially in light of how the idea of the wolf in white van appears briefly in the story i'll keep an eye out for darnielle's next book","1382":"an okay book that very slowly builds up to a moment and then it ends","1383":"favorite book read in 2015","1384":" i love john darnielle's band the mountain goats i must have several hundred songs by the group the albums zopilate machine and all hail west texas are two of my favorite albums darnielle's lyrics can be so beautiful poignant and perfect so i was nervous but hopeful about this novel overall the book is well written and fully thought out but i didn't love it by a long margin the story meanders along flashing through different times in the narrator's life but then come to s sudden halt describing the most crucial moment of the protagonist's life and it's all over there are dangling threads of characters hanging all throughout the text what was the result of the trial did he ever go and talk to chris did he go to the surgeon much is left unanswered in the narrative but we hear a lot of the narrator's inner thoughts i think there could have been time to finish more fully i didn't feel like the main character progressed much all a bit disappointing","1385":"i'm going to re read this book backwards to uncover all the satanic messages my mind only subliminally absorbed when i read it from front to back the first time","1386":" cool cover huh and i got it on sale from audible a few months ago sounded good in the review and was on sale and had that cool cover why not meh it's okay it's not bad but if we were talking and you asked me why i liked it so much i couldn't give an answer i'm not even sure i can tell you what it's about other than what it says in the book description no surprises no laughs no deep realizations about life on my part it was just you know a book looking at reviews i see that some people find this a very thoughtful book that made them continue thinking even after they finished others like me don't seem very intrigued by anything here i didn't dislike it mind you i just i needed more i guess","1387":"the story was a little unusual in how it was structured but it wasn't too hard to get into the story itself seemed to end to me at least ambiguously like there wasn't a theme that really tied it together for me the story just sort of stopped the last few pages that describe the event hinted out throughout the book were really good the delayed payoff coupled with really good writing bumped this up a notch","1388":"i read this in one sitting extremely engrossing but also a little unresolved as a huge fan of darnielle's voice literally and figuratively i was not disappointed with the plot or the writing i'm very much hoping he writes more novels and looking forward to reading them","1389":"first of all i am completely aware that this book was written beautifully and is filled with complex theories and questions regarding life itself it deserves more than three stars but it just isn't my type of novel i can appreciate an author being abstract and telling a story without actually telling the readers everything but i do start to get tired of that approach my favorite parts of this novel were when the author told concrete details about the main character the game the character crafted and the accident that started everything in motion this book is about a boy who is in some way injured injured to the point of a long recovery process that is spent attempting to not go insane which is remedied by creating games inside his head years after his accident he is making an income from his games and two people decide to play in real life they are hurt and he is forced to face his fault in that again i found parts of this novel interesting and the idea was incredibly unique but i wish i would have gotten more details about the way his parent's and friends were affected by the accident more details into the accident itself and more about the game itself even then again that's just the type of reader i am and i guess that sort of insight into the narrator's life wouldn't have made sense coming from the narrator's train of thoughts it wouldn't have fit his personality so i can respect the writing style it's a somewhat difficult read but i'm glad i finished","1390":"interesting way to tell a story it has a dark element but is told in a way that's not depressing","1391":"unique self contained truly brilliant disturbed will be thinking about this one for a long time absolutely take a minute to look up images of a trace italienne a star fort they are real and are amazing","1392":"this novel has a unique premise and voice and i really enjoyed reading it i just wish i had read it in a group because there is a lot to discuss after finishing i felt i knew more when i started then when it was over and i've been listening to the author's band ever since and i just don't know where i am anymore","1393":"very good the premise itself is one i'd tend to avoid a disfigured man running a fantasy game but the story is soaked with beautiful imagery and taps into my own sense memories in a way i'm not used to i wouldn't say i identify with the main character but he is well written and makes a kind of sense to me the novel is also a quick read i finished it in the drive from austin to dallas","1394":"i was sucked in by the mystery of it and the beautiful prose i was left wondering how the narrator transformed and what i took away from this journey","1395":"for my taste a boring story filled with underdeveloped characters told by an alienated angst ridden protagonist to whom i could not relate so what's left the narrative structure was interesting otherwise an ostensibly short book that turned into a plodding march to the finish","1396":"darnielle definitely has an imagination that's for sure i really liked the originality of the book however i felt it a little hard to follow where i was in the timeline past present trace italian game was a nice refreshing read","1397":"first this novel possessed me i could scarcely stand to put it down now that it's over it haunts me and will do so for some time to come there's much more to say but even more to think about","1398":"incredible read it in one sitting","1399":" wolf in white van is an interesting story told in the first person by sean the synopsis had me excited to be reading about real people taking sean's imaginary game out into the real world however the game was only a small part of the novel the main story being how sean and his family coped after his \"accident\" the story unfolds back in time but jumps around so much that at times i didn't exactly know what time in his life he was actually talking about i really didn't connect with sean at all and the story wasn't dark enough or desperate enough to warrant the ending if wolf in white van is meant to be a literary novel with deep meaning it was all lost on me i read a story about an ordinary teenage boy who survived an unfortunate incident with thanks to goodreads first reads and scribe for my uncorrected proof to read and review","1400":"don't waist your time what a bunch of derelict characters i thought maybe at some point this book would make a point not just a group of selfish backward people","1401":"what can i say man this book hit all the right notes for me and the only fault i can find is that it's too short because it was so short i went back and reread it immediately a first for me it's also a book that benefits greatly from the performance of the narrator in this case it's the author and his voice lends a soul to the main character that really brought the whole story to life it is a little bit of a dark book but it's the kind of dark that is so brutally honest that it doesn't seem like a bad kind of dark just a true kind of dark slight spoiler here view spoiler this is first time i've really understood enjoyed reading about suicide hide spoiler","1402":" this book is a more philosophical and less comical ready player one it has everything you'd expect from darnielle parent trouble in particular the real genius lies in the overlays between the game the main character creates after view spoiler trying to shoot himself hide spoiler and his psychological quirks his guilt and his thoughts about the future darnielle takes the post apocalyptic trend and asks where it comes from it's still fun still geeky but it has real social concern lying behind the game why do i get sad why do i hurt other people darnielle must've spent a good deal of time in some sort of care or someone close to him did because it feels real the way he's able to inhabit the main character's hermetic viewpoints is eerie i want to put this book on my favorites shelf but i'm kind of scared to because it's really dark it ends in a dark place it's also like denis johnson's train dreams in some ways i guess in the starkness the atmosphere the main character inhabits feels almost western at times he really is quite like the main character in the shootist too i hope darnielle continues to write both songs and novellas","1403":" the fact that i found the book's narrator sean to be so relatable is rather unsettling though i suspect that's by design it's a strange book that forgoes any attempts at telling a straight forward story and it's side tangents and distractions seem random at first only to slowly contribute to some main themes of the story overall still don't let this scare you away from the book it manages to escape the pretentiousness you might suspect based on some the other reviews or from the author's reputation as an songwriter","1404":" 8 5 10 wolf in white van is an incredibly intriguing and engrossing read our main character sean is the creator of a mail in role playing game called trace italian due to an accident as a teenager sean has a severe facial disfigurement causing him to lead a very reclusive life wolf in white van follows sean's life both before and after the accident as well as trace italian and its effects outside of the game one of the most interesting parts of the novel is that it doesn't follow a chronological timeline the story is broken up told in bits and pieces to allow information to be revealed just at the right moment to keep your curiosity alive wolf in white van is very mysterious and it keeps you wanting to read to piece together sean's story my personal favorite parts of the book are the ones that focus on trace italian this game that he has created is just so incredibly vast and interesting and i really enjoyed finding out more about it and how far people had gotten into the world honestly it just really made me want to play a game like this might have to search and try to find one however there are definitely reasons why i gave this book 8 5 instead of any higher to be honest i was between a 9 and an 8 5 so i went for the 8 5 due to my tendency to lower ratings eventually i tend to consider star ratings throughout the reading of a book and for the first half i was solidly in the 10 and 9 5 range i could tell that this book was a slow burning one and i was really enjoying the way that things were developing however it hit a point where i was no longer quite as invested i was still really enjoying it but that curiosity and drive to finish it were no longer there the other reason was character motivation i got to the end of the novel and felt that some of sean's choices just didn't make sense to me for those who have read the book view spoiler i really didn't understand sean's choice to shoot himself there didn't seem to be any real explanation for this decision or really any reason given for him to have done it so i felt that the decision didn't make sense hide spoiler perhaps this was purposeful and darnielle meant for the motivation to be ambiguous but i just really didn't like that about it and felt like it was important enough to be included overall despite a few shortcomings i thought that wolf in white van was a really engrossing read","1405":"this was a fascinating and engrossing book the narrative style drew you in and keeps you guessing knowing everything and knowing nothing all at once allows you to truly connect with the narrator and his experiences","1406":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the wolf is only in the van for maybe a chapter and a half the van doesn't stay white misleading title","1407":"there's something about this book that i wanted to like but it just ended up leaving me empty and not by design","1408":"i'm a big fan of john darnielle his lyrics are beautiful ugly and touch so many places in your soul that you didn't think another person outside yourself could adequately understand needless to say i had high expectations for this book darnielle delivers in so many ways the prose is beautifully written almost like a song i found myself wanting to highlight at least one passage a page the storyline is intriguing too darnielle skillfully dissects how nearly every teenager feels at some or many points in time those that ran with the 'outcasts' the 'weirdos' will especially be able to relate how close did we all come to making catastrophic decisions in our lives","1409":"a masterpiece reeling need time to sort my emotions out amazing","1410":"this book is everything someday i dream of writing a book this good his illustration of the human condition is unmatched his illustration of suicide and its thought process is beyond compare","1411":"3 5 stars the writing itself was fantastic in my opinion but i would have liked some more story","1412":" that moment when you finish a book you didn't especially enjoy but that everyone else loved so you give it three stars and feel like a fraud because it was really more of a two and a half star experience i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry you repeat hysterically i should've felt really deep things when i read this i swear i tried i just couldn't i have failed hey i like the mountain goats though and darnielle seems like a swell admirable guy forgive me i just kept thinking of chuck palahniuk and then that book about how we need to have a conversation about kevin and then john dies at the end because i can see how this might appeal to some people primarily people who are teenagers but it bores me to the point of run on sentences i don't connect i don't feel the feels","1413":"excellent a nice view into the psychotic without it getting gory","1414":"this is a terrific book about the internal void not a story of nerd depression and i don't know if others will understand that","1415":"this book is a bit weird i'm not sure how to feel about it sometimes it feels very sad but othertimes it's just so dark the main character's story is really complex and i will definitelly need to read it again anyways a very good read if you are into complex psychological plots re reading certain parts to be sure and if you enjoy weird songs no seriously","1416":"excellent john darnielle's ability to find the perfect metaphor to communicate a thought is astounding fans of tidy conclusions be warned this is a book of questions rather than answers trying to understand sean's actions is as difficult as his subscribers attempting to make their way into the trace italian but similar to the fictional rpg enjoyable entirely through the journey now if you will excuse me i must go and devour the mountain goats' discography and wonder why i didn't sooner","1417":" i expected to either love or hate this book but wound up just liking it i'm a huge fan of john darnielle's work with the indie band the mountain goats so i was nervous about picking up a full length work of fiction that he'd written but i learned that he's not just a good lyricist he's a good writer period and wolf in white van gives me some insight into the gaming obsessives with which i have only a vague familiarity but where his songs are passionate and specific his prose is ambivalent and evocative which means he's versatile but this particular facet of his talent is a bit frustrating the story which is highly non linear is about sean a designer of a role playing game who either attempted suicide or had a horribly disfiguring accident with a shotgun even though sean narrates the book he never makes it clear gradually we learn that sean is dealing with the fact that the fantasy he needs to survive is a threat to other people interesting but not gripping but i'll sure pick up his next album and or book","1418":"wolf in the white van is my favorite kind of book excellent writing interesting premise and quick read i highly recommend it","1419":"sometimes i just don't get the appeal nominated for a 2014 national book award why","1420":" john darnielle of the mountain goats has crafted a series of perplexing but strangely captivating worlds both real and imagined in his debut novel wolf in white van world's that we the reader are offered tantalizing samples of without ever being given a full course through a collage of memory observation and expert narration darnielle places readers into the mind of sean the grown survivor of a traumatic teenage accident that destroyed a good portion of his face now forced into a life of seclusion the world appears very different through sean's eyes than it would through most of ours in the aftermath of his experience sean crafts his own world--a subscription only turn based fantasy adventure game called the trace italian--where he can elopse from the pressures of reality with subscribers who engage in a series of quests in an attempt to navigate a post apocalyptic world the goal to find sanctuary in the trace italian a paradisaical safe house somewhere in the vast expanse of kansas when two of the trace's adolescent players end up dead though--killed by their own hands in attempt to bring the trace italian into reality--sean's world comes crashing down around him and he is forced to explore the power of his own imagination to both destroy and heal the world the strength of darnielle's work is in the prose darnielle has a way with words that is simultaneously simple yet highly addictive digging into your brain like a fishhook and all but daring you to tear yourself away from the narrative","1421":" i loved the part about the trace italian but found sean's backstory extremely dark i suppose it was intended to be that way that said it was so dark that i needed to take breaks also i listened to the audiobook narrated by john darnielle which was great most importantly the book provided the rich lush description that you might expect from john darnielle if you know him as a songwriter but it was such a different world that even if you hated the book i don't think it would ruin the music for you","1422":" i was introduced to wolf in white van by john darnielle because i started listening to the podcast nate corddry presents reading aloud and it was the first book club selection for the podcast it's the story of sean a man disfigured as a teen who creates a game based on an imaginary world and players are directed through the game by mailing sean their moves and then getting their next clue move mailed to them by sean strangely the story moves between past and present while at the same time the overarching storyline moves from present to the past with the last chapter revealing the truth about the disfigurment this was nothing like anything i've ever read before and i found myself deeply intrigued but when i turned the last page i felt myself dissatisfied because i needed more answers what happened to the surviving member of a pair of players who took sean's game to the real world and went too far did sean participate in the new treatment to help graft him a new face and most importantly why why did he do it maybe my head doesn't have dark enough corners for this story but i felt just as puzzled by sean's motivations after the explanation as i was before i look forward to listening to the episode of the podcast to hear what others thought of the book","1423":"this almost novella is haunting dark and disturbing darnielle's use of structure is tight and rewarding in its pace and in the way he teases and rewards with pieces of the storyline he gets you into the head of the troubled and disturbed protagonist and its quite absorbing while darnielle might tend to use of simile a bit too much his prose is beautiful it's quite a short novel though and i wanted more and would have been happy to go along for this scary ride a bit further","1424":"humm it was a little hard to get into for about a chapter or two then i will say i was fairly hooked not a very long read but a pretty deep one i got a real catcher in the rye sense from it and kind of feel like it is sort of a modern turn on it deeply emotional and something that can be identified with on a personal level the more i think about it the more i like it","1425":"wow wow wow my head is spinning a stunningly grim debut novel the praise is well deserved 4 5","1426":"really enjoyed this dark meditation on the power of fantasy and escape sure to be appreciated by fans of darnielle or nerd rpg subcultures looking forward to his visit to our local university to talk about the book","1427":" i first learned of this book a couple of years ago in austin texas it was a highlighted book front center at book people the wonderful famous bookstore standing next to another customer he told me how much he loved the book and had read it twice the more the guy talked i was sure it wasn't a book for me not bring much into games but i enjoyed the strangers excitement anyway later i remember seeing the book begin to pop up on goodreads with varied ratings i don't remember paying too much attention to lots of reviews i might have read a couple but if i had i couldn't remember what this book was about when i downloaded the audiobook it was available from my library on a day i was out for a long walk what a surprise the audiobook pulls you in immediately this is another example where the voice narration was so hypnotic that somehow i can't imagine reading the physical book to be better right away we know there was some type of awful accident we are curious what type of accident why is this person coming in and out of hospitals being carried by his father an adult a child we are hooked the unfolding of the narration keeps us on our toes we don't want to miss a thing i even started to want to know about this game and i am not a game player but it's creative and actually really engaging i cared about sean philips you can't help but love this guy it's a powerful story and damn another book very hard to stop thinking about i never expected to like this book thank you to the new world of audiobook's i gave it a try and am glad i did","1428":"i wanted to love it more than i did and maybe i will in the future but for now i really liked it though i feel that i missed something critical ambiguity for ambiguity's sake is trouble","1429":"i finished this a while ago but i've been trying and failing to come up with something to say other than it's great and you should read it this really isn't like any other book i've read the tragedy of it is almost unfathomable to me but it's presented in such a calm everyday voice that you could almost pretend there's no tragedy at all i really don't know what to say it's a great book","1430":"i liked the formatting of this book each chapter moves backward in time we learn the outcome of sean's trial before we understand exactly what he's on trial for we see the physicality of his scars before we learn what he did to earn them and we never move back far enough in time to understand his true motivations for acting out in that fashion there were also some great lines examples under the spoiler tag view spoiler 'why did you need shelter ' somethings are hard to explain to your parents some things are hard to explain period but your parents especially are never going to understand them i save the best parts of myself and savor them in silence i guess no matter what your circumstances are you drift at some point from feeling like you're one of the young people to feeling like some of them could be your own kids hide spoiler","1431":" wolf in white van feels like it was written by chuck palahniuk's more inscrutable younger brother i'm not quite as sold on the book as others seem to be but i dig the prose and the attention to detail in the by mail rpg at the same time i accepted that most of this short book felt odd and out of focus with the understanding that the end would cast everything in a new light but the end was exactly what the beginning clearly alluded to if it was meant to be a twist it would rank closer to signs or the village than the sixth sense on the m night scale","1432":"a disturbing and mysterious book wrapped up in a game world the reverse chronology was really interesting and worked well for it and the sheer mystery and slow unveiling of the protagonist's life was really intriguing i really enjoyed it","1433":"i enjoyed the writing but was waiting the whole time for something more to happen i thought it was set up well with the parallel to his game but it never really manifested into anything meaningful beyond a social outcast who was lonely and searching for some connection oh well i guess that is enough to make a pretty good book but apparently not quite enough for 5 stars","1434":" this book was breathtaking in its execution it definitely had me from the very first moment i started it and it didn't let go i would have loved it no matter what probably just because it goes so in depth into the creation of other universes other worlds by talking about how to run a fantasy campaign like du0026amp d there's something magical to me about those kinds of worlds how they spring from the dungeon master's head fully formed how they develop and grow as you explore and grow i loved these characters i knew these characters i wanted to reach into the pages and talk to them but at the same time i had that feeling i get sometimes when i'm reading of not wanting to disturb their forward momentum of knowing that if it were possible to break that wall and talk to fictional characters it would change the path they're on and i don't want them to wander off of that path i want to see where it leads them i've always loved john darnielle's writing as a lyricist and i'm now even more entranced by his writing i'd love to see what else he creates and honestly i'd love to know what happens to these characters next it's rare these days for a book to leave me unsettled at the end wishing i could know more and wanting to make sure they characters are ok but this one does feel that way...like i want to be able to check on them from time to time just to make sure everything is running smoothly this was passed onto me by my friend alex and so i'll pass it on to someone else who i know will understand and care for the people in it","1435":"i love that i still can't figure out whether i'm sympathetic towards sean or find him completely untrustworthy i also love that it's a story in reverse","1436":"recommended by kim check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","1437":"for all the high ratings this novel got i just couldn't get into it i read it and re read it and still came up short maybe it was the complex literary style the way the story bounces back and forth from reality to fantasy in the end i just felt dissatisfied","1438":"this book was recommended to me by one of my dearest friends and so it went directly to the top of my reading list i can't wait to call her tomorrow and talk to her about what she saw in it because whatever it was i don't see it this may be partly my fault as i went into the novel totally blind and for quite a while because of the title i was waiting for something sinister to happen i thought this was going to be a book either about a predator or his prey you see and the narrator does do several odd things early in the story that sort of seemed to support my assumption i'm thinking particularly about the scene with the young boy in the park but this isn't that book this is a strange sentimental story about loneliness and connection the danger and the appeal of living in a fantasy world in a very real sense it's also a story of a tragic monster although that interpretation will strike many as cruel there's a bunch of other stuff too television and bad parenting and mental illness ultimately it didn't quite work for me the synopsis which i've now read calls this book brilliantly structured i have to disagree it's messily structured in my opinion and essentially plotless there is a lovely vivid scene in a liquor store parking lot that almost earned an extra star from me but it's just not enough to support even a book as slender as this one","1439":"loved the way this was written but it tended to drag on","1440":"i want to play trace italian","1441":"i gave wolf in white van 4 stars it's really more like 4 5 it's been awhile since i read a book with such masterful writing it's dark it's human it's something totally different than what i usually pick up but i'm certainly glad i did i'll be thinking about this one for awhile","1442":"i can see the craft of this book but i don't think i was in the right place to read this book and feel all of its depth possibly it needs more focus than i was able to give it i don't know but it didn't hit me on the way it has affected others oh well","1443":"a short frustrating shadowy grim but poetic visit with a loner a disfigured fantasy obsessed creator of a mail in role playing game who lives in an alternate world of his own design a world in which each move opens up a increasingly more complex choice of paths i'm still not completely sure what to make of it but i'm certain that it will haunt me for a while think perhaps a cross between catcher in the rye and ready player one if such a hybrid is possible i can't say much more without spoiling it but i'd recommend it as a quick if troubling read","1444":"probably 3 5 stars i liked this a bunch and obv it's john darnielle so parts of it are beautifully written but i feel like it was missing something only i'm not really sure what i think perhaps more of an ending there was absolutely no closure for any of the characters and i'm very much the sort of person who really needs closure gets a little intense in parts but it's a decent read snippets of this kept making me think of truth or dare by celia rees which is a book i have a lot of fondness for so that's no bad thing","1445":"a truly creepy extremely well crafted novel i couldn't put it down it's a wondrous blend of horror fantasy and realism unlike many ya novels i did not see every plot turn pages in advance and was kept guessing it's a tragic study on the ways we kill one another and how we survive i loved it","1446":" this is a deceptively clever book the book itself is a game parallel to the games within the book and we the readers are on a quest to solve the puzzle just as the players in the book are and the puzzle for the reader never revealed in fact deliberately withheld is why did sean do it as with the trace italian there are many red herrings gaddafi the guy who backed into the car etc that lead nowhere but there are 7 clues that i believe lead to the solution the first two are sean's lines i did something terrible to his son as he feels for his dad and i was going to be lonely anyway to his mum these two revelations lead to the big third clue which is that sean at no stage showed or expressed remorse for his action the other four clues are that the exit wound was near his nose the shooting happened within hours of his dalliance with kimmy his complex reactions to chris and his disinterest in the latest surgical procedures that would dramatically improve his appearance sean is a gamer by personality and philosophy he sees life as a continual series of options the decisions on which will either lead him further forward or backward in the game of life just as in his trace italian game he is an outsider alienated from the mainstream who felt misunderstood and knew he wouldn't fit into the outside world i was going to be lonely anyway his parents good people whom he respected had conventional expectations of him that he knew he'd have trouble fulfilling he was happy enough and liked being different he liked being the only one who liked certain musicians but he didn't like people not liking him being different so what better strategy at this point in his life game than to become a mutant where no expectations apply and where he can honour his weirdness and actually flaunt it at the world it is an honourable out but only an honourable out for himself not for those he loved that's why he says he did something terrible to his dad's son because it wasn't something terrible to himself it was never attempted suicide let alone a pact which is why he laughed at his dad for suggesting it not clarifying either as he doesn't in his games this also being a game his intention was always self mutilation which is why the exit wound was near his nose he shot outwards from his mouth through his cheek he wanted to destroy his face but not his brain which he would need for the next stages of his life game the second problem his self mutilation addressed was his homosexuality his sexual dalliance with kimmy went wrong at no point did he describe it other than mechanically he is very capable of expressing emotion but he expressed no emotion about that night with kimmy that was the night he pulled the trigger meanwhile he was attracted sexually to chris his heart missed a beat and he became flustered and flushed on nearly encountering him in person reading chris's moves made parts of himself manifest in the room he had a thought about chris's admissions before i could stop myself from thinking it i e guilt inducing thoughts about forbidden fruit so by becoming hideous and unpartnerable he also nullifies the heterosexual expectations of his conventional parents his annoyance with them was only for their not understanding him and for being disappointable he still wanted and needed their love which is why he was so proud when his dad looked at him as though he were a grownup this book is a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a conundrum when you start reading it's as though you've walked into a movie 15 minutes in you look for clues in a desperate attempt to catch up with other viewers a good approach because the real clues are there the prose is assured resigned and pragmatic there are elegant insights there is something fierce and starved about first ideas mum found the quiet mask from which her face would never fully emerge again and the whole concept is touched by genius","1447":"surprisingly deliciously good","1448":"on the list for the national book award wolf in white van is a short novel about imagination and alienation written by the lead singer of indie band the mountain goats but this isn't just some side project wolf is worthwhile focusing on sean a teenager disfigured from a violent accident who creates his own intricate world in the game called trace italian think dungeons and dragons with each turn played by letters in the mail weird and moving and unique","1449":"i'm sure there are tons of deep takeaways and metaphors in this book but for me it didn't work it just fell so flat i had to force myself daily just to pick it up and it was only 200 pages gave the second star solely because of the structure and timeline of the storytelling","1450":" an incredible debut novel by john darnielle aka the mountain goats knowing his lyrics i expected it to be good but wolf in white van surpassed my expectations without giving too much away i will say that it speaks directly to people who live inside inside their own heads and shows how certain things we do that affect others sometimes have no real explanation behind them the situation of the main character is extreme but the general feelings he expresses will be familiar to many definitely one to read and think about for a long time","1451":" some notes i've never listened to the mountain goats so i'm here with no pre conceived desire to love or hate this book i kind of felt like this was more of a character sketch than a complete story but i'm a ok with that it might even be preferable like the game the character creates there's a heavy focus on the internal and while i don't feel like i was ever lost as to what was happening i'm also betting i didn't unpack everything there is to unpack this book is only around 200 pages but there's some density there without it ever feeling dense sean feels like a fully realized person like someone you could meet in real life without the book allowing you to fully understand him i would totally play trace italian","1452":"interesting and sad story about one moment leading to an entire life lived on the fringes of society forming social bonds only with people playing his game through the mail beautifully written","1453":"not an easy book to read and in some ways not a lot happens in other ways this book is a microcosm of life and everything happens because choices this was purposely cryptic i don't recommend this book even though i enjoyed reading it i don't see this as a book for the masses not because it's beyond anyone or anything because it's a subtle with a ton of meaning but not a lot of action","1454":"i had come through the day no worse off than i had come to it which as i had been telling myself for many years now is a victory whether it feels like one or not wolf in white van is so beautifully written it's hard to believe this is his debut novel","1455":"if you liked this book you might also enjoy looking for jakehow they were foundwe were liars","1456":"the main character in this book is traveling in the maze of his teenage psyche somewhere between du0026amp d master and auggie from wonder he is a fascinating incarnation of human isolation but in the end i would have liked the narrative more with a clearer timeline and a tighter resolution of the subplots","1457":" it's hard to put in words why i can't give this five stars because i loved it hated putting it down at night and waiting for my next reading window was so impressed with the concepts and themes and structure and voice and had such an immediate connection with both the rpg and the mail order aspects i mean basically this is one of those the book you didn't even know you were waiting for books for me i think maybe just it was too dark to be best thing ever which is weird because it has such genuine hope grace and is basically a story of a person growing into equanimity so yeah that isn't why either i just really feel four star about it","1458":" closer to a 4 5 i think i might try to write a sentence or two after i read a thing to practice having coherent thoughts this book worked for me because it spent a lot of time with the mundane while treating a sensational subject i'm a sucker for that kind of approach i wanted the walking dead to be a good television show badly because i thought the longer format of a series might lead to something more interesting in dealing with the mundane matters than you can get in a 120 minutes or less feature film turns out that was foolish this provides everything i wanted out of that show without the zombies and in a very short format so the rating is probably idiosyncratically high for that reason","1459":"i got caught up in this book darnielle is known for his lyrics and the style of this book definitely had a lyric element to it that just caught me i gulped this down over the course of three sessions and really enjoyed it the plot was slightly lacking but the narrative was thoroughly engaging","1460":"a beautiful if tricky book not the easiest of read despite its length complex lyrical moving without depressing and with this irrepressible desire where you wish it never ends it's not an easy book although it is a fairly quick read i managed it in under three hours i'm not quite sure the novel resolves itself but in the context of the narrative i don't think it ever could have a part of me wants to go back and re read it and another feels i should leave it to be","1461":"i'm kind of floored by how much i enjoyed this book after not picking it up for a few weeks and then barreling through it no real plot or character development just a bizarre tension that climbs and climbs read the last 50 pages obsessively","1462":" 3 5 starsi really enjoyed this debut novel but ultimately it didn't quite bring all the creative ideas to a satisfying conclusion the concept of a grotesquely wounded young man dreaming up a turn by turn game as a distraction from his pain and rehab was very promising and mostly hit the mark the creative core of the book the game trace italian is genius the passages of the book relating to the game were the most enjoyable intriguing and engrossing particularly the relationship between sean and his players the constant time shifting could've been toned down and while the fractious nature of sean's relationship with his parents is exposed it's not fully explained in the end i wasn't in tune with the main character's motivation to do what he did so the ending felt strangely unsatisfying for what had been a very enjoyable story up to that point kind of like listening to a cracking concept album but with a dud final track however i really want to give the author points for having a go at such a creative story and like i said i was absorbed by the trace italian","1463":"wolf in a white van by john darnielle was pretty surprising to me because i had no idea that the author was the lead singer of the mountain goats and because it was a pretty depressing book you're kind of wondering where the writer was mentally when he decided to write it the story is about a young man sean who creates a game about a post apocalyptic world and he invites magazine subscribers to partake in their own survival within it it's basically like those choose your own adventure type books where a question is asked about a situation and you can only choose one option out of four scenarios to determine your next step within the story you discover that he created this game while undergoing some physical and mental hardship because of a disfiguring accident through this game sean is connected to people in the external world but they're people that he'll never meet or really want to the game is actually just the background story to what is really a tale about sean's personal thoughts on life what people think of him or his imagination there is also a lack of other characters in the story because in essence the story is really just about sean the accident which is a big part of the story is something the reader will never understand why it happened other than the sad reality of someone that someone being sean being confined to their own thoughts and feeling depressed the book was a long personal gentle confession of ambiguity a lot of whys are asked but no answers provided i thought this was a unique portrayal of someone dealing with depression at least that was my take on it if at first you do pick this book up and it seems slow give yourself some time because there is a good story within the pages","1464":" considering that i like john darnielle's lyrics i was disappointed with wolf in white van the plot was interesting a disfigured boy sean creates a game in which people mail him the directions he then discovers that two fans have taken his game too seriously and suffer drastic consequences as the novel progresses the reader finds out about how the disfigurement took place and the events after plus other plotholes are tied up in theory i should like this book but i found darnielle's writing to be similar to chuck palahniuk a style which bothers me i find it too deadpan and that lessened my enjoyment of the novel like i said earlier though the ideas are great but i found everything else a bit so so at times","1465":"if this is the best prose one of the finest lyricists of his generation can produce i strongly suggest that he stick to his undoubtedly mildly oblique indy rock whining","1466":"great book dealing with themes of childhood memory and imagination felt similar to early chuck palahniuk in its obsession with details and esoteric subjects beautifully lyrical prose huge fan of the mountain goats but loving the band is not a prerequisite to loving this novel","1467":"i almost gave up early on page 9 because this book isn't a typical pick for me at all glad i kept going because it's one i won't forget felt for sean and his story is so personal loved the author's slow unwinding but perfect pacing","1468":" sean horribly disfigured has locked himself away from the outside world and created an unusual game for subscribers played via mail called trace italian strikingly imaginative and dark the twists and turns of trace italian are mirrored in the maze of sean's own imagination throughout the book we learn about the game and in reverse learn about sean the lawsuit brought by the parents of a young role player sean's formation of the game and finally the reason for his disfigurement i couldn't put this one down","1469":"i was really interested in reading this because darnielle is probably the greatest song writer that ever lived while i was happy with how he transitioned from a lyricist to an author i just couldn't stand the story itself i look forward to reading his future books at least","1470":"this book got a lot of good buzz but it never really grabbed me like i never completely bought the narrator as authentic it was always the writer speaking through the narrator a kid with his face blown off from a botched suicide attempt even so there were a few great lines that made me go wow","1471":"magnificent book overall the plot is captivating and over and over again i was struck by how nuanced it truly was the prose at times felt heavy perhaps darnielle being unused to a larger format for his generally cuttingly concise storytelling but nonetheless hands down a worthwhile quick read","1472":"to describe this book as disturbing is a bit like saying that the battle of hastings was violent something dreadful has happened to sean and he has been left severely injured i am not going to tell you what as the whole plot pivots around this event and i don't think that i can tell you why because i am not sure of that myself what i can tell you is that john darnielle holds you enthralled as the story develops in all its grisly detail you will want to put the book down but you will not be able to you may want to be sick but you will not have the time because you want to find out what happens and the poetry of the writing will keep you spellbound john darnielle is obviously an author to watch and this is very definitely a book that people should read","1473":"effing weird book very compelling but i can't say i enjoyed reading it i wanted more straightforward answers even though the style and vagueness worked for the book","1474":"it took me about 50 pages to get into it but it's a hawt little book you get the sense that jd is torn aesthetically the book isn't but you can tell he probably grapples with his love for the literary and his love for things genre swords devils conan and i am deeply sympathetic to this split affinity it's essentially the stranger if mersault was a dungeons and dragon dork with a fucked up face and if he'd shot himself rather than an arab in algiers and if he lived with the ramifications of his actions and had to wrestle with all that bad move impulsivity can't wait to see what jd does next honestly","1475":"i wanted to like this book after reading the description and reviews i thought this would be the book for me but sadly not so much what started with much promise left me bored i re read the reviews but it seems that what makes this book so great is the world is creates perhaps i should have given it more time but this wasn't quite the book i was expecting","1476":"woah i just finished reading this book in less than a day amazing writing confusing at first but makes sense once you get into it i can't say i enjoyed the book but wow i know i will be thinking about it for a long time","1477":"lovely and sad prose i enjoyed the structure which circled and went back and forth in remembrances but wished that a lot of the narrative tension hadn't been drained early on","1478":"this book is awesome like the game trace italian the book itself is labyrinthine spiraling through time with glimpses of narrative you must pull together to construct the actual plot no stranger to many of the issues his protagonist is grappling with darnielle has created a stunning voice through which he tells this story sean is infinitely sympathetic and visceral even in his darkest moments","1479":"what a book compelling devastating funny rich and refreshing in the inventiveness of its conceit darnielle has created a character unlike any i have encountered one who has stayed with me long after the book was over excellent","1480":"a hypnotic book with a untrustworthy narrator the story interspersed with moves in a roleplaying game is captivating until the very last word i felt like the book did end a bit abruptly but this novel is the very example of the journey being better than the destination highly recommended especially if you like creepy stories","1481":"just great and complicated and sad and disturbing in all the right ways","1482":" well this book was more depressing than i thought it was going to be and i mean i wasn't expecting a jolly book what with the premise of a guy who tried to commit suicide but there was just too much left unresolved i could definitely tell a musician wrote this there was poetry in the words it was often sad but it was emotional in the way that good sad songs are the \"plot\" was confusing at best i was never really sure what were the important parts but i liked the lyrical text and the musings about life this whole book was an exploration of \"l'appel de vide\" the \"call of the void\" where you have an impulse to do something like jump off a building or crash your car what would happen if you made that strongest choice well in this story it turns out kinda bad and the whole book explores the results of actually acting out those impulses it was weird and unsatisfying but i think that was the point","1483":"don't think this book was for me the plot if there was one was very disjointed it was the longest a 200 book has ever taken me to read","1484":"this book was much better than i expected","1485":" the very best part for me was trace italian a deeply appealing richly imagined world that i wish i could explore and participate in the rest of the book i'd class as very good but not transcendent for me anyway sean is the type of character who could easily inhabit a mountain goats song and like in a mountain goats song the plot here is revealed somewhat obliquely i would have appreciated a bit more elaboration at some points given that we are dealing with a novel and not a three minute song at a reading i attended darnielle mentioned that there had been a previous draft with multiple narrators and with that in mind i wish i'd been able to see more into the interior lives of characters besides sean still i thought the book was excellent and absolutely worth reading","1486":"love the mountain goats and mr john darnielle totally not disappointed by this novel please keep writing more books","1487":"read #1 wolf in white van okay what is going on here firstly we can confirm that this is not a book about action but about themes nothing really happens and you get why this book is intended to be internal a book of questions not of storylines what are the questions what are the themes let's see does there have to be meaning behind every action to what extent are the powers of imagination saving and destructive something about there being something dark within us all i don't know this book is kind of difficult to crack meaning from but you can sense it's there it feels religious in its scope and exploration but i'm not absolutely certain how i don't know if it's intended or whether it matters if it's intended but in my head the trace italian reflects religious promises of salvation something imaginary something that will never be reached but something that may nevertheless save in different fashions on one level imagination in this book seems to be about mere escapism a defence mechanism but on the other hand it seems to be an allegory for the stories of religion and the deep anchor they can be for people the book was beautifully written and as a person who feels like he is constantly battling to get from the outside in as i'm sure many other people feel too it was easy to identify with sean however i must admit that i didn't fully get the book reading it felt like trying to look at something beautiful through stained glass i suppose this means i need to re read it return to it with more vigour to unlock its meaning maybe someday 3 75 read #2 after a re read of this book i guess i'd like to come back at the review try to say a few more words i think i caught some of the themes the first time around the book seems to me principally to be about the breakdown between fiction and real life how the meaning of fiction stretches out from the page into the real world into an actual thing in the actual present physical world the different manifestations this can take from chris haynes who plays the trace earnestly and fevered but knows when to back out to the couple lance and carrie who do not to sean who straddles a place somewhere in between sean is something else a fictional character that represents both the deep meaning we can conjure that turns into manifest reality from things that existed only in unreal places but also the fact of them being unreal unanchored possibly meaningless or at least without reason wolf in white van a construct created by scared christians not real but there rising from the actual sounds in a backwards playing record all the same affecting people feelings thoughts it's not perfectly crafted their are some unnecessarily indulgent moments like itineraries of the route to the trace i think that take up pages and pages and pages although it detracted from the flow and enjoyment of the novel those long lists of place names that went on forever it's kind of apropos that the author has gotten so sucked into his fiction that he forgets the outside world the feeling of his readers but yeah good book definitely something you can find lots in and is worth multiple re reads 4 5 this time","1488":"john darnielle and the mountain goats played a major part in my formative years it was the music that marked my graduation from high school and first year of college i've dipped back into their library from time to time but never in the way i did at that time it was an awkward transformation from the much more shy bookish high school kid to slightly less shy freedom enjoying college freshman one of my first writing assignments in college was an analysis of a song of our choice i picked all up the seething coast the mountain goats were always a form of escapism for me flowery and at times sing song displays of grief and dysfunction it was a realm i had the privilege of not knowing first hand and a level of wordplay i felt completely beyond my grasp it's fitting then that wolf in white van is a story of escape throwing yourself into an idea drowning out the world with which you feel disconnected with fantastic tales and stewing in a general teenage funk of i don't know while the vast majority of us don't feel pain and isolation to the extent sean does we all came down our own paths through the rigors of young adulthood darnielle delves deep into this murky world but he leaves just enough ambiguous to really grip you like depression this story gradually lays itself upon you so that you don't realize the shadowy weight looming over you until you have no choice but to reckon with it","1489":" this is one of the best books i have read in 2014 although some have compared the reverse chronology narrative to memento i think it bears more resemblance to the back masked messages that give the book its title i'd like to write a lot more about this but as it's a slim book that more about depth of character than action i'd hate to spoil the end suffice it to say that i was very moved by the idea of the healing role that fantasy worlds and personal creativity have on people who feel alienated and alone like memento or irreversible however i don't think this book would have the same impact if told in chronological order the resonance of the story comes from knowing the end before we know the choices that got the narrator to that point the journey being much more important here than the goal wonderfully done side note i might have to go check out the mountain goats now i've never even heard of this band","1490":" deeply unsettling and beautiful i feel like i read this too quickly like i should have lingered in the words to soak in the uncomfortable pauses the words danced around i've been a fan of tmg for over a lot of years now and when i got my copy of wolf in white van signed at a reading a couple of weeks ago the only words that i could say to him were thank you for bringing light to dark places jd exposes the uncomfortable truth of humanity and at the same time brings hope that there is another way he lifts up the idea that we have the choice of finding connections with others","1491":"disfigured recluse runs a rpg through the mail beautifully written i really loved this book","1492":"3 5 stars i enjoyed this it was a nice snapshot into loneliness mental illness and memory my biggest complaint is that i felt like this book just scratched the surface of what could have been a really dark complex story there was never really that much mystery around the lance carrie situation and while i felt like it was building towards something with the ending it never really delivered towards the end i did find the music movie game descriptions pretty tedious but overall i enjoyed darnielle's writing and story structure","1493":"a rare read and not a book for everyone complex dark and yet the world is strangely comforting taking you back to a time in youth that i remember so well darnielle captures the isolation and secrecy of those teenage years perfectly the teenage half formed mind so intense in its thought and yet so fragile i'm a little heartbroken for teenagers everywhere","1494":"this book surrounded me it felt personal and close i reread sentences over and over again just to savor them read this book","1495":"about 4 5 stars","1496":"not bad but i really wanted to love this","1497":" this is not an easy book rather this is a book that provides great rewards to patient and diligent readers it begins so cryptically that it is almost impossible to follow and enjoy midway through the second chapter almost any reader who has made it that from will be completely hooked i read the entire book in one day simply because i had to john darnielle's brilliant prose and bold non linear structure made me unable to put this down the novel unravels like a deep maze revealing our greatest fears along the way it's almost like a modern choose your own adventure where you don't actually get to make the choices but the illusion of choice is always there as you get deeper into the this strange world you realize just how clear everything is and clarity makes the world take on a whole new depth read this you won't be disappointed unless you really want to be","1498":"while moving and beautiful in a sad way this book was hard to follow i believe the author purposely inverse the plot which did make it powerful but also caused confusion unfortunately","1499":" a freaking masterpiece a philosophical study of the choices and paths that we all have available of the infinite possibilities of our lifetime like the game trace italian we face dead ends days of waiting in a holding pattern and although death is possible we are more likely to survive an alternate reality born in the mind of someone with no other place to live trace italian can take over your true existance but only if you let it one player is strong enough to take himself out when he realizes this two others do not have the same willpower sean has found a way to connect with others that isn't technological and gives him some purpose and enjoyment and belonging for many others an unimaginable life gives us a glimpse down a path we hope we never have to travel this could be read over and over and layers and layers would reveal themselves","1500":" i'd rate this 3 5 stars this book has an intriguing plot is written well and is engaging from the get go however i can't shake the fact that so many parts of the book are left unanswered things that seem integral in forming latter parts of the story are introduced reexamined a bit deeper and then never revisited this did keep me reading as i wanted to know more about these sub plots and why how they formed the overall plot i'd recommend this book if you like introspective first person stories that deal with the human condition it's not going to blow your mind but it will leave you ruminating for some time after reading","1501":"this book drags you into the darkest recesses of teenage angst and forces you to feel it all through the numbness it's probably more of a 4 5 just because i wish there was some specific moment of revelation of some kind in the story to track and understand sean's journey but that's a minor gripe because the whole thing both was and wasn't a moment of revelation which to me was kind of the point","1502":"i didn't get it as a bookseller i was intrigued by the sudden popularity of this title i'm guessing it was popular because the author is a musician not for any literary reason did like the title and overall book design","1503":"i have two essays due in on monday which i've barely made any inroads on so obviously now was the perfect time to get caught up in this book","1504":"i found this book to be a complete mess it was very difficult for me to force my way through 207 pages the worst book i've read in quite some time","1505":"has those killer mountain goats lines and as haunting as you'd expect from darnielle","1506":"highly meditative and short on actual scenes i can tell something impressive is happening here but i was far from entertained but i do adore the mountain goats and i find it odd that i get more narrative satisfaction from a 3 minute song than a 200 page book altogether a very big shrug","1507":"i devoured this book in one sitting a maze unto itself it unfolds redirects and compels its reader forward searching for an end you're not sure exists i loved the protagonist in the way that i love to love protagonists not love hate so much as love disgusted love frustrated love identify he is hard to look at both his face and his soul we are left with questions upon questions leading me to want to mail in my own next move to the author to reach some safe haven in the narrative where all things are known and resolved one of the best novels i've read in a year of disappointing debuts five stars","1508":"i think i should've trusted my instincts and stopped reading early on instead of finishing this despite all the amazing reviews i was disappointed i kept reading on just because of the locations mentioned in the book upland montclair plaza etc the authors a local guy give him some slack the reason for the second star i'm glad i'm done with this book so i can go on to one that's more up my alley","1509":"i alternately loved and hated this which i choose to believe is a good thing even if you don't like where the story ultimately goes you have to admit that darnielle wrote the living hell out of it also the fact that there are reviewers that view this protagonist as so emotionally morally bankrupt that they see no repercussions in acting out in destructive ways rather than as a story of mental illness terrifies me i hope they never have children","1510":"john darnielle's talent dare i say genius is taking the admittedly gratifying outsider gets revenge story or the sequel - unnoticed becomes noticed through violent means and making it less clear cut more human sean is not a character eternally consumed by rage or frustration and his fixation on fantasy seems a longing for the cruel but clear world of binary morality and total conviction sean is 3 dimensional real alive because he is at once remarkably kind and empathetic and capable of destroying lives in some ways he is ignorant beyond hope and in others understanding beyond all expectation through it all one thing is clear he is not evil or noble hero nor villain he is not conan the barbarian read the full review here http www wakethedeaf co uk 2014 11","1511":" it's a story about a mutilated young man who in his isolated state takes his imagination to terrifying places that eventually spell doom for the people around him in this sense wolf in white van very much reminded me of iain banks' the wasp factory but wolf does that semi classic one better he takes out some of the blood and guts though there are plenty of wet face skin flaps here to shock those who are into that sorta thing and puts in a very strange very realistic human heart the book is ridiculously well written full of graceful sentences and beautifully sketched scenes but all of darnielle's skill is mostly in service of pain a special pain though torture porn this is not his pages are infused with agony guilt fear anxiety and regret but the book never becomes the sort of freak show that narrator sean phillips a conan fan might like it to be no wolf is even more haunting because here things are actually at stake there are real lives in the balance and real drama to be found this is a great book that i read much too quickly i intend to read it again sometime","1512":"fascinatingly weird","1513":"this book is one of the rare masterpieces that is able to completely envelop you in the mind of someone else it takes you on a journey through a mind that perhaps more accurately than anyone might want to admit reflects both the dark and the light sides of human existence as the story unfolds it draws you further into the complexities that exist within people and makes you think about the nature of memory and of possibility","1514":"if i was going to put a trigger warning on anything this book would be it i found it really hard to read more horrifying than most of jd's stuff and weirdly less empathetic than his earlier 3 1 2 black sabbath book left it feeling confused and weirdly negative uncharacteristically so also we're totally going to run trace italian for roleplaying hell yes it's gonna be awesome","1515":"a really weird book and not really in a good way you wait a long time to find out what happened and it's rather unsatisfying i finished it but barely","1516":"there was such hype for this book but it fell flat for me the ending was good but the beginning was hard to get through","1517":"i just don't get it why all the glowing reviews why was this written up in entertainment weekly was it because the author is in a band did they read the same book one of the worst books i have read in the past few years plot jumps back and forth from present to past in irritating ways it centers around a guy who tried to kill himself when a teenager and the aftermath the entire book is pointless there are so many books out there i try to choose carefully usually a book with an average review over 4 on goodreads is considered safe in my eyes maybe they read a different book waste of time avoid","1518":"this book received good reviews on npr so i gave it a try and found it difficult to get into i must have missed what everyone else found so riveting about this book","1519":"foreshadowing small reveal foreshadowing small reveal foreshadowing indulgent blather the end at last it filled the unreliable narrator spot in my book bingo","1520":"a for affort","1521":"i don't think i can be objective about this book since i wanted so badly to love the book as much as i love his lyrics he's the frontman the only man of the mountain goats but at the same time i was also bracing myself for crap hopinghopinghoping that his jump to long form story telling wasn't an ill move it wasn't the story is told in reverse chronology with our main character sean having suffered a terrible accident a while back the story takes us and further and further back in time to the incident we know what happens though we don't really know why and there's massive tension as we brace ourselves for the inevitable it seems like i wouldn't be able to relate to sean given his actions his introversion and his love of role playing games but i defy you to not get utterly sucked into this sad and lonely but somehow not depressing story","1522":"interesting reading short book well written it gives food for thoughts","1523":"wow this is something else i don't know what to say about it it was very good but it's so unlike anything that i usually read beautifully written and haunting in tone it's not the most fun book i've read but i'm glad i read it because it's very good i don't expect to re read it but i look forward to talking about it with others or listen to people talk about it on podcasts","1524":"read in a little under three hours too overwhelmed to say anything more yet","1525":" this is the most intriguing book i've read this year i kept seeing it on best of lists last year but kept refusing to read it because let's face it this guy got a book deal because he's famous but i guess sometimes famous people can get book deals and end up writing really great books this is one it's a mystery of sorts but not the kind where you go around searching for clues more like there are these two foggy events that occurred an accident when sean was a teenager and another accident when sean is an adult involving teenagers who have been playing his text based mail order game he had developed the game while in the hospital recovering from the original accident of his youth the beginning of this book is like the mixed up shards of both accidents and slowly over time you start to piece it together this book is haunting lyrical and has an underlying theme about profound loneliness feeling disconnected and the moment we edge towards not feeling disconnected like the game there are an infinite number of directions one could head but the game is designed to not take you to the end the choices you make have consequences but ultimately are meaningless who is the wolf in the white van the devil or the catalyst that makes you do that meaningless thing with terrible consequences or is it sean view spoiler i like the complexity with which the shooting was handled it's ambiguous sort of planned sort of not sean doesn't seem deeply disturbed or depressed or more unhappy that the average teenager which is to say he's pretty unhappy but not unusually so and even though the shooting is somewhat premeditated you get the sense that that could have gone in one of many directions he might not have done it and gone on to lead a normal life but there is that seed of darkness maybe it would have gotten out later in some other way maybe not the wolf is described as restless but not running free hide spoiler if you like this book i would recommend all the birds singing by evie wyld","1526":"not really sure how i felt about this book the premise is interesting although super dark and not exactly a pleasure to read or put yourself into the mindset of the character and his world often felt like i had to push myself through continuing to read it to get to the end and whatever answers were offered about the central mystery","1527":"a luminous lovely novel with compelling characters and a deviously fascinating premise my only complaint would be that its conclusion doesn't quite satisfy not because of its lack of answers but because of its lack of cohesion with what precedes it i felt like i was reading a completely different novel for the last thirty pages or so still would definitely recommend this one to anyone interested in gray areas and dark corners","1528":"i couldn't put this down and then i was sad when i got to the end not because of the ending but because i wanted to keep hearing more from the main character i'm still sorting out the feelings this book left me with but i definitely recommend it","1529":"like a fever dream recorded on a cassette tape and played backwards wolf in white van is a smelted story of man whose life has been changed with only small glimpses of this change given at a time this is a book i'll be reading again","1530":"just splendid really still processing but splendid","1531":"this review has been

his disfiguring accident in the present day we hear about a lawsuit in which he is sued when two young people take his role playing game too seriously and one ends up dead and the other permanently disabled sean appears to be in a constant search for ways to relate to other people all his life he has been a huge fan of conan the barbarian and desires to express his rage like conan but without conan's moral code as an outcast because of his disfigured face sean mostly relates to people through his game the wolf in white van refers to a phrase that apparently plays when a particular christian rock record is played backwards sean hears of this when he is a child and learns this information on an evangelical tv program which fascinates him though no one seems to know what the phrase means they know it's evil attaching meaning to something they don't understand in sean's role playing game players mail him their moves and he mails them back possibilities based on their moves all choices have a specific outcome but with no real meaning as the story moves back through sean's history we learn what has happened to him before his accident sean would be perceived as a normal happy teen but in his world everything is a random move with little meaning life to him is a game and while playing it he made a really bad move i thought the story was a little slow going at the beginning and i didn't really know what was going on since it was told in reverse it would probably make a great re read but as i've only read it one time it gets three stars i want to like sean as he is the protagonist and narrator but it becomes more evident that he is a psychopath as a character he is chilling because he seems so normal from the outside i read this because it was recommended as a good adult book for teens i think it's a better book for adults and perhaps older teens who can stick with it and don't get too lost in the late 20th century references please ignore the following it's a booktalk for my teens and it doesn't fit in the private notes sigh if you see someone with a disfigured face your instinct may be to stare or to turn away regardless of your reaction you probably want to know what caused it at the beginning of the story we meet a man named sean phillips with a severely disfigured face for the most part he is cut off from the world he connects with players of a 1990's style role playing game that he has designed he has created scenarios and people mail him their moves and he mails them their next adventure as the story unfolds we learned what happened to sean before his injury sean would be perceived by most people as an average happy teen but in his world everything is a random series of actions with little meaning life to him is a game and while playing it he makes a really bad move more","1532":"i finished this book last week but have held off reviewing it because i was still pondering what i thought about it wolf in white van is about sean the creator of a successful role playing strategy game called trace italian the game is played through the mail he sends the players a scenario with various possible options and they'll send back their next move which is a pretty cool concept in and of itself but sean for reasons that become clear throughout the book has created this game out of necessity some huge accident occurred when he was younger and now he's horribly disfigured and rarely leaves his home trace italian provides him with income but it also serves as both a link to the outside world and an outlet for the fantasies that have consumed him since he was a child i had known john darnielle is a musician he performs as the band the mountain goats sometimes with others primarily as its only member and the guy is just a phenomenal lyricist just listen to the song the best ever death metal band out of denton and you'll see what i mean so it's not surprising that he's written a really smart gripping book what surprises me is how complex it is how the various pieces of the book emerge in fragments and layers and how so much remains open ended i'm still puzzling through all of these fragments and layers figuring out hints and symbols and figuring out exactly what i think about sean","1533":" the novel opens with distracted patchy descriptions that echo the disturbed thought patterns of the protagonist though initially hard to follow persistence brings the story into focus in pieces almost like a game in itself there is again that question of what is real that has come up in a lot of the books recently it is a close examination of someone's psyche and motivations time is all out of whack which means that you piece things together slowly and feel like you're getting into the mind of the narrator it becomes more and more gripping as you get dragged along the ending is a shock the meaninglessness and purposelessness of the protagonist's actions seem to reflect something more something that you cannot fully grasp slippery along the edge of your consciousness in its nihilistic horror a slow burn of a book that will stay with you","1534":"http wordnerdy blogspot com 2014 09","1535":" \"people trying to help you when you're past help are raw and helpless nobody wins you get nothing they feel worse \"what is this book about sean greatest invention is trace italian a play by mail role playing game that is more successful than you would imagine when two teenagers take the game too serious and die because of it sean is asked to defend himself and his work this causes him to reflect on a day in his own life where he made a self destructive decision that changed his entire future why is it boring a lot of this book is ruminations on sean's past which slowly will give you an understanding of why he did what he did besides the more psychological aspects of the novel there's also quite some time spend on the specifics of trace italian which i found fascinating but can be boring for people with a severe dislike to role playing games who would you recommend it to john darnielle is the singer and songwriter of the band the mountain goats so if you didn't know that and you do love their music definitely read this book and anyone interested in old skool role playing games and reading about peculiar main characters can not leave this book untouched why should i read it if it's boring darnielle is such a wordsmith i love his lyrics and although wolf in white van isn't nearly as poetic he crafts a narrative that captures you from start to finish he tells the story of sean in a roundabout way making sure that you will only find out what he actually did to himself by the end of the book this makes sense as it is a good and maybe somewhat easy way to keep the reader's interest but it never bothered me the story often eludes to what has happened and after a while i could make a pretty good guess so the mystery was never the important thing the journey towards his thoughts about that specific night again reliving what he did to himself is actually what the story is about sean is strange and a bit fucked up but at the same time he's an amazing person who created an entire fictional world for other people to play in people like himself outsiders or people who feel different from others it's a place for them to be safe and to be themselves what i liked about sean is that he didn't seem all that weird before his facial disfigurement people wouldn't stare at him in the street and his parents didn't worry all that much about him either but the fact that you seem normal doesn't necessarily mean that you are to me this book was about people who stand out either physically or psychologically and how they come to terms with themselves we all deal with dark thoughts and bad feelings but it doesn't matter what you feel but how you deal with them wolf in white van is a perfect study in portraying the long and lonely process of accepting who you are and the decisions you've made rating 4 5","1536":"i read this super slowly which was a blessing i think i could have raced through it and thought eh that was okay but because i borrowed it from a friend chris who spoke highly of it i took my time and sought out what was good about it which is a great way to live life the things that i liked best the narrator introduces himself and jumps in before telling us all about his face we can't see it so we are better able to hear his story without first writing our own about him which i think is something people do when they see someone who looks different as he goes along we learn more about what happened but he has the power over the reveal not us this spoke to my social work studies and the art of creating rapport darnielle did a great job of describing the way that the thoughts in our head are inadequately explained by our words and communication with others there are just some things that don't make sense when said out loud but are felt deeply this phenomena in itself is difficult to explain or describe but i felt that through the author's crafting of dialogue or lack of it i got it i love reading books where i never get the sense that i could have written that i could not write this but i'm glad someone did bonus points for a second plotline with a post apocalyptic theme sometimes i forgot that wasn't the point of the book and wondered what was going to happen next in the trace italian","1537":"beautifully written worth a read for the prose alone","1538":" wolf in white van is an interesting book to try to comment on i don't know if enjoyed is quite the right word i experienced this story and was captivated by it it takes you on a quite dark and unpleasant journey into the mind of its very broken main character whose oddities serve to highlight the pieces of his mind that everyone can sympathize with if you are looking for a quick read this took me about 10 hours cover to cover and are wiling to confront some of the really unpleasant places in the human psyche then i think wolf in white van is worth a read","1539":" you definitely shouldn't take my opinion as a non recommendation the book is definitely of a higher quality than the level of enjoyment i took from it the author made some big choices that just made the experience a little frustrating the story bounces between the narrator's remembrances of his childhood in the wake of an accident that left him disfigured and his narration of the present immediate past he has designed a play by mail text adventure game a cross between zork and choose your own adventure books in which he sends players a description of their situation in a post apocalyptic world and they mail in the moves they wish to take sounds like a perfect set up for me i love games i love at least the idea of zork even though i don't think i ever made it far i love inventive storytelling styles if this sounds good to you so far give the book a shot you might love it unfortunately for me the narrator is extremely slow in parceling out details about two central mysteries the nature of his childhood accident and how exactly it has disfigured him and the fates of a pair of teenagers who play his game in theory this sounds like it should be engrossing but i just thought the revelations came out too slowly and when they did emerge they were so vague as to lack in payoff but like i said i think it's well written creative and interesting so if it sounds appealing to you aside from my only three stars it's probably worth your time to try it out and see what you think","1540":" nope this book definitely didn't do it for me it was boring and depressing and was maybe supposed to be insightful or deep but it wasn't i don't understand all the positive reviews on here but also in nyt npr slate etc yea ok the storytelling was sort of creative except i don't even feel that it really worked it was more of a hook to make you keep reading so you could find out how it ends or rather began since it's told in reverse i didn't feel anything for the character nor did the writing allow me to get to know him maybe that was the point the most interesting characters to me were lance u0026amp carrie but their story wasn't told as i had hoped it might have been just dropped off i had the most empathy for his parents but again their stories were absent the fragmented nature of this just didn't do it for me creative or not it failed i didn't find it insightful or that creative just boring and dark except not dark enough to be intriguing to me more just as spectacle","1541":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here wolf in white van presents a sketch of a person i think more than it does anything else i like books that are essentially character studies and i like them especially when i relate strongly to the main character in these cases i think there's a lot more room to explore what people are really like i'm not sure how much you're really supposed to relate to sean i think maybe i related a little bit too much in places the story of the quiet awkward kid is easy for almost everyone to relate to wolf in white van presents a sketch of a person i think more than it does anything else i like books that are essentially character studies and i like them especially when i relate strongly to the main character in these cases i think there's a lot more room to explore what people are really like i'm not sure how much you're really supposed to relate to sean i think maybe i related a little bit too much in places the story of the quiet awkward kid is easy for almost everyone to relate to but sean has a certain streak of internal quiet anger sometimes his voice and thoughts seem oddly empty and sometimes strangely sharp for someone i think on the surface you're meant to feel sorry for because of his face and his pain and his life i love john's writing in his songs and i can hear pieces of songs in his writing here i can see why some people might find this book a little boring it can linger in places a little too long thoughts become strange and abstract but i find it easy to navigate because that's how my mind tends to wander anyway the ending was satisfying to me which is unusual i was prepared the ending to be disappointing or open ended in a way that made me wish there were more but at the end of the day i think the questions i wanted answered were answered more or less and my picture of sean was mostly complete more","1542":"i don't read much fiction but this was really good dark and disturbing but amazing characters and interesting writing","1543":"a powerful look at the outsider as adolescent and how decisions made at that time can change the course of a life forever wolf in white van is a lonely book darnielle nails what it is to be young and live in your imagination and how that can be a wonderful and yet damaging thing the story has hung with me for weeks after finishing it wonderful and dark i highly recommend it","1544":"i have a lot of feelings about this book the book itself is quite short so bear with me as my review may end up being as long as the novel so i first became aware of this book in august when i toured the macmillan warehouse there was a whole pallet of them waiting to be shipped out and as we walked past it the cover made me dizzy my editor our guide and i all stopped to stare at the cover and our guide said isn't this the worst cover you've ever seen i'm guessing it won't do well and they'll try and recover it for the paperback i asked what the book was about and why it had a cover like that and she said who even cares i laughed and promptly forgot all about it then a few months later i read an interview with rainbow rowell whose books fangirl and landline i just adore and she was talking about this book it's written by the lyricist of the mountain goats her favorite band and a man whose songwriting has been highly praised and i thought oh that might be good cover aside then it was listed for an alex award books for adults that would be good for teens too and i thought all right i'll read it rainbow rowell and the ala committee can't all be wrong and the cover is starting to grow on me in fact the cover is my favorite part of the book the cover once you read the book makes total sense it's about the only thing in this book that does darnielle's writing is lovely the book dances along almost as though it were a ballad the premise of it is fascinating i won't go into it and spoil anything but it's really unusual and the characters feel real sean the main character feels incredibly real which is why i wanted to walk up to him and demand that he tell me what was actually going on the book jumps back and forth in time to sean's childhood his teen years to the present which is 10 years 20 years after the incident that disfigured sean's face that's never clear there's also some events that are a year before more a couple of months i really don't know many of the chapters start out as a flashback that you don't realize is a flashback until you're halfway through i could put together only the roughest timeline for the book at all childhood teen years the incident stuff more stuff which is a problem because you can't see if sean is changing as a person you can't tell if he regrets the incident or some of the things that happen after he'll say one thing think another but there's no sense that he's lying either time he also doesn't think much about well anything bad things happen he moves on he clearly has a mental illness but that's not the point of the book what is the point of the book i don't really know is it a window into the life of someone who has an unspecified mental illness a look at how parents just don't understand a way of showing us that the creepy guy that lives down the block is really just weird and yeah kinda creepy but mostly harmless and that's why i have a problem with this book it started out so lovely so fascinating i wanted to know about the incident and the court case and just more about sean in general and then when i got some answers they turned out to be nothing i feel like i'm trapped in a version of the emperor's new clothes and i can't tell if i'm actually stupid or if i'm the child screaming the emperor is naked","1545":" sean suffered an injury view spoiler tried to commit suicide hide spoiler as a teenager and survived but lives as an adult with a very disfigured face while recovering from his injury he created a first person fantasy adventure game but instead of the game being a played as a video game or in a digital space sean runs the game by mail and mails players paper instructions for each next step of game the players read the information sean sends decide how they want to act write out their decisions and mail them back to sean sean then sends the player another set of instructions and options based on whatever decision the player made the mail sean sends and receives constitutes most of the social contact he has in sean's game called trace italian the players never win it would take more time than anyone has to make it to the end of the game but none of the players' decisions lead to death in the game either that would be bad for business since sean makes his living from his players' monthly game fees one player did graphically end his character's life in trace italian because as he explained to sean he thought his life was becoming too intertwined with the game and he wanted to live in the real world not the game and then two teenagers who were playing trace italian took it too literally and endangered themselves in the real world resulting in one teenager's death and the other's permanent disability having lived thorough his own life threatening event sean takes these endings both personally and philosophically but is never maudlin the themes of the book center around self destruction the thin edge between life and death and the contrast between fantasy and reality it sounds depressing as i type it but the tone of the book is very comfortable once sean's injury is behind him he doesn't mention any interest in hastening the end of his life and he doesn't seem at all depressed even though life after his injury is much more difficult than it was before finding the motive behind teenage sean's actions is the mystery of the story the book is nicely written and well paced the author jumps forwards and backwards in time to unveil the story in a non linear manner usually i don't appreciate that but mr darnielle did it very well i was disappointed when the story ended because i enjoyed sean so much","1546":"shockingly good this will suck you in and make you feel things you will not want it to end you may be disturbed this is a good thing","1547":"the second novel by john darnielle from the band the mountain goats was a good read shawn failed at his suicide attempt as a teenager and is horribly disfigured he finds escape by creating a role playing game which takes place via snail mail as shawn recounts his life he also tells the story of two players of his game who died when they confused the gone with reality great story well written worth checking out","1548":"i'll be thinking about this book for a long time","1549":" i am a mountain goats fan and have been for years because of that i know that john darnielle is an excellent storyteller and his writing is usually on the edge of the angst ridden cynical and biting his lyrics are evocative of suburban boredom and less than fulfilling relationships that are always on the edge of ending but don't this book has a similar feel to it and i can't completely wrap my head around it sean is an outcast because of an accident that leaves him severely disfigured he struggles to go out in public due to the staring and discomfort of those around him his parents are angry about the whole thing and he is left without any real friends most stopped coming around after not knowing how to deal with his injuries to keep himself busy while still having contact with the outside world he constructs an elaborate fantasy world where participants can pay to take turns within the game through the mail he becomes interested in the lives of several of his participants but is never really involved in their lives outside of the game unfortunately some people end up taking the game too seriously i don't really know what to think of this book as i just finished it last night and i'm still mulling it over in my mind sean is a deeply sympathetic character yet we don't get to know him that well his motivations aren't completely clear but as a narrator he is thoughtful and complex his story comes out in pieces i still feel his loneliness","1550":" john darnielle performs a remarkable feat of world building in this novel mapping out a young man's damaged psyche and his habitation of a lonely intersection between reality and fantasy not that the lines between those realms are so clear since mystery and monstrosity exist equally in both the world was a place full of ugly magic narrator sean writes about halfway through this novel whether this is meant as a lamentation or a celebration is just one of this book's many beautiful ambiguities a lovely harrowing read","1551":"while the book itself left me with a giant question mark the audio production of it was excellent","1552":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here meh this book is told from a first person pov and i wasn't able to form much of a connection with the protagonist the guy was so emotionally isolated and distant that no

of a connection with the protagonist the guy was so emotionally isolated and distant that no other characters for a reader to invest in ever presented themselves that really is the foundation of my 3 star rating other than disliking that characteristic of the novel it was a very well written story with some interesting layers the emotional distance isolation is one of the aspects that the story is set up to explore and my perception is that the protagonist sean was emotionally detached both before and after his disfiguring accident if you take the game he invented trace italian as a metaphor for his emotional life we are warned towards the start of the book that we are never going to breach the fortress at the heart of the game just like the players of trace italian we'll never discover if there is even anything inside the fortress or not no one is going to get that far darnielle is a graceful writer beautifully composed sentences good pacing to the plot i think the shifting timelines where sean brings up memories from the past into the present situation work well for this book there might be some interesting discussion about how reliable a narrator this protagonist is he claims not to get involved in the lives of the players of the game in invented claims that progress strictly follows a script yet sprinkled throughout we find all these exceptions to this claim and sean doesn't seem to realize he's made so many exceptions over the years good points for conversation and discussion to be found in this novel but in the end it all felt hollow more","1553":" i can't remember the last time i read such beautiful prose i wanted to live in the words forever my only complaint was that the book felt too short i liked that it was simple and clean and didn't say more than absolutely necessary but while i typically hate books that alternating narrators i was so drawn in by the characters of lance and carrie that i wanted more from them it's a testament to how well darnielle painted these portraits that i felt this way the narrative is wholly sean's and i get that but in this case i wanted to know more about what was going through lance's and carrie's heads if not alternating chapters then maybe a companion book that was released at the same time i think it would've made the story richer however the way everything unfolds is masterful as is i found the ending kind of anticlimactic though there had been so much build up and the relationship with kimmy could've been presented more clearly from the beginning grade a","1554":"my fourth 2015 alex award winner","1555":"this book had no point to me or i very much missed it i didn't care at all about anything that happened to the main character i quickly became uninterested in the ~mystery~ having guessed of how sean became disfigured the writing in this book tries way too hard it's incredibly melancholy and some of those unnecessarily long sentences yeesh it wasn't a good or interesting story but the structure of the novel was kind of interesting though a bit confusing at times","1556":"this book is incredibly hard to describe but it was very intriguing the main character lives very much in his own head and i think his thoughts capture a lot of the philosophizing people do about our purpose and the whole why are we here question it's hard to say more than that but it was incredibly thought provoking i read this for a book club and i'm happy that was the choice because i don't think i would have ever picked up this book on my own but i'm glad i read it","1557":"i really enjoyed reading this book i thought it was unique and it kept me thinking throughout the whole thing but i read this book in bits and pieces and i forgot most of this book by the time i picked it up again i was fuzzy on the details sometimes when reading it because of the pace in which i read it but i did loved it i will definitely read this book again sometime","1558":"i read this shortly after reading the making of prince of persia by jordan mechner startling similarities and startling differences","1559":"pretty spectacular one of the best books i've read in a very long time","1560":"without a doubt the best book i've read all year","1561":"i don't know what i'm missing here was there a plot i think i will come back to this review after the book sinks in a few hours","1562":" what an enthralling read i haven't felt this engaged with the mind of a young man in a novel since holden caufield and for all sean's obvious outward disturbance he's deeply interesting and at the heart kind the telling of the story weaving in and out of a few different points of sean's story yet all unmistakeable his voice was surprisingly easy to follow a testament to darnielle's mastery of the craft the thing that lets me know it was so good is that i immediately wish i could find out more particularly about the other characters i'd love to hear more from teague and kimmy and chris and more backstory on lance and carrie but alas this is sean's story i'll probably never fully understand it but it moves me to deep compassion particularly for the outcast and the misunderstood and perhaps the best antidote for the misunderstood is not to understand but to look them in the eye i think sean would respect that","1563":" 4 5 starsdo you remember the pain and uncertainty and beauty of adolescence the intensity of your feelings and dreams john darnielle already known to many as the creative force behind the indie band the mountain goats does the main character of this novel sean phillips navigates his adolescence by losing himself in fantasy and role playing the consequences of this are unexpected and devastating his story unfolds in reverse and demands careful reading but the rewards are worth it a stunning debut","1564":"i dislike hardcover books i was going to write 'hate' or 'despise' because that is the front i put on it's like part of my thing my performance of who i am that i hate hardcover books but i don't think i dislike them as much as i claim but i do think something about a new hardcover book essentially clashes with my conception of books as a comfort and guide and challenge to life my ideal book is a paperback that fits in a purse but i cast this aside for john darnielle because he deserved it and it felt right and i bought it at an independent bookstore so at least there was that if all had gone as originally planned i would have bought it in hardcover anyway actually since john darnielle's book tour came to chicago a week after i started college i'd even met a fellow mountain goats fan willing to accompany me but it was a week after i started college and there were things to do that tuesday and i'd just seen the mountain goats in concert that june and it felt almost wrong or maybe selfish to see john darnielle twice in one year when he'd already closed his set at the mayan with california song wolf in white van is a mountain goats song in novel form which strangely enough was somewhat unexpected well that's not quite right i guess your typical mountain goats song protagonist is often in some sort of romantic entanglement which sean of wolf in white van is not the sort of mountain goats song wolf in white van is closest to is the best ever death metal band out of denton of course with a dash of something from we shall all be healed and the sunset tree and also transcendental youth like cry for judas i'm not sure where i'm going with this aside from that in some ways john darnielle's lyrics writing is often sharper than his novel writing which was also unexpected the novel is less dependent on sharp zingers i guess because it doesn't have a limited couple minutes to prove its worth in any case the aftertaste is the same which is that despite the consistent bleakness of a mountain goats song or no because of that insistent bleakness that honesty i'm amending to honesty because in a lot of ways bleakness severely underrates reduces both the content and style of john darnielle's work there is nothing warmer 'heartwarming' might be pushing it nothing that makes you feel more kind and hopeful and tender towards humans wolf in white van is the perfection of this effect and does it better than a mountain goats song ever has maybe better than any other literature i've read its rival in this matter is the work of george saunders especially 'tenth of december' what i'm saying is i already feel like i should reread wolf in white van and more carefully or give it to someone also i forgot to mention this that john darnielle is one of those people who's never forgotten what it's like to be a child or a teenager but in a non creepy way i think he knows what it's like to be youthful more and better than i ever have and it's better because he also knows what it's like to be an adult and to be in the weird interstice between teenager and adult","1565":"we always look for simple concrete answers to the tough questions in life but often it's much more complex even to the person best positioned to give an answer i think the book did an excellent job capitalizing on that tension it may be frustrating to some in our world of boiled down sound bites but very refreshing to me personally","1566":"i don't believe i can write a review of this book that will do it justice plus other reviewers have already said many of the things i'd want to say anyway right now i just want to marinate in my own thoughts books that make me feel this way afterward are the reason i read","1567":"i liked this book but still finished it wondering why the writing and storyline were original","1568":"more like 3 5 stars i just couldn't honestly give it 4 because although i liked it it left me wanting too much more","1569":"to say this is a book about a teenage boy who tries and fails to kill himself is only scratching at the surface a little weird a little dark a little difficult to keep up with the jumps back and forth in time but stick with it worth it","1570":"despite the novel's slim storyline and the introverted nature of the main character's life this book was incredibly haunting and mesmerising i enjoyed how the writer created equal parts sympathy and revulsion in the main character and how the mundane could become extraordinary","1571":"the cover caught my eye first then the story captured my attention this well written long list fiction contender for the 2014 national book award details the inner workings of a social misfit's world there is not much action as the events have already happened there is still plenty of suspense when you wondered what happened and when it will be revealed the story mirrors the game in the story","1572":"this book fell into my hands somehow and intrigued me by the jacket blurb though the cover made my eyes spin two threads of the same story told from opposite directions excellent writing intricate story lines compelling character detail enough so that by the end which is the beginning of the story i really did not like the central character but i suppose the author knew that would be a reaction it then made me wonder about the quality of forgiveness how much can one forgive about another's past to be actually able to like trust believe or even love them in the present","1573":"i am new to reading fiction and i think choosing this book for me was a mistake i just found it hard to read but did not know why i heard people call this type of book experimental fiction this may have been the problem for me because the book just seemed to drag on in all different directions for no apparent reason","1574":"i listened to this on audio which was read by the author beautifully written book and compelling story as well darnielle's reading voice added so much to the story john darnielle can write and read out loud looking forward to his next offering","1575":"i really loved this novel darnielle's writing is reminiscent of our own thoughts you find yourself inside the mind of sean desperately wishing that he would explain what happened","1576":"this book made me mad it wasn't that long and i was determined to finish the story but i did not enjoy it there's a lot of time shifting between the present and the past of the narrator main character's life and a virtual game world which is fine but it jumped around sporadically all leading up to the explanation of an accident and climax of the story you never find out who the wolf in the white van is therefore you must infer that tidbit of course this makes sense since the main character maintains a mail in game where players choose their own moves the writing is very good it just didn't leave me with a good feeling whatever i'm so glad it's over","1577":"i wanted to start again immediately upon finishing this i'm sure it will take me a long time to process certainly it left me emotionally unsettled but the piercing and honest quality of the writing lifted it far far above mere shock value to something probingly sincerely seeking to understand and explain the deepest least knowable landscapes of the human imagination and the tenuous relationship being reality and the inner sanctum our mind constructs to shield us from it","1578":"wolf in the white van i a hard book to put into a category its not fiction but is mixed with fiction its about everyday but its hardly an everyday book its about a person after an accident with a disability but that is not what the book is about not a bout mystery or a thriller as the story its what it is a circular story that takes us through the life of an autor and developer of a by mail roleplaying game whose face was destroyes in what we are told was an accident suicide attempt there are turns there are twist there are people of his youth who reaper those who died players who come and go and those who died there s some drama around but the story is ultimately about the main character's feeling and throughs behind all these events not the events they are just a platform to tell the story the story is well told but can be easily put aside sometimes its hard to follow not because its confusing but because the story doesn't compel you to go on with a mystery with a discovery with a destiny all is about the true beginning of the character in the end pd i am not entirely sure if its a mistake or if the character or even the author didn't understood conan at all he only mentioned the messy darker parts but conan was mostly about the honorable savagery against the ruined civilization more importantly and here is where my question about the true mistake lies he mentions that conan roams cimmeria which there is no greater lie conan is the cimmerian as he comes from there and there is mention of his land but little else conan meanwhile roams hyboria","1579":"a lot of filler and it didn't really come together all that cohesively but the story itself was very unique and the writing was pretty solid","1580":"this book has several very interesting threads in it the interactive fiction by mail the two players the conan stuff the effects of disfigurement but i am just not sure it all comes together for me into a whole sock or whatever one makes with threads and i hate to say it but there were just a few moments when it felt a bit too much like the author was attempting to write literature instead of letting the story tell itself maybe this is a result of his being a musician and lyricist but sometimes certain turns of phrase felt shoe horned to distracting effect i had trouble with the rhythm of the novel as well the passages from the trace italian could have formed a refrain instead they felt like disjointed slices that never really unfurled in a coherent enough way to add to the telling i enjoyed many moments within the book but overall it drew me in just to spat me back out or leave me feeling like i was never drawn in to begin with view spoiler i wonder if this novel would be as notable if it weren't deliberately told in a backwards forwards manner in that it reminded me of christopher nolan's following there's nothing that the inverted narrative structure does to emphasize the themes of the novel is there why are the details of the attempted suicide kept from us except to maintain intrigue am i strange to feel deceived by this not to mention the lack of resolution to either the two kids who died in the desert or chris who quit the game hide spoiler","1581":"when i finished wolf in white van my first thought was jesus god i was driving mr f on his nightly ride the ride usually takes 28 minutes but as we neared the end of it he wasn't really sleepy so i took us around a different subdivision one where on a high curve you can look to your left and see houses the size of resort chalets giant monstrous cavernous things that tower above the road and have more windows than anyone could need they're always dark these houses you never see anyone in them not going in not coming out not moving around inside in one there is sometimes a dim glow of the kind of small lamp certain people leave on at night a 40 wtt bulb that bleakly illuminates framed prints and a set of leather couches the houses seem too big so large that they must be inhabited by people larger than those we see on the streets on the right off this curve is a long dark expanse of forest sloping away to the nature trails where the boys and i walk and beyond that a few houses visible before the vast gulf of lake mendota off in the distance in this direction far away and tiny is the state capitol whose dome can just barely be made out glowing white and granite there's almost nobody ever out on the roads when we do these drives we go by car dealerships and through an industrial park where i can see call center jobs' cubicles through windows of rectangular buildings past the tall glass building where i want to have my office someday through sleepy suburb streets and past a church st bernard's where as you sit by the red light next to roman candle pizzeria which burnt the crust the only time we ever ordered a pizza from them you can see a light from inside the church glowing through the stained glass window and creating a halo around the portrait of st bernard's head it's that kind of atmosphere that i was in as i listened to wolf in white van the past few days wolf in white van is a book made for quiet solitude for long silences and soft darkness but after that you will want to turn on all the lights eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich listen to children play something to wipe away the jesus god of the story wolf in white van is narrated by and is about sean and revolves around two significant events in his life his accident which has left his face in such a state as to draw confused stares from children and to make sean compare himself eating candy while watching the people's court to an octopus feeding and second how a game he created a mail order game in which people write in their turns trying to figure out a role playing type adventure set in an apocalyptic future had inadvertently caused the death of a young girl when she and her boyfriend got carried away and tried to act the game out in real life over and across and back and through those two things sean slowly unfolds his story as an unpopular near loner in school whose head was filled with stories of conan the barbarian and terrible images beyond even what he reads in his books all the way to a future where he sits in his house supported by insurance money and revenues from his mail order game visited once a week by a nurse he calls victory it is as sad and lonely a book as i've ever read and sean's story makes no real distinction in his telling it between what really happened to him and what he imagines his players doing in the game as they send in their moves the imaginary world of the game is he knows not real but it was this world that got him through his accident that's how he always refers to it and it's revelatory when he describes the accident and the aftermath of it creating this world in his mind planning the game carried him through long days staring at the ceiling of the hospital the last half chapter of the book though is truly apocalyptic and i use that in the most literal sense of the word an event that changes one's understanding of the world surrounding us either through changing the world or changing us or both sean details the day leading up to the accident the slow hypnotic crawl of the day that ended up being a pivotal moment in his life there's no sense that sean hates his life after the accident nor that he hated it before it he describes southern california just before the accident as beautiful scorning the people who scorn it afterwards he describes his life in similar terms as the book jumps back and forth wolf in white van is short on explanations and long on details the way life is even though much of the book is sean's internal imagination it feels more real than similar books about similar people or subjects in its sheer inscrutable nature wolf in white castle perfectly conveys how it must feel to be sean before and after and during these events it is a chilling sad sober book that made me feel bereft at the end the kind of book where my body didn't quite know how to react wolf in white castle creates an emotion that is hard to explain call it incongruous sorrow a feeling created by a series of events that should not have created that feeling it's an emotion i suspect all of us have felt at some point a low point in our lives that should not exist based on everything that has happened and yet there it is the ending of the book made me understand for just a brief moment that other people have felt such moments that they exist for everyone and that making it past moments like that is part of living the ending made me feel like i should be crying but i couldn't because it didn't make sense to cry it made me feel like i needed people around me at the same time i wanted to be alone it made me as i drove along that high ridge and looked at first the dark houses then the faraway capitol building then my son starting to doze in the seat next to me think jesus god and then be glad that i was only listening to such a moment rather than living it myself","1582":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was a very entertaining read i finished it in one day over a couple of sittings after finishing up the last dark scene i took several minutes trying to decide whether i liked this book or not i really enjoyed the trace italian portions of the book and although confusing at times i really enjoyed how the book was written in a backwards ish way it was very interesting to see how the main character regressed from being somewhat positive about life after his accident and what the futur this book was a very entertaining read i finished it in one day over a couple of sittings after finishing up the last dark scene i took several minutes trying to decide whether i liked this book or not i really enjoyed the trace italian portions of the book and although confusing at times i really enjoyed how the book was written in a backwards ish way it was very interesting to see how the main character regressed from being somewhat positive about life after his accident and what the future held to the earlier days when he was negative depressed and obviously suffering from psychological issues i cannot think of what i specifically didn't like about this book but i feel like it needed something more maybe more background on the main character's mental health either way a great read glad i picked it up more","1583":"a sensitive portrait of a young male loner and it resonated as someone who spent much of the last six months and few years dealing with physical rehab and the isolation of medical conditions","1584":"felt a bit contrived could be a poorman's chuck palanuik novel still enjoyed reading it","1585":" i think i would give this 4 5 stars but it deserves rounding up i don't know why i'm so surprised that darnielle's prose much like his music holds so much power for me what i loved most were the small insights into human interactions especially the way sean talks with his parents the way he processes how he feels after saying something cruel to his mother or the way he carefully holds himself back from manifesting the fear onlookers experience when they look at his face i loved the scenes with his home nurse vicky for this reason as well and the scene with the two young men in the parking lot i sometimes find that books trying to travel in multiple directions in time accomplish neither well but the opposite is true in this case the two plots are like birds circling over the same carcass slowly and you know when they land it will be ugly but you follow them anyway because you need to see it come together the uncertainty about why sean did what he did doesn't weigh on me as much as i thought it would i got lost in this book lost in trace lost in sean's head and heart his past and present the only reason this would lose 5 of a star would be that a few of the passages in the beginning about music books sean read as a kid blurred together and droned slightly too loud pulling me out of the story's general hypnotic lull i can't even pick a favorite quote there are too many good words buzzing in this book","1586":"3 5 5trigger warning for depression and suicide i really enjoyed this book i think it treats depression and suicide well and doesn't romanticize it it kind of just goes with the flow of it i liked the idea of sean creating this mail based game and it not only helping him live with his mistakes but helping others i think with the two players taking things to far that it caused him to remember when he took things to far","1587":"wolf in white van is john darnielle's first novel and those who know his music will certainly notice recurring themes and motifs in the book that crop up repeatedly in his lyrics misunderstood teenagers drifting through comic shops and amusement arcades in soulless rundown american towns depression awkward family relationships and a tendency to retreat into a world of fantasy are all elements of wolf in white van that mountain goats fans will recognise and as usual darnielle writes about them with remarkable poignancy and clarity don't however imagine that you need to know darnielle's music to enjoy this book it's an exceptional piece of work by any standards wolf in white van is an introspective reflective novel narrated by sean a young man whose face has been partially destroyed by an 'accident' at the age of 17 sean makes his living through what is essentially a role playing game by correspondence that he devised during his recovery called trace italian and set in a post apocalyptic america it's played by the readers of comic books and science fiction magazines who pay a subscription fee and receive each step in the game by post mailing their choices for the next move back to sean in attempt to reach the game's ultimate goal a secretly located safe haven for survivors as the story gradually unfolds we learn not only of an alienated teenage couple whose intense obsession with trace italian and with each other has resulted in tragedy but also of the days leading up to the horrific event that left sean disabled and severely disfigured there is a great deal of beauty in wolf in white van darnielle's prose is outstanding and there are whole passages that read to me like an extended prose poem his ability to pick out mundane details and turn them into something of an incredibly evocative sometimes tragic significance is nothing short of remarkable there is also such a desperate vividly realised sadness to parts this book that at times i found it almost painful to read and rightly so this is no criticism on my part a short but digressive novel wolf in white van doesn't really leave its protagonist in any different state mentally or physically than the one in which he starts his story and at the end i was left wanting something more afterwards to bring the story to a neater finish however this by no means a plot driven novel and it can't be denied that the ending is a powerful one however uncomfortable it was for me to read i can admire darnielle's decision to leave the story there rather than pandering to any desire for a more reassuring conclusion","1588":"this book is so wildly successful i'm at a loss to describe how or why the sheer sense of play to the novel is so exciting you can help but follow it down the darkest corners imaginable","1589":"first book of 2015 and boy did it suck i went into this book with high hopes i read the book jacket the rave reviews and i was ready or at least i thought i was i honestly can't say anything bad about the book itself it wasn't the author's style or his writing i think what finally led me to stop on page 55 and call it quits was the subject matter itself this book just didn't appeal to me at all i found the narrator to be cold detached and not very compelling at all and the detailed descriptions of things like ceiling tiles and other minutiae had me fighting sleep every five minutes not my cup of tea","1590":"it broke my heart a lot","1591":"this book feels ominous even without anything really happening i could have read a whole story just about the trace italian game","1592":"such a strange and wonderful novel","1593":"i was going to be lonely anyway this isn't a book so much as a gut punch which is to say i loved it","1594":"a strange slow book reading it was sometimes haunting and evocative and alternately frustrating and confusing darnielle one of my favorite musicians and songwriters puts out an odd debut novel about a man with a terrible self inflicted disfigurement who operates a sort of mail order role playing game as the book skips about in time we understand his loneliness during both adolescence and adulthood this is someone with few close relationships who is deeply aware of how his family former friends and strangers are unsettled by him in some ways the reading experience reminded me of jamaica kincaid's see now then the book moves backward not forward darnielle is far more concerned with evoking a mood than telling a story to that end he is successful i felt the pain the loneliness the awkwardness the game within the book was a cool narrative device the premise is interesting still i wish darnielle had done more than just create a mood he has three minute songs that contain stronger plots and more complex minor characters i expected more","1595":"john darnielle is my favourite lyricist he is an amazing song writer and it is no surprise that this is a masterful work of lyricism and restraint i have never read a book like this before that's a rare thing brilliant and difficult as anything worthwhile should be","1596":"this was a great read for me i enjoyed the story and there are some beautifully written parts i will definitely re read this in the near future","1597":"john darnielle has created a perfect object it may not be for everyone but wolf in white van struck such a chord with me it took my usual needs of any book interesting plot strong characters writing style and went deep across all three personal resonance on some of the story a real and complex protagonist and an unparalleled writing style to the last point i usually spend most of my time reading at somewhat of a surface level like mild add but darnielle's style demands careful focus at the word by word level and at the macro level of writing a story in reverse order and it just clicked for me the palatable 200 page size helped significantly in this regard though i did not want it to end if the plot sounds at all interesting and know that it really does not require a strong interest in gaming though it did help hook a nerd like me and you get through the first couple of pages i can't recommend wolf in white van strongly enough and i look forward to darnielle's next","1598":"a slim but gripping tale of a game designer coping with the the death of a teenage follower the structure of the novel which is told in reverse is very effective and the final chapter leads the reader back to a powerful defining moment a really lovely dark and deep book for the right reader","1599":"i read this book in one day and i immediately wanted to start it over when i finished it wolf in white van is supposedly a phrase heard when playing a particular record backwards this story is told ending to beginning as well and quite effectively perhaps the devil is indeed lurking within its pages i'm recommending this book around town these days","1600":"it was aiight","1601":"i really wish you could give half stars to books like this one i reserve a 5 for books that will stick with me forever and i'll recommend to anyone this book will definitely stick with me but it's also not for everyone such an interesting way of writing and i'm still wanting more","1602":"disturbing haunting ultimately unsatisfying and yet there was something special about it i was drawn in gradually started to understand even though i didn't really understand an unusual book","1603":"i feel about it the same way i do about a highly regarded albums on pitchfork i don't think i'm quite smart or depressed enough to fully get it as one reviewer puts it \"it explores isolation creativity and the permeable membrane between outer and inner worlds how childhood dreams and teenage obsessions colour the infinite expanses of the mind and how far we can share our interior journeys \" i'll be over here listening to taylor swift i guess","1604":"so sad and pretty such a bizarre and fascinating premise to explore with great vividness","1605":"certainly original and a nifty existential commentary","1606":" there is a line in in the fault in our stars by john green that says sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book and then there are books like an imperial affliction which you can't tell people about books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like betrayal somehow i feel that quote is all needed to explain how i feel about this book i was afraid that my judgement of this book would be too clouded by my conviction that john darnielle's band the mountain goats are the best band in the universe and that jd is the best contemporary lyricist whose songs i can relate to at an almost spiritual level but i tried to look at it in a neutral light it's a hard book to describe without spoiling it the cover sort of gives it away but instead of being linear the story is built like a labyrinth in a way that resembles the game that the main character creates hidden gems of thought in the dark alleyways of the story when i finished it i sat for a while just trying to come to terms with the strange feeling the end left me i just couldn't understand why the main character sean did what he did in the end which is actually the beginning chronologically speaking what triggered it the answer i found after re reading some passages is that there is no reason maybe we are not meant to find the reason because that is how life plays out in the end things happen that you can not control and this must especially be hard for sean who seems to be fighting the inner battle of looking at the road and deciding which of the thousands of paths to take so maybe what he did was his way of taking control of his life of choosing one of the paths before finding that he had blindly followed through one i can t help but feel that there is a deeper meaning to dive for in the story or maybe just like its title referencing the supposed satanic messages in rock music when you play songs backwards we should read the story backwards and find a hidden message or maybe as the christian fanatics in the 80's realized there is no hidden message only the meaning that we give what we find","1607":"never listened to john's band didn't have prior feelings about him just getting that out of the way so you know i'm not trying to play the book up very interesting book and it felt very personal also much against the protagonist i can truly relate and see myself in sean protag and maybe in john himself some of the feelings of solace in being alone in your own world in being left alone for the most part are plucked right out of my brain i've also ran in circles of anonymous text based rpg internet fourms star wars fantasy dnd gundam in my teenage years and i can tell you john hits the hammer on the head with his portrayal of players i haven't ever looked at reviews but i'm sure there are people that probably complain about this but this really how it usually is you don't ever get much info about these people at the most you get snippets and snapshots of them and their lives you might connect with one or two seriously and really become friends but for the majority you string together bits and pieces based off their actions and the snippets of their lives the usual suspects are all here as well the people who are almost comically very brief and to the point the people who play this same game pretty casually forever and you wonder what keeps them going and of course the people who live the game and make it essential to their very existence i also love the part where sean might happen upon one of the players in the real world and just tries to be invisible to the player if i was sean i'd do the same exact thing the book is a puzzle in itself you are given pretty much the modern day from the start of the novel and it works backwards slowly dropping bits of key info as the story unfolds this is definitely a book that warrants a re read to complete the fullness of the puzzle for yourself the game sean runs is kind of puzzle like sean's injuries although hard to fully grasp seemed also maybe puzzle like in the scarring the dust jacket looks like a puzzle puzzles puzzles puzzles the book also brings in situations that maybe everyone can relate to being different wanting to feel attention but also wanting to be left alone solitude both mentally and physically thinking back to simpler or better days gone by feeling unloved unwanted or thrown away by people the transient ness of people and people you felt like you had a bond to some other themes i'll leave off so not to spoil my gripes to the book are pretty minor because of the way of the narrative you don't really know who to really pay attention to i would confuse chris for lance lance for chris chris for other players jj for teague at one point it wasn't real bad you get everything straight at some point then again maybe that was part of the puzzle there were also parts where john writes smooth as butter but then it gets confusing by injecting random thoughts or feels sean has or just changing the subject quite quick once again only minor could add to the puzzle that's the way you'd think remember etc bits and pieces really all things he could tighten up if he writes another book and i hope he does if this is a bit messy i literally just finished the book i thought maybe i'd mull over the book and i will but then i thought it more important i give to you fresh and what i took away having just finished if you can relate to the themes i listed above i'd strongly recommend this book to you if not it might be lost on you even then take a walk in someone else's shoes","1608":" i still can't help but feel i was supposed to learn more from this than i did like i'm missing important connections or not catching on to some important truths it's quite a gripping story in its own meandering way i think you know what's going on but there's such a reluctance to admit it and at the same time a suspensefulness that maybe there is some huge twist or unexpected thing that will happen it's somewhat straightforward in the end but just so fascinating at the same time i am in awe of the way the character's imagination was expressed by the author maybe i'm jealous saying the book was enjoyable doesn't quite capture it it was singular or momentous on a scale of the day to day i liked it loma linda is mentioned that was a jolting surprise","1609":"just shy of unmitigated masterpiece i absolutely loved this book poetic and alien and sad and strange and wholly original and compelling a real odball of a book but in a very good way good freaking job darnielle keep it up","1610":"too weird for me to enjoy after a disfiguring injury sean lives isolated and makes up a role play game called trace italian through the game the lines of reality and fantasy are blurred with tragic results","1611":"this was a difficult book to wrap my head around i am not sure i really get it now that i am finished the ending left me feeling sad because all throughout the book i really liked sean i felt sorry for him because something happened to him that screwed up his life forever we knew sort of knew what it was but the final chapter revealed a darkness that i didn't want to find","1612":"the valleys isolation cleaves depression in the geological rather than biological definition populate the lonely expanse of john darnielle's novel having been a fan of his personal and complex lyrical creations i was excited to hear he wrote a novel his ability to adjust the scope of the claustrophobic embarrassment of the most mundane thoughts to the exotic pull of infinite musing is absolutely perfect the clarity and sensitivity of awakening in a hospital bed is deftly handled","1613":"i really wanted to like this book but i just don't get it i kept waiting for this great finale and then it ended i feel like i completely missed the point","1614":"interesting and visual writing style not so scary or","1615":" good i enjoyed reading it but i don't really like the protagonist in reading it i told others that there seemed to be two strands to the book the mundane life of our hero and his introspective nigh omniscient perspective of things the former i disliked and the latter i enjoyed i think ultimately the trace italian could have saved me but it didn't it doesn't really save anyone though so perhaps that's the truth beyond all truths i'm sorry to my friends who love john darnielle i don't deserve your love anymore","1616":"beautiful writing the story is told backward but there isn't really a lot of suspense as to what the accident was it's fairly obvious from very close to the beginning a very quick read but unfortunately i don't have a lot of sympathy with the protagonist his problems seem too minor for the drastic action he takes took the game playing is also a bit hard to swallow i'm not sure kids now would really opt to play through snail mail when there are so many virtual worlds ready to enter on line however these are merely quibbles i was hoping for something more like ready player one i just picked this up at the library and the writing did grab me at once it's just the story i find a bit hard to accept","1617":"honetly i'm not really sure what to think it's a quick read it's well written in the sense as a look into the mind of this particular boy man the tone and language is consistent and makes you feel like the voice of this character is real the book itself is an interesting journey through one person's mind imagination and memory that weaves through his lifetime jumping from time to time in a somewhat puzzle like manner but never in a confusing manner the reader can always tell the time frame within a sentence or two of the jump it's also an interesting look into the subculture of role playing games but that doesn't seem to be the overarching point so much as diving into the mind of this interesting and unique character i read it cause i'm a fan of the mountain goats but it's worth a quick read and i read it more quickly than many books i've read in the past few years","1618":"i'm sorry other friends who seem to have liked this book i just i don't even understand what just happened i like books with plots maybe i'm not smart enough to understand what it was about i thought it was a book about a fantasy game","1619":"love the writing the story falls flat but that ending strikes a serious chord even though you know its coming the inevitable act is displayed so innocently","1620":"well this was a well written book despite having a lot of excellent reviews i just couldn't get into it is it a book about isolation and the socially awkward is it a book about mental health is it a book about bad people and good people i'm not sure if the life of sean and the world of trace italian were supposed to intertwine but they didn't really great the guy is really deep into his fantasy world with a strange name he was shot in the face but i don't get what i'm supposed to do with this information sean is a pretty disconnected person and it was pretty hard to like him because he didn't feel real to me or maybe just his lack of feeling for anything made it hard to like him or get to know him i connected with a few parts of this book there were undertones of the strange and dark thought processes that go hand in hand with some mental health issues but then it never went anywhere as such i didn't see the point of a lot of the characters or plot elements was there a plot the repetition of the flashbacks became grating and i wasn't shocked or horrified by the content maybe i'm as dead inside as sean seemed to me but there was very little for me here i would however consider checking out something else by this author because the writing was good i just didn't click with the material","1621":" darnielle is such an immediately engaging writer and a testament to that is the fact that i've got so much mountain goats stuff in my head and didn't feel like this read like a novel by the mountain goats guy the narrative voice was really confident and strong and i loved the world of the game which was rendered in a loving way that makes it clear why this fairly arcane game would appeal to the people who play it definitely dark though and ultimately i felt like it didn't go in the direction i'd hoped getting more abstract and internal when i was looking to see the pieces of the story fit together without giving too much away i guess that was sort of the point though and it sort of frustrates you in the same way that it describes the characters' frustration at trying to understand one another's motivations interesting way to structure it and surely some things i missed but for me it made some of those latter parts feel a little more distant","1622":"a story told with a slow reveal of the many facets of the main character and his world it builds to a great and surprising end","1623":"maybe 3 5 i dunno i enjoyed it definitely but i'm not sure what it was saying i don't know how much i really got out of it i dunno","1624":"layered and dense and deliberately obtuse and that's the point there's a lot of thought packed into 200 pages and some incredibly lyrical writing not easy and

worth it","1630":"never read a book like this and never will read a book like this again the lead singer from the mountain goats surprised me with his incredible intricate storytelling skills in a

think about this one","1632":"this book feels a little like a zen koan slight hints of images and events that indirectly suggest a wider vaster whole the narrator's voice is haunting slightly creepy yet so enigmatic and tender i found it utterly compelling there's white space and dark matter here something about the nature of choice and consequence the fragmentation of memory and so many weighted moments that are like life either deeply meaningful or totally banal and pointless i kind of can't stop thinking about it i couldn't help wishing for a few more solid movements to hint at what the

from the real world the second tragedy involves two teen players of trace italian taking the game too far into reality leading to the death of one of the players the ironic bookends of these two events might seem too programmatic if not for darnielle's deft handling of nonlinear storytelling sean's narration is structured around free associative flashbacks to before and after each tragedy as well as meditations on trace italian including snippets of gameplay--sean's game instructions and the moves of various players the plot as such is fairly scanty but the protagonist's meditations on the events in his life vibrate with intensity and inner depth and though sean is an adult in the story's present day darnielle's psychologically complex portrayal of sean's childhood and adolescence

most moving novels i've read in a long time beautiful","1638":"it took some time to get into the writing style of this book which is why i took a star off but overall i really liked how the writing style went because it let the ending be what it was if that makes any sense","1639":"that prose","1640":"beautiful and sad in every way john darnielle's ability to tell a story that's raw and fierce

himself in the face that's such a final and decisive move and it just didn't feel correctly aligned with the character to have no real reason or explanation for shooting one's self seems incredibly unbelievable maybe there is more beneath the surface but after discussion and speculation i just don't see it more","1642":"jd this is incredible but also how could you","1643":"what an enigmatic story this book is a tough nut to crack but well worth sticking with it very little happens in the present of this novel but a lot unfolds within the mind of the disturbed narrator sean and a horrible incident that defines him he circles and circles around it until the end in the meantime the book becomes a meditation on memory how it shapes changes defines and tortures us it is about the past how in hindsight we see infinite alternatives for touchstone choices much like the role playing game sean runs but we can never go back but the book is also about the power both saving and destroying of storytelling this book was a labyrinth but i didn't mind getting lost in it at all","1644":" wolf in white van is a thought provoking experience rather than writing reflections on this book to no one in particular i'll try to stick to a more logistical review of its content the story is told in the narrative voice of sean phillips a young man whose face was disfigured following an accident in his teenage years who then created a successful play by mail role playing game that led to a tragic event involving two of its teenaged players the narrative itself goes back and forth in time tracing the events from the fallout of his accident to the actual event as well as the tragedy involving the two players back to when he created the game itself i think this approach was rewarding in the end but it took me at least half the book to get used to it additionally sean's narration gave the story a purposefully i think uneasy edge sean's disfigurement is isolating an effect that shows in his story telling obviously because sean is telling the story little outside of his perspective is perceived by the reader however this effect is added to by the isolation of sean's character from the outside world he is jaded and hyper aware led to conclusions about people and events that seem certain to himself but questionable to the reader as the story progresses by which i mean goes back in time to his adolescence it becomes clear that these qualities have always been present in sean leading the reader or at least me to the conclusion that sean is likely mentally ill however the book also includes many elements of imagination the game sean created whose contents are occasionally inserted throughout the book relies heavily upon imagination and whose players and creator often blur the line between reality and non reality i think it's possible that darnielle was also exploring the daily role of imagination in human life how often and easily one can slip from this world to another the style of wolf in white van and its narrator leave little room for character development outside of sean due particularly to his inability to judge anyone based on anything other than their perception of him however themes of tragedy and death adolescence and imagination love and hate are explored in this story that i think has much more to offer than i've likely perceived darnielle's prose is as intriguing and beautiful as his lyrics and i will likely read anything else he hopefully publishes","1645":"well crafted interesting concepts but not a world i was totally interested in","1646":"i was disappointed in this book i thought it would be more about the game and him writing the pathways and details of the players i was really excited to read it about half way through i stopped reading for about a week because i had lost interest i forced myself to skim over the remainder of the book but it didn't regain my interest","1647":"a dark confusing yet eloquent pathway into existential abyss musings on purpose and destiny a worthy read","1648":"often i like books in which it's hard to decide whether or not to like and sympathize with a character this is how i felt most of the time while reading this is sean a misunderstood lonely outsider or a morally ambiguous punk i'm glad that i had to get to the end before i was ready to make up my mind also i love the title","1649":"as a fan of darnielle's music this book initially felt like opening that packed hall closet only to have years worth of mountain goats lyrics and possible unwritten song plots bury me in an avalanche and then a crazy amazing thing happened john darnielle the musician disappeared and i forgot where i was for the rest of the book the only thing i knew was sean's world sean's brutally exposed and painful yet still desperately somewhat optimistic world wow john wow","1650":"an odd book like reading a dream fascinating and original","1651":" tsome times i have a very hard time expressing why i like a book this makes me terrible at reviews its hard for me to express that i connected to this character in an odd way wolf in white van is about sean phillips who is your quintessential 80's early 90's metal kid he listened to heavy metal played dungeons and dragons tried to commit suicide ok maybe not your quintessential metal kid but this book really good job in expressing the after effects of destroying your life the relief you feel in finally being able to show your inner demons to the world the way of having your outer self portray your inner self this book haunts me in a good way this book came the closes to explaining the odd paradox of being apart of the obsessive counter cultural that is being a geek or nerd of spending so much of your time escaping from real life and living in a fantasy world how fandom is both isolating and makes you apart of a larger social experience of being able to connect with people who like the same things you do this book was so many things it gave me a protagonist that aloud me to revel in a dark side of my personality a side that i didn't even know how to come to terms with this book was a fantastic look at the dark side of obsessive geek culture and i thoroughly enjoyed it i was also disturbed by it this is a book that would be hard for me to recommend to any one else because my reaction to it was so personal but yet something that i want every one to read because it was so polarizing to me this is a book that i would be proud to have on my book shelf at home and from time to time will reread it to see how my opinions have changed","1652":"an odd twisting beautiful book it's compelling and curiously constructed if at times a bit faltering and unfocused darnielle is a wonderful writer it's easy and pleasant to fall into the rhythm of his prose some of the scenes i found the most memorable and well written are completely incidental to the plot but utterly vivid and life like i'm thinking of the radio that awakens sean and his internal monologue the climax is chilling and faulknerian recommended","1653":"very strange and depressing best thing about this book it was short","1654":"satisfyingly unsatisfying addresses the evolving nature of satanic panic disjointed like the protagonist's memory i think the book's world and concepts work better than the narrative itself","1655":"huh this book unfolds almost like a mystery due to the reverse chronological order except without a surprise ending mostly i wanted more from it and more words allocated opposite to reality for example you get a very one dimensional view of the conservative parents yet it's the same thing over and over again i'm missing backstory and substance that could bring the story to life more i also like many others on goodreads wanted more of trace italian which the book jacket misleadingly promises don't take my word for it read jessica's review i don't know her but she captures my exact thoughts about wolf in a white van","1656":" one of the most brilliant books i've read in a long time as a long time fan of the mountain goats the band i was excited to see this book pop up in my favorite literary podcast literary disco such an incredible work telling the story of a man who has been disfigured by a tragic event who plays out his life in a send away role playing game he created while hospitalized and now runs as some one familiar with paper and pencil rp games this books captures that alluring feeling of being drawn into a world as an escape the entire thing is an emotional rollercoaster that captures the frailty of a life of loneliness and beauty all at once i can't say enough about it go read this book right now also the author recorders the audio book which i listened too which adds a whole new level of drama so check that out if you want the full experience","1657":"i have sorely neglected goodreads recently much to my own shame having just finished this novel i felt a force compel me to record the extremity of feeling in my heart now i return to the void","1658":"effectively sad and depressing without the sharp cut of his lyrics it's a bit like holden caulfield as the elephant man","1659":"tedious and uninteresting how anyone could enjoy this book is beyond me","1660":"love the mountain goats this guy can tell a story","1661":"a fractured kaleidoscopic story like a mountain goats song expanded into a full blown confessional with a familiar southern california landscape denuded and drained of color","1662":" wolf in white van tells the story of sean phillips a reclusive game designer whose face has been severely disfigured from a self inflicted gunshot wound a failed suicide attempt alternating between different moments in sean's life he describes the reactions people have to his appearance and the experience he has meeting people before and after the shooting having recovered from his injury sean earns a small income from his very own play by mail role playing game called trace italian the writing was nothing short of spellbinding debut author john darnielle who hails from bloomington indiana and is the singer songwriter for the mountain goats writes in lengthy lyrical sentences a rather stream of unconsciousness style not unlike his music what i found especially enthralling was how the fractured narrative served to mirror sean's fractured personality i'm quite partial to the story's open ended conclusion though admittedly i really wanted to know what the future held for sean i'm certainly content with this ending though other readers will be left with many questions after they finish the last page don't get me wrong though--this book is genuine and deserves to be read although much of the subject matter is gravely serious it is an engaging story from cover to cover the writing alone makes it a worthwhile read vivid and profound wolf in white van is one of the best books i've read in a long while laced with authenticity and peppered with compelling metaphors and colorful language--and let's not forget the lengthy exegesis of 80s cult film krull a favorite from my childhood --this is an absolute must read","1663":"this is a beautiful little book about moments that define us and those around us told both forwards and backwards until they meet in the catalyst and crescendo of the story a better review to come at some point in the future but really just do yourself a favor and read it","1664":"an interesting read if not a real page turner i'm left scratching my head as to how much i really enjoyed it and i think john darnielle in this his debut novel hasn't done a great job of balancing his personal interests against the interests of his readers still short and sweet","1665":"john darnielle's wolf in white van is best debut novel of 2014 darnielle's prose is just as beautiful as his songwriting with wolf ranking only behind the mountain goat's all hail west texas in his superb body of work it's a bleak tale with a complexity that makes multiple reads almost mandatory but darnielle has crafted some of the most awesome sentences that rival james salter which makes the necessary re visits a joy highly recommended","1666":"i distrust reviewers that call something slow paced but this perhaps to to reflect the main character's life was snailish small and slow despite big things that had happened just nothing much went on here you could tell this was a novel written by a poet more than a storyteller it was weird to read this along with dark places because they're both kind of about the same thing but told and revealed in wildly different ways","1667":"a moody atmospheric meditation on trauma and coping the power of imagination even puerile imagination to build bridges between isolated lives the emotional volatility of youth its desperate search for outlets our fraught relations with parents and the alien planet between our ears the novel has its flaws which others have noted but it also has moments of intense lyricism and feeling you couldn't ask much more of a debut","1668":" having been a fan of the mountain goats since i was twelve i had unbelievably high hopes for john darnielle's debut novel wolf in white van that man can write truly beautiful lyrics he can craft astute observations about people and their characters he can distill the essence of experience into a three minute ballad so what is this none of that is in this novel the language is common and montonous there are some fine moments sentence wise but it is overall inconsistent sean the protagonist and narrator is really only a caricature of all of those du0026amp d playing weirdos and what exactly was revealed about anything that said the structure of the novel is sort of inspired sean's role playing game trace italian asks players to seek out an impenetrable fortress where they can survive mutant aggressors it is significant that he acknowledges that there is no end to this game the players will always be strung along and that is the journey of the character the journey inward away from society the reverse chronological order of the novel suggests a series of steps that like falling dominoes creates a chain of causation but that self reflexivity isn't always great as when the sean takes a moment to point out that try as he might he can't stand mystery novels this is probably a sly comment of the fact that the novel itself is sort of presented as a mystery but withholds an obvious payoff the only problem with that is that there is no goddamned tension in the entire book everytime one of the three central mysteries was resolved what happened to the kids what happened to his face and near the end why did that happen to him i just kind of frowned each revelation is so inane it plays as comedy the journey and its religious possibilities are a tad strange there is a lot of talk about god and the devil and i think it all just goes back to the novel's central obsession with choice why do our lives play out as they do is there a good choice and a bad one sean certainly seems convinced of it this is so minor but i'm going to put it in here anyway was i supposed to pick up on conman vibes from sean the way he tried to pass off the endlessness of the game as a good thing was strange when he's reaping the benefit of the continued subscriptions it is in his best interests to prolong the game to continue to have a salary hm what could this suggest about that journey of isolation i really really wanted to like this book and i did like parts of it i just don't think there was a lot going on there's some interesting stuff about the influence of creative works on individuals the concepts of choice and freewill and the burden and comfort of isolation but it just reads too much like a first novel things are not finessed enough characters are thin they pass in and out aimlessly redundancies abound the next book will probably be better 2 books i thought were going to be about a child predator in a creepy white van out of 5","1669":"astonishing book simple but astonishing no seriousl go away and read it and then come back and tell me how much you agree","1670":"i had an extraordinarily emotional experience with this book much of that has to do with darnielle's exploration of a world very similar to the one in which i spent my teen years conan comics shitty rock magazines role playing games and on but just as much is down to the power of the prose there were sections that made me just put the book down and smile shake my head stare out the window an extremely sad often surreal book with a core of truth i can testify to i loved it","1671":" wolf in white van is one of the greatest books i've ever read i started it yesterday morning and finished it this afternoon carrying it with me as i walked between classes and postponing homework to get in just one more chapter the writing confidently plants profundity within its readability author john darnielle lead singer songwriter of the alt folk group the mountain goats effortlessly translates his songwriting skills into prose telling the non linear story of sean phillips a man with an obsession with fringe fantasy pop culture and a severe facial deformity from an incident in his teenage years and the mastermind behind trace italian a turn based post apocalyptic fantasy adventure game that is played through the mail via letters sent back and forth between sean and the game's subscribers of whom there are enough to pay sean's insurance and rent the novel's brilliance lies in its structure the primary direction darnielle takes the story is backwards beginning with a moment of peaceful equilibrium in sean's life then chronicling a heart rendering incident of two of trace italian's players who lost the ability to differentiate the game from reality followed by sean's early optimism when he begins sending out the game all the while building its way towards the incident that deformed sean and changed the course of his life darnielle is smart in how he paces sean's story conveying his perception of civilization's rejection of him and the physical and emotional pain he feels without ever becoming maudlin or defeatist moving seamlessly between melancholy existentialism humor and reclusion as the story proceeds darnielle eases us into the story's ultimate theme the power of narrative and how the stories we place ourself in can give us power and destroy us the latter is particularly resonant as the narrative reaches its grim conclusion beginning an ending projected to the reader long in advance but whose specifics and context will still horrify wolf in white van firmly establishes what will hopefully be a prominent new voice in fiction and tells an intimate yet massive story about the nature of seclusion the effect pop culture has on us and the power of stories in which we see ourselves as the heroes ironically due to the extremely analog nature of the game at the novel's center wolf in white van may be the first great novel of the digital era making us think about a world where all of us live as a variation on sean phillips casting out our own turns to our friends and our followers many of whom will never actually know who we are masterfully written compellingly readable and quietly profound wolf in white van is a small masterpiece a universe you know you must take some time to comprehend yet one know you will definitely revisit in the future","1672":"as in his music darnielle infuses the quiet mundanity of existing with great significance as likely to wax poetic about a yes cassette tape case as he is the nature of god it's a pretty requiem for the hilarious indomitable dangerous lonely young selves that we tried to kill for whatever reason but didn't finish off","1673":"review coming later","1674":"i thought it was a solid piece of literary fiction","1675":"i really enjoyed this one it has a fantastic premise that drew me in but then ended up being much more meditative and insightful than i was expecting the book is full of lovely writing and wonderful characters that show rather than tell you who they are it's more of a painting than a literal version of what happened and sometimes i prefer that though it takes a little getting used to at first i was a little confused by the last few chapters but as time went on and i thought about it more it all coalesced for me in a different way than just a simple mystery explained i will be thinking about it for a while to come i am sure","1676":"i hated it and then loved it and then it lost me at the end","1677":"because of my own personal past this was a difficult read for me it might deserve 5 stars but i can't tell because i am too emotionally invested in the subject matter involved it hurt to read no spoilers but i would warn anyone who is sensitive to topics of violence and self harm tread carefully","1678":" wolf in white van is a perfect novel it's so perfect in fact that i'm having a hard time coming up with anything to write about it so please allow me to digress for a few minutes in the hopes that it will bring me around to actually writing about the book i'm supposedly writing about i'd not heard of john darnielle before picking up this book fortunately the penultimate line of his bio on the jacket didn't turn me off completely to wit he is widely considered one of the best lyricists of his generation i've worked in publishing long enough to know he wrote that line himself as such it would have been much better and less nakedly self promoting if he'd instead written the new yorker hailed him as 'america's best non hip hop lyricist ' or something similar widely considered gack but like i say i got past this and read the book anyway and it's amazing i mentioned that didn't i hey i just learned that darnielle was born in bloomington indiana that's where i grew up does this matter in any meaningful way of course not william t vollmann and i went to the same high school though not at the same time and this doesn't matter either but darnielle's bloomington connection will probably stick in my head anyway have i started talking about the book yet nope dammit i'm flipping through it now and remembering all of the pop cultural touchstones darnielle and i share dungeons u0026amp dragons rush family ties conan bad heavy metal krull hit parader vcrs vcrs that's a pop cultural touchstone everybody had a vcr in the '80s um libya man this review is a mess here's the thing i so fully inhabited this book as i was reading it which i accomplished in just two days not much of a feat given its length but still that i feel like it happened to me i'm not saying i feel like i shot myself in the face and am suffering the repercussions of that senseless act for decades as sean the book's protagonist does or even that i invented a complex on paper fantasy adventure game that indirectly caused the deaths of two players but the character of sean felt so true that he might as well have been sitting in my room telling this story to me as opposed to me reading it by myself the experience was that mesmerizing i'm sure that i was mesmerized in large part because of the synchronicity of darnielle's and my previously and poorly alluded to cultural touchstones perhaps that's it i didn't feel like sean per se but i did feel like i'd grown up with sean he was the friend i never had in high school the guy i lost touch with after his horrifying accident can it be called an accident if he did it on purpose twenty years later i discovered that i missed talking to him hanging out with him but by then it was what too late or too embarrassing our mutual abandonment having been indicative of a need to move on socially despite his life having changed catastrophically and mine having changed not much at all i realize i'm still not really talking about the book perhaps because the book is so good that i'm too close to it to talk about it without talking about my experience with it i suppose i should wait and discuss it after i've been able to put some distance between us that won't happen the waiting to discuss i mean not the distance which will inevitably maybe john darnielle is one of the best lyricists of his our generation i guess i need to find some mountain goats albums now","1679":"this delivered something but neither what i was desiring nor what i was expecting if i had actually read more about this book before reading it i probably would not have read it so it goes when you try to stay 'pure' you get burned every now and then i kind of regret spending the time but then again it wasn't all that long it just didn't give me something new to think about which sounds terrible to say about a book that the author clearly cared about writing but there it is","1680":"i've heard this talked up quite a bit so i was pleased when it was selected for this month's book club selection darnielle has a knack for structure and world creation through detail which if you've heard his music you already know to be true good fast read but not great","1681":"call it a 3 5 i really enjoyed the book though parts of it felt canned and sloppy the interiority of the main character his metal and conan obsessions was well rendered and i was very happy with the fantasy game as life metaphor","1682":"i read this book almost in one sitting engrossed in the gravity that is a story progressing backwards to the terrible event that defines it if you listen to the mountain goats this is a new depth to the songs we all know by heart to be disfigured to be a teenager simultaneously guileless and menacing this novel is a deep study of the panic that exists only in quiet places","1683":" the narrator in this book sean is a recluse this isn't entirely by his choosing--an injury he suffered as a teenager has left him disfigured enough that going out in public is a trial he'd just as soon avoid for his own sake as well as everyone else's he is also in substantial physical pain most of the time which can make dealing with other people more of a chore than a joy so he is by his nature as well as his circumstances a philosopher he is also a man with a powerful imagination there are suggestions that his imagination is part of what got him in trouble in the first place but he tells us it's also what saved him during the long tortured weeks he spent in the hospital recovering from his nearly fatal wounds his imagination began creating a game it's a role playing game he calls \"trace italian \" set in a post apocalyptic wasteland america where the fortresslike trace is the only place of safety upon his release from the hospital he began working on the game in earnest eventually creating the means of his own survival in the real world players who subscribe to the game send him money in order to play and for the last twenty years that money has paid his bills it's how he makes enough to live independently from his parents with whom he has always had a difficult relationship what little plot there is in this story revolves around the game two teen aged players with imaginations seemingly as powerful as his took the game from fantasy to reality one of them died the other was so damaged by frostbite that there are suggestions his life will end up very similar to sean's this tragedy impinges on sean's quiet life and shakes him up enough that he feels the need to share his story with someone with us it's the story of a misfit a boy \"small for his age\" who spends his adolescence reading comic books listening to outliers' music and dwelling in worlds of dark dark fantasy his story sounds a lot like at least one kid we all knew in high school or maybe the one kid we were the title of the book refers to a legend every teenager knows about music that some song lyrics when played backwards reveal mysterious and disturbing messages in some circles like the televangelists sean finds himself watching late at night those disturbing messages are straight from satan himself in other circles satan exists only to explain the unexplainable the things too horrible too unfair or just too wrong to be made sense of sean's story centers on one such thing both its genesis and its aftermath are too awful to imagine at the end of what seemed like a pretty good day for a seventeen year old--hanging out with friends listening to music getting to make out with a girl--sean took a step that would have life altering implications for him why we ask as we usually do in stories like this sean lets us down gently he confesses early in the story that the safe center of the trace italian doesn't really exist or it does but \"no one will ever live\" long enough to reach it that's his warning to us he will not answer our question this time like the wolf in the white van it's just satan but that doesn't mean the story isn't worth reading it is in fact one of the most powerful books i've read this year sean is obsessed by the twists and turns of his game where at the end of each turn the player must make a choice and that choice dictates how the rest of the game will go he constantly compares the game to the choices he has made in his life and eventually we see that he's talking about that other game we all play... the one that none of us will live long enough to reach the center of but we keep going","1684":" when i was growing up with three brothers it usually felt like gender was fluid and semi imaginary a concept that my parents used to excuse behaviors from my brothers while punishing them from me but other times it truly seemed that adolescent boys were another planet inexplicable barren and remote the fact that they were the stars of all the books and media i encountered a societal conspiracy meant to trick me into thinking that they were also human so to a certain extent this book feels like a truth finally acknowledged like i am an alien abductee discovering others like me in some dark corner of the internet","1685":"hard to believe this isn't darnielle's day job he goes so deep inside a quirky disturbed psyche it's as if this were his 20th novel","1686":"i was sure at the end of part one that this was going to be a new favorite book that i would recommend to everyone now i'm not sure what i want to say about it it's a good book to read but a hard book to recommend","1687":"one of those books that really makes you think about what it's trying to say instead of giving it to you directly","1688":"astounding accomplishment from a first time novelist the world created is rich and complex the story is at once incredibly foreign and very relatable the only dark cloud on the horizon is the worry that the author's subsequent release might not live up to his maiden effort if it's not a one hit wonder darnielle should prove to be a fantastic resource for years to come","1689":"2 5 3this was average i honestly don't have any super strong opinions about this book positive or negative although i found it confusing at times i kind of liked not knowing what was going on and piecing together and figuring out the plot as i read on the other hand the stream of consciousness style of writing made the timeline of the book very uncertain for me i'm still not sure when some events took place in relation to others although i could definitely relate to the protagonist's use of his own imagination as a defense mechanism and a form of escape i couldn't understand his motivation for the pivotal act in the story like at all like i read it a couple of times to try and get the meaning out if it i didn't so all in all an interesting book but that's about the highest praise i'm willing to give it","1690":"sean the narrator of this illuminating novel on random violence and self harm is the post millennial generation x cousin to salinger's holden caulfield but where salinger uses caulfield as a way to meditate on the post wwii american anxiety sean's sense of loss and fear is an internal ennui impossible to locate or comprehend yet appropriate to an age where the cold war has evolved into ones we wage on substances drugs or states of being terror there are moments of deep sadness humor and horror all mixed up with a first person perspective the reader can't always call reliable i liked it a lot","1691":"very wasp factory this one iain banks definitely had the edge in the style department but darnielle's take on the tormented protagonist with a disfigurement of mysterious origin is less pretentious and more believable by leaps and bounds","1692":" if you enjoy books that contain important flashbacks and multiple personalities then wolf in white van is the book for you sean phillips the main character suffers from a self inflicted gun shot to the head at age 17 this action caused facial disfigurement this story contains segments from different parts of sean's life describing reactions to his appearance there is a little altercation that leads sean's parents to believe that his friend kimmy convinced sean to shoot himself sean plays a game that contains a sense of apocalyptic united state this novel ends with a flashback of sean contemplating on whether to kill himself or himself and his parents this story is a one that will make you want to keep reading and intrigued if you ever find yourself reading this book before you need to be somewhere i suggest otherwise unless you intend on being late this novel truly captures the intensity of gaming whether you are a video game feign or a video game hater you will finally understand the influences a video game can have i believe that this book is not only for entertainment but its also for educational purposes with teaching importance of gaming to some made others realize the true level of addiction it can have to a person sean brings out fantastic adventures where possibilities both dark and bright open in the boundaries between the real and the imagined he states \"i always wonder if people are afraid of me because they think i'll do something press my face up against them or start making funny noises i am always a little tempted to satisfy their fears \" and \"i knew she wanted to ask what i was doing but i had the advantage nobody liked to see me speak \" these are excerpts from the story that shows the thought processes of this individual trace italian one of the games that influences his thoughts is where he can live purely in imagination and occasionally connecting with a few other people in the world who see things the way he does--or almost the novel moves through time and space so fluidly that the story encapsulated within is the story of the way this man will move through his life forever the story moves backwards and goes deeper where you find out more and more about the case and what happened in sean's accident i really connected to themes of participating in game play and fantasy worlds of books and movies and how you must not let them consume you through a collage of memory observation and expert narration of the author john darnielle places readers into the mind of sean the grown survivor of a traumatic teenage accident that destroyed a good portion of his face it is also very different this read is something intriguing suspenseful and unlike anything else i have ever read it just left me wondering if i weren't a person who hates repetition i would read this book over and over again i recommend this book to all readers","1693":"i really enjoyed reading this and read it in one sitting it was original and well written and a trip down memory lane with regards to the play by mail games proper old school i think john darnielle dealt with the subject matter excellently no spoilers and it's a book worthy of your time an excellent first novel read and enjoy","1694":"just what you'd expect from darnielle meaning some of the greatest shit you'll ever fucking read in your life ever holy jesus fucking christ goddamnit","1695":"there is a smell a taste a pained sense of the world in this book fascinating and well written reminds me of a pain i haven't known since high school","1696":" this book pulled me in there were a lot of pieces to the puzzle that made up this story that were so vague and i just kept going with it because i really wanted to know what happened the book doesn't follow any sort of linear structure some of it feels in the past some feels in the present although the present time of the story is actually in the past considering it's set maybe a decade or more ago eventually you start to piece the overall tale together it's possibly hard to give too much description without giving away too many pieces of the puzzle but the gist is that the story is about a guy who has had some sort of accident who spends his days working on a mail order choose your own adventure type of game but the game itself has also led to another tragic accident part of me wishes the story had gone more in depth with the guy's own feelings and thoughts especially leading up to the accident because i finished it still feeling lost and not able to fully understand him or his actions completely but then i realized that isn't necessarily a bad thing i don't think you are really supposed to fully put together that piece of the puzzle or maybe you are or your project your own self into things in any case whatever i did end up getting out of this book was a lot and i really did enjoy it it's not exactly a fun read but it was fast moving and something different","1697":"this book is much darker than most of the things i read but it is a very gripping portrayal of one man's journey coping with depression and the effects of his actions","1698":"ugh i feel like two stars is pretty spot on i'm certainly in the camp of those absolutely puzzled by the great reviews and nomination for a prestigious award after reading a lot of reviews upon finishing this wiwv apparently did something for some readers but very little for me i would give it one star but i find myself grateful that it was only 207 pages so thanks for that i just don't get it","1699":"tcl call # f darniellejoe's rating 4 starsthis book was crazy good darnielle brings you into the mind of his main character with the vividness of his details yet he somehow keeps just enough away to keep you guessing and making you yearn to read on he explores how relationships can be cultivated without the people actually ever meeting each other yet in this day and age of modern technology darnielle explores this facet by going old school through a role playing game played through the mail bringing out details of each charaters life yet leaving out enough that your never really sure what is happening this juxtaposed with the situations in the game and the moves available really keeps you on the edge of your seat the only problem is the book loses a little steam when you finally find out how the main character become physically disfigured but still reads wonderfully","1700":"i love this little book so much that i'm nervous about recommending it to anyone i get that it's not for everyone wolf in white van is a series of disjointed small scenes filled with incredibly specific details i was not a teenage boy in the 80s and i don't like role playing games but i know some things about feeling isolated and darnielle captures it beautifully i enjoyed learning about the narrator through all the small weird observations but i didn't expect the ending to affect me as strongly as it did i loved the book even more the second time","1701":"started this because of the game stuff but it really wasn't about that it was really different and very hard to listen to at times but i didn't hate it definitely a different type book for me","1702":"huh i like to think i'm a fairly savvy reader but i just did not get it i mean i got the plot it just didn't add up to anything for me there was no twist no surprise not much of anything the blurb makes it sound sooo much better than it is","1703":"the world in this book is so small and isolated entirely within the head of someone whose head i am happy not to spend any more time in","1704":" i heard about this book on npr and immediately wanted to read it i started the book then walked away from it for about a week then read the rest in one sitting the book was okay it's short only a little over 200 pages and i believe that worked against the storyline i feel very unresolved after finishing the book i don't believe any of the characters or the plot was developed as well as they could have should have been this book has a lot of potential but left me feeling flat and wondering about the point of it all","1705":"twists and turns and twists and turns are there any correct moves","1706":"i loved it because john darnielle has a magical way with words and being able to absolutely capture the human condition but i really feel like i'll need to reread this one to figure out what was happening in the plot","1707":"a fast read i liked the main character seemed to end abruptly","1708":"very well written but disturbing","1709":"this remarkable little volume turns out to be able the dangers of the interpretation of art which sounds really boring but it's not it's a page turner from the beginning to the end think of it as holden caulfield does the 21st century i'm still mulling it over","1710":" john darnielle once named \"america's best non hip hop lyricist\" by the new yorker is the lead singer of the popular folk rock band the mountain goats his songs often revolve around characters experiencing moments of great change selling acid to a cop the break up of a high school death metal band running away from an abusive step father it shouldn't be surprising that his debut novel wolf in white van also revolves around a transformative event wolf in white van is a lean and dense novel told from the perspective of sean phillips we quickly learn that our protagonist has been hideously disfigured from a horrific \"accident\" age 17 he lives in extreme pain and with a shocking facial disfigurement - his rare trips to the mall require immense courage and garner unwanted intention because of this wolf in white van mostly takes place in sean's fragmented memories and intense imagination hardly venturing outside of his bedroom walls sean writes a text based fantasy game called the trace italian for a living the trace italian named after a style of walled fortification takes place in an unforgiving american post apocalypse it is highly structured and run by snail mail its loyal players willingly put themselves under the will of sean's terrifying imagination devoted to finding the safe room rumored to lay in the heart of his fortress the players find themselves pulled into sean's hungry and strangely intoxicating act of escapism to sometimes tragic results 'technically \" sean says \"it's possible to get to the last room in the final chamber of the trace italian but no one will ever do it no one will ever live that long \" likewise wolf in white van holds no real catharsis no didactic message no resolution readers instead traverse the disturbing depths of sean's feral imagination in excruciating detail slowly unraveling pieces of his guilt and weaknesses edging closer and closer to his disfiguring act through sean we get to fully experience the world of an outcast who lives almost entirely in interior spaces a person who draws out maps and battles in the hospital ceiling in order to survive a person whose childlike vulnerability is hidden underneath so many layers of cynical fortifications that when we do finally catch glimpses of it we are surprised by his humanity the result is at once both unsettling and strangely moving sean's observations are so fiercely intimate that it is hard to believe that his voice could be completely a work of fiction when john darnielle writes about pain he talks about it like an insider his childhood was fraught with abuse he worked as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital for teenagers later in his life he and his girlfriend were arrested for heroin possession we know about this because darnielle has put them into story - concise folksongs that paint poignant vignettes of people often himself learning how to survive profound pain and loss darnielle knows the draw escapism here in the form of storytelling has for the rejected and the outsiders in wolf in white van the imagination is presented as an almost magical force with the abilities to both shelter and destroy in sean's world conan the barbarian death metal court trials correspondence with his players convenience stores childhood backyards and late night evangelical talk shows all inform the dark interior architecture of his twisted fantasies the \"outside world\" terrifyingly complicated and relentlessly unforgiving only exists to inform the safety of his imagination for sean the mind is the only refuge where you are truly safe - the only place where you can rule with complete certainty but as wolf in white van forewarns while the imagination may give you the ability to escape and survive it has the very real power to also serve as the catalyst to tragedy ultimately for sean \"faced with the choice of either inventing internal worlds or having no world at all to inhabit \" this is a risk he is willing to make","1711":"okay i didn't know this author's name apparently he is the lead singer composer lyricist chief bottle washer for an indie folk group called \"the mountain goats\" so i gave this book no special pass when i sat down to read it i was reading across the genre of ya fiction although admittedly no young adult myself to get a feel for what is au courant there and i noted that this book came recommended by critics and had been a finalist for the national book award and the title let's agree is intriguing i think this work was masterfully constructed there are two things we need to find out more about as we read on--just what happened and why to a young teen couple who were participating in an alternate world role playing strategy game called trace italian using an archaic time consuming method called the u s mail and how and why sean the man who created this imaginary world and controls the flow of the game and responses to all participants suffered some horribly disfiguring tragedy as a teen years ago darnielle shows great skill and just the right amount of restraint in how he slowly reveals more about each of these narratives one in the book's past and the other in its present as he also demonstrates a poetic command of language i give him credit where credit is due i would never recommend this to a teen--especially not a teen coping with any issues of self doubt or a sense of not belonging this is lyrical language but bleak bleak bleak in its delivery and ultimately offering only emptiness and despondency no insight or even the glimmer of a chance to feel hope when you put the book down perhaps this is considered artistic and daring i reject the worldview that actions of self destruction can be seen as daring liberation in a way we might admire or that those who do so are privy to a greater truth with a capital t i am against all types of censorship so i would never ban this book but the book itself raises a relevant moral question do those who knowingly through targeted art and entertainment encourage the depressed and unstable to wallow in suffering or even worse tease them into acts of self destruction have any responsibility for their complicity","1712":"interesting book by john darnielle of the mountain goats his first novel a little frustrating but a good character study and like his songs the writing is great","1713":"interesting read quick","1714":"i'll be the first to admit that my opinion of john darnielle's wolf in white van is probably biased i'm a huge mountain goats fan and i was looking forward to this novel for quite a long time i also connect with the protagonist sean in a lot of ways i love robert e howard role playing games etc while i've never had an urge to blow off my own face there are days when i can understand the decision perhaps this novel which not everyone agrees myself included should be longlisted for an nba will appeal more to that special class of geek the middle schoolers on the periphery with more baggage than what can fit in a midsize car i liked the structure of the novel the dust jacket will tell you that it starts at the end and works its way backwards which isn't necessarily false but it doesn't play out the same way chris nolan's memento does it works its way up to the climax the story continues to unfold a little bit at a time and reads almost as if the narrator is backtracking poking and prodding his memory to get at the source of his despair he mentally replays significant moments of his youth like a reel of film and at times it can feel like you the reader are noticing things that the sean is not because the story is distilled through his point of view there were times when i was left with more questions than answers relatively speaking certain \"major\" events that seem like natural focal points for a novel aren't parsed and examined as carefully as i desired however i appreciated the fact that the narrator was forthright about this in his own charming disturbing nihilistic way he explains that he doesn't have an answer for everything and as i got into the latter part of the novel i started to agree with him his parents therapists and doctors all create this narrative of events that satisfies their own need for clear cut answers it becomes infuriating to withstand all of these third parties trying to structure a series of events that are quite chaotic in nature in some ways this becomes a metaphor for human nature in this vein the novel doesn't really have one particular point nor should it there's a lot to say about its treatment of time religion authority solipsism memory etc i still haven't clearly outlined in my mind what the title means in relation to the story nor the fact that sean's fantastic imagination borders a religious experience if you're not into postmodern literature this isn't the book for you the narrative takes its reader from one point to another dropping them off in a deserted wasteland much like the trace italian and laying out only the crudest outline of possible paths i believe the reader chooses what the story means in the same way one chooses his or her own adventure in the role playing game of sean's construction","1715":" i liked this more than i thought i would the reviews of some of my goodreads friends lead me to believe i wouldn't like this book much but i did enjoy it there is an undercurrent of vague menace throughout the novel the protagonist sean phillips was disfigured by a gunshot wound at age 17 his face is so horrible as a result that he rarely leaves his house he earns his living by supporting a game he wrote trace italian the game takes place in the post apocalyptic future various weird and bad things seem to happen around him without his direct agency in them many things in the book remain vague and inexplicable and there are many loose ends however this seems entirely appropriate to the character and his life there are many things about him that are unexplained and unexplainable he's a certain type of unreliable narrator he's not unreliable because he lies he doesn't he is a narrator that doesn't understand himself or his life very well if you like every loose end tied up and resolved you won't like this book if you can live with ambiguity and in fact welcome it you may enjoy it","1716":" i was already a fan of john darnielle through the mountain goats in his music he has such a fantastic way of telling beautiful heartwrenching stories in each song it makes perfect sense to me that he would also be an author i wasn't disappointed i listened to an interview with darnielle about this book and he explained that when something bad happens you want to be able to blame it on something but you can't always do that this book is just a series of events that happened around something bad it really does a beautiful job of creating a narrative where there isn't necessarily one to be had it was a quick brilliant read","1717":" i'm not a casual 5 star rater this is an excellent book it isn't about the narrator's game or his legal troubles or his accident or his guilt it's really about the mild but incessant pain of loneliness sean doesn't fit in with his family nor his friends nor his customers but darnielle takes us through this with nuanced emotion while darnielle does an excellent job setting up questions and providing reveals the book really becomes a morbidly entertaining journey toward getting to know the complicated but likable sean","1718":"at just over 200 pages darnielle's first book features writing that is spare and economical it doesn't waste your time and still packs an emotional punch sean the narrator is disfigured from an incident when he was a teenager and now 20 years later spends his time running a subscription based mail in strategy game until the actions of two teenage players make him confront his past","1719":"a pretty impressive debut novel that gets better the deeper you get into it it's rare to find an original voice for a character but darnielle really succeeds with this novel","1720":" once i picked this book up i couldn't put it back down i blazed through it in one sitting i was thoroughly engrossed in both sean's story and the trace italian a story unfolding in reverse wolf in white van is told in the first person because we're inside sean's head throughout the entire novel it forces us to see things from his perspective i loved the way it was constructed and how it seemed at times to jump randomly between thoughts everything ties up nicely in the end it was funny and thought provoking it made me wish that there were a game called trace italian that i could play i wanted to know sean","1721":"not a book i was expecting to like but it was well done and had plenty of minor twists in it that made it a really interesting read","1722":"impossible to describe sure to show up on many best of 2014 lists","1723":"some really great imagery of deserts large monoliths looming in the soul that cast shadows and lots of conan lore unfortunately it didn't all come together as nicely as i would have hoped i still really enjoyed this novel if darnielle had dove a little deeper into his subject matter it would have been an oustanding book","1724":" i wanted to love love love it instead i really appreciated it for what it was a short fragmented window into a short fragmented life the language engaged me on a game like level and for that i was intrigued because i felt it was my first real glimpse into a gamer's mind as such with the gamer conceit behind all that the language is it allowed me to explore the mental health concerns with ambivalence instead of concern i find it most helpful when mental health is framed not as an either or either healthy or unwell but rather as a both and both unbalanced and more realistic than anyone else around i'd recommend this to most but not all of my reading friends","1725":" have you ever wondered how much credence you put into the fictional worlds that your favourite fictional characters inhabit what if a fictional world was the only thing left to help you cope with extreme trauma perhaps a gross simplification but wolf in white van poses these questions through the actions and thoughts of its narrator sean phillips told in non chronological order wolf in white van is told entirely from the perspective of sean who's face is severely disfigured through events that become more clear throughout the novel sean operates an old school pen and paper survival game that forms the bulk of his life following the accident to say much more would be spoiling what is a really original and interesting read that is best unveiled on its own merits despite its short length ~200 pages the novel feels much more dense due to the rapid staccato of the chapters which move forwards and backwards in time like peeling off the layers of an onion from both inside and out the result is a really quite challenging though highly enjoyable reading experience i kept trying to piece together what the purpose of the story was trying to parse out hidden meaning trying to understand sean and the decisions he makes again without spoiling too much sean's narratorial voice keeps the book afloat during sections that could have dragged on without his wit and insight as a reader sean's story is compelling precisely because he holds little back from the audience you are forced to immerse yourself in sean's psyche to try and puzzle out what exactly this story is all about the cover which has to be one of the coolest covers in recent memory suggests the maze of the book you are about to enter indeed i found myself wondering more than a few times how the novel would resolve in a meaningful way and whether or not i'd be able to figure out what was going on this may make it sound like a frustrating read at times it is but i think it will also lend itself to many re reads in the future while i wouldn't recommend it to everyone wolf in white van is a unique reading experience that should pique the interest of any seasoned reader","1726":"well written but it could have used some of the humor darnielle invests his song lyrics with","1727":"strange left me feeling unsettled in a good way","1728":"i don't listen to the mountain goats but i want to now this is an impressive first novel it doesn't waste time builds mystery and some dread effectively and not ostentatiously and at its best recalls flannery o'connor without seeming like it's trying to i'd like to reread it again at some point i can't pin down everything i think about it which for a 200 page book i count as a positive","1729":"this book revolves around a main character who is living in the aftermath of massive physical trauma resulting in massive psychological trauma the author can be very insightful about what gives meaning to our lives but it is done in a very obtuse way i think i may re read it one day and see if i glean more from it when i am in a different frame of mind it reminded me in many ways of slow man by j m coetzee another book that i really liked but just didn't love","1730":" i'd give this six stars if i could darnielle really hits the mark hard with this one expanding on some of the most poignant themes found in his lyrics with just as much impact in prose written with true understanding not afraid to say there doesn't have to be meaning attached to even the most extreme events and for the weirdos who turned out ok hitting real close to home about how we define ourselves what we find important what sets us apart from the norms got me thinking about synthesizing the good and the bad about the spaces my mind occupied as a teen and beyond this is a hell of a book","1731":"full review at http www unadulterated us pink me 2","1732":"let me open up by telling you that this cover is splendid in a way the internet cannot portray it is shiny it is delightful wiggling the cover in different lighting situations is downright pleasurable the inside of the book is a thinker which is a thing that people say when they are ashamed to type that they have no idea what just happened the book runs backwards like the movie momento starting at the chronological last thing and moving toward the beginning so you start with the guy in i don't know middle age and work your way back to when he was a teenager it's revealed super early on that he's disfigured and he did something to himself to cause it he sustains his lifestyle by running a choose your own adventure mail in rpg game that he designed in the hospital oh and some kids killed themselves trying to play the game in real life the backwards structure isn't satisfying from either end there's no suspense payoff you know straight from the outset that he's not in jail so he obviously didn't get in trouble for causing the dead kids' death by the time the book works its way back there you know it doesn't become anything so you don't care about it sorry fictional dead kids when you finally get to the end chronological beginning you are pretty hyped to find out why he did this thing to himself but there isn't really an answer to that many people find open endedness like this intriguing but i was frustrated there are some really beautiful moments the writing itself is gorgeous the best part is a sequence talking about backmasking in rock music satan putting in messages backwards into the songs the protagonist watches the same program about backmasking twice but thinks he can find differences between them he is convinced that the things that repeat themselves are people pretending to do the same thing again instead of the same program twice this whole chapter of the book is so creepy it makes me think about how days feel the same but they're subtly different and maybe those differences matter and maybe they're sliding by maybe there are messages in there like backmasking another reviewer here postulated that telling the story backwards mirrored the segment about backmasking is the entire book then a story from satan what am i supposed to glean from that the book also talks about how one of the backmasked messages was wolf in the white van is that about depression how it lurks i don't know whether this book is deeply multi layered or tragically ill thought out and that frustrates me","1733":"i think he's been in my mind","1734":" take away someone's spirituality or never develop it in the first place and you're left with a gaping hole in sean's case that's quite literal as an incident with a rifle at 17 has left him permanently disfigured as we delve backward into sean's life a reoccurring theme of lost adolescents leaves the reader aching for all those who make bad choices as they struggle to find out who they really are sean the man bears only a passing resemblance to sean the teenager boy on several levels one constant is the black emptiness inside him that he never can quite fill by fair means or foul","1735":"i thought this was good and interesting but can't honestly say i liked it i'm giving it 3 stars anyways because i did appreciate the premise and the character development","1736":"i loved this book its narrative style is unconventional the book starts at the most recent event in the main character sean's life and moves backwards in time towards the climactic event that changed his life and it explains itself over and over again but it works because it really is about that one pivotal moment in sean's life the storytelling and writing are great and i could easily imagine this as a mountain goats album","1737":"even thought this had two things that i hate in books no humor taking an ordinary story and making a mystery of it by telling it backwards i really enjoyed it there was so much joy in the main character despite everything","1738":"i guess we're all afraid of spreading our diseases","1739":"in a review for wolf in white van i saw someone say that they wanted to hear more of lance and carrie's story regarding the trace italian they wanted to know why lance and carrie did what ultimately ended with carrie dead and lance very badly injured but as far as i can tell there is no point in what the did they didn't do it for a reason they just did it just like how sean just shot himself in the fucking face there wasn't a reason or if there was the person who did them didn't know let alone anyone else i have cut myself burnt myself and hit myself my self harm isn't the same as my suicidal tendencies when i'm suicidal i either want to die or can't handle life anymore but when i cut myself i just do it i don't do it because of anything i think maybe i do but i will never know what it is i will never know why i do that maybe i'm wrong but i think that that's what this book is about people do things they just do them as a fact without motivation or at least without any motivation that anyone will ever understand sure these actions are rare most of the time an action has a motivation behind it but sometimes you just do and then you either deal with the consequences or you regret regret regret regret regret regret that is what i felt in this book a sharp absence of regret i was putting myself in sean's head and thinking how the hell could you do this without regretting it then i thought of my self harm i don't regret it and i will never regret it no matter what the consequences are maybe it's connected to the fact that i don't know why i do it who knows certainly not me or sean or you or john darnielle or anyone i don't really know what my point is i'm bad at writing reviews or just putting thoughts into words in general but i do know that the vibe i got from this book is that you were not supposed to be given any closure to any of the stories whatever the point of the story was it doesn't matter you were just thrown into the middle of someones life so you get the middle you don't get a beginning or an end so you don't get to feel satisfied","1740":" wolf in white van is a brilliant debut novel it's filled with the kind of grand ambition that most new authors might be coached into reeling back in order to produce a more accessible work luckily for us readers however john darnielle an already celebrated musician and lyricist for the indie band the mountain goats is too confident an artist to be persuaded to hold back any of his genius the book's basic plot and series of events are told in reverse a difficult feat to pull off for any narrative but the backwards storytelling is just the surface structure for a book that further plays with time by shifting between past and present reality and fiction faded memories and splintered universes the book's narrator i would like to call him our protagonist but that could be a discussion unto itself is sean a middle aged southern california man who creates and manages a turn based role playing game company where the moves are sent in through snail mail instead of clicked through with a mouse his most popular game is trace italian a sort of nuclear holocaust doomsday simulation where players try to survive long enough to reach the eponymous trace italian a fictional fortress of serenity and safety hidden deep within a world full of horrors sean began creating the game in hospital beds at the age of 17 recovering from a gruesome event that's physically and philosophically shaped the entirety of his life ever since and is the pivotal moment through which all the events of the book even the ones that take place decades later are filtered the exact details of this event aren't explicitly described until the book's final pages but it's basic details are made known relatively early on and expanded upon in ominous and menacing ways as the story moves forward and backward sean's horrific past is brought into focus when he is called to account for an accident involving two players of his game high school kids who sean has no relation to but who's fates seem linked in mysterious ways to the spirit of sean's younger self and both the choices he has made in his own life and the choice structure he has created for players of trace italian while wolf in white van's themes are familiar outsider youth father son conflicts bullying school violence physical disfigurement existential behavior they are entombed structurally and emotionally in a layered riddle that mirrors sean's life lonely sudden unpredictable unsafe and ultimately unsolvable it's a puzzle that has no answer just like how sean reveals to us midway though the book that there is no real end to trace italian there is no possibility of reaching the sanctity of the promised fortress without such an answer one could justifiably worry that the book will be unsatisfying but i didn't find that be the case in the slightest there are powerful moving cathartic moments in this book despite its tendency to linger on the darker side of human nature its lack of a traditional conclusion will upset only those who weren't paying attention to one of the very first passages in the book where sean defines a particular childhood memory as a cluster memory that consists every time it happened and is recalled in a continuous loop there is a definite looping quality to the book subtle descriptions mentioned in the very first chapter take on whole new meanings on its second read indeed this is a book intended to be revisited soon after its initial reading and i can't help but think that's why darnielle decided to keep its length at just over 200 pages wolf in white van is a wonderful rumination on reality fate and the way some people seemed tragically destined to trudge through loneliness both as a child and an adult its language is as lyrical and soft as it is haunted and dark if it were possible to play a book on a turntable in reverse i have no doubt that it would reveal even more chilling messages that would shake us our core","1741":"i had a hard time finishing this book if it weren't so short i may not have the story itself is interesting but i struggled to keep my motivation to read up","1742":"mesmerizing possibly not for everyone but i couldn't put it down","1743":"i loved this book even though the subject matter is a little grim the story is so well thought out that it doesn't matter the images and world that the author conjures up is so believable and encompassing that i didn't want it to end","1744":"loved it can't believe this was his first novel amazed","1745":"hahaha holy shit okay definitely a first full length novel type of book it struggles with finding a comfortable existence somewhere between being innovative and using established tropes from off the wall types like vonnegut pynchon and wallace probably feels more comfortable being talked about in the same breath as jennifer egan i e good squad and or some of cheryl strayed's lighter work as sugar","1746":"overall it was an interesting book but it wasn't quite what i expected i thought we would've gotten more about lance and carrie's story i can appreciate the focus on the main character though and his story about how he'd gotten to the point he did it was interesting how it was formatted that the entire thing worked backwards to the big moment that had been alluded to the entire time","1747":" wolf in white van is clearly a successful book in that it so thoroughly evoked a character and feeling unfortunately i didn't particularly like being enveloped by sean phillips sean is a troubled twenty something who survived a disfiguring accident and now interacts with the world almost exclusively through trace italian the role playing game he runs through the mail when two players take the game too seriously sean has to confront the circumstances that brought him to this point the more we learn about sean the more troubling his story is and the more uncomfortable it was to read i'm glad i read it and glad it's over","1748":" i've always thought that you could take any mountain goats song and make a novel out of it john darnielle manages to pack so much into those little songs they have an epic sweep yet what's left unsaid is often more powerful than anything contained in the lyrics in \"the best death metal band in denton \" http youtu be 4isxkmkdamq for example darnielle does not describe the revenge that jeff u0026amp cyrus plot the listener is left to imagine how terrible that vengeance will be in \"wolf in white van\" darnielle has more room than in one of his songs but there's still much that's left unsaid set in southern california and covering a span of time that includes some of my own time there darnielle renders a both an interior and exterior landscape that is eerily familiar to me desolate liquor store parking lots fast food restaurants limned by the setting sun wayward heavy metal kids sitting in the backs of pick up trucks christian broadcasters harping about satanic backward masking in rock music dungeons and dragons paranoia teenage ennui and the fragile line between fantasy and reality because this is a novel darnielle can develop his characters where in \"the best ever death metal band...\" jeff u0026amp cyrus are little more than ciphers we have here the fully realized sean phillips but this novel is short just over 200 pages so much is subtext and -- in my opinion -- that's what really counts \"wolf in white van\" is a haunted novel a novel that seems to bare the dark soul of the suburbs without fully revealing what makes it so dark loneliness isolation alienation -- all the stuff of adolescence -- contribute to it but its so more than that in one part of the book sean watches a tbn program in which a preacher discusses the aforementioned backward masking how satan can sneak subliminal messages into even the most innocent person's music rock music after all is the devil's tool to prove his point the tv preacher plays a supposedly christian rocker's music in reverse revealing a cryptic satanic communique \"wolf in white van \" it says when the tv preacher is pressed to explain how this message is satanic he babbles some gobbledygook about the symbol of the wolf a stand in for satan ancient cults he clearly doesn't know what the heck it means he just knows that it's evil that pretty much describes the dark undercurrent of this novel an unknowable darkness threatens all the book's characters many maybe most of them have already been sucked into the darkness or at least touched by it sean phillips is the prime example having been pulled into a vortex of darkness and emerged a survivor even though he is horribly marked by it others are not so lucky luck is relative the darkness kills them the thing is we never believe for a second that sean now well past adolescence has safely distanced himself from the darkness it's more like he's just barely clinging to the frayed ends of the light dangling over the swirling dark and he's losing his grip ...again","1749":"i like the author's style i appreciated the story even though it wasn't fleshed out as much as it could've been but ultimately it was anticlimactic","1750":"now that i've finished this book i can't be finished thinking about it i liked it but i didn't i don't understand why sean did what he did at the end of the book yet i felt absorbed into his head and his world and wondered what will happen to sean next","1751":"this is one of those books that took a while to pull me in whether it was the main character or the lack of a linear plot or the writing style the first several chapters definitely kept me at a distance luckily curiosity kept me reading because by the end i was getting lost lost in the best way possible within this character's world both real and imagined this one will definitely be worth returning to and i'm eager to read the author's second book","1752":" darnielle has the uncanny ability to put into words the darkest parts of ourselves as naturally as they occur within the mind the twisted thought processes of depression anxiety and existing outside of norms are written as they are matter of fact though darnielle writes them more beautifully than they are experienced his insights into the human condition and to loss and pain as always are a reminder of just how much humans do and can live through while still acknowledging that sometimes that is the worst part living through it","1753":"really interesting lyrically composed short read about 200 pgs","1754":"so good stayed with me every time i put it down one of my favorite portraits of a central character in a long time","1755":"wow listen to the audiobook it's a truly immersive experience","1756":"totally baffled why this book is getting rave reviews it's meh at best","1757":"fascinating plot interesting and likeable character this was an intriguing narrative that i would confidently recommend to anyone who is looking for something different than any book they've read","1758":"i was skeptical of this book i love john darnielle's music but wasn't expecting him to be a good fiction writer he is i found the story and the main character very interesting i felt like i was really able to get into the guys strange head i wasn't so into some of the more artsy aspects of the book certain passages were very hard for me to understand what their meaning and purpose was however as i age i feel like maybe i am having a harder time with metaphorical and referential writing sadly i am losing my imagination maybe anyway four stars because john darnielle greatly exceeded my expectations with this story","1759":"quite fascinating and gorgeously written i recommend to my game designer friends","1760":"this book went where i was completely not expecting the sase text based game was a lot of fun to read about and pulled me into the story right away yet the backstory on the reason for the main character's facial disfigurement slowly became the reason for racing to the emotional end of the book","1761":"this book was wonderful i really wanna play trace italian","1762":"very well written the majority of the book is internal almost stream of consciousness it's not plot driven but it's still a page turner one of the best books i've read in awhile definitely recommend","1763":" i feel about wolf in white van about the same way i feel about john darnielle's band the mountain goats i should like this i really want to like it if you look at my tastes this should totally be my cup of tea but alas it just didn't speak to me it's not bad per se--it's a dark complex topic and a well written novel sean the narrator and main character is interesting but i just didn't care about him and i didn't care about his parents and i didn't give a rat's ass about lance and carrie or chris haynes or anyone else in the novel really i didn't find them at all relatable--i couldn't see myself within a hundred miles of their shoes the only character i found at all compelling was kimmy she was kind to sean and continued to visit him and treat him like a human being even after he was horribly disfigured and even though his deluded misguided parents somehow blamed her for his disfigurement she seemed interesting to me no one else though but i could see this book speaking to other people who aren't me just not me and no children is a great song","1764":"well i guess i am the kind of person who isn't left with a whole lot of questions when i finish a novel there are characters who's stories don't feel complete and you never really get at the reason behind the big 'incident' that is referred to throughout the book","1765":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i wasn't crazy about the way this book was structured though i liked the author's style and the voice of the character i was never completely clear on the reason for the accident and more importantly why sean no longer seemed to suffer from the delusions that led him to this end i also wasn't clear on the character of chris hayes","1766":"i loved this book very different from other things i have read","1767":"i couldn't finish this book it just got too dull","1768":"thoughts from a young man with a brain injury 50 pages in no plot some chilling moments of stark reality which were my favorites but maybe not enough or not enough to keep me connected to the work not sure","1769":"i really really liked the first 2 3 of this book but for some reason i was not thrilled with things as they were wrapping up so many things were left unanswered throughout that i look back and wonder if i missed a chapter here and there","1770":" i can understand why people might not get this book i went into it skeptical because to be honest a book about gaming didn't really appeal to me however john darnielle creates a world that is at once beautiful and terrible and so real that i couldn't help but be moved by it and like most reviewers i walked away still haunted by the story there are parts of this novel that spoke to me in a genuine and real way that was like nothing i've read before which is something that happens less and less to me as an adult reader i might be a little biased because i've always loved his music however this novel proves that john darnielle knows how to work words in a way that is truly honest and powerful and as always his words meant something to me sure this book is not for everyone but there is no denying its merits","1771":"completely gut wrenching but verbally delightful john proved his talent for words extends beyond lyricism","1772":" sean philips has been disfigured since he's been 17 he's not a little disfigured he's horribly disfigured his face is so mangled that it looks like tire treads his mouth is for malformed that he can't speak understandably and needs to drink through a straw this book jumps back and forth from what life is like for sean now over 15 years later and the time before the accident up to the recovery period right after the narrative is quite successful because as you become more sympathetic to sean you learn more about him including how the incident occurred and the extent of his damages to supplement his income sean created an adventure game where players send in moves kind of like dungeons and dragons this game has created its own problem when players take it for reality and end up in their own tragedy sean doesn't really know why he caused the incident nor is he maudlin about his plight he suffers with the consequences of being lonely and needing to have his dressing changed daily and not being able to have a regular job the story is bleak but it draws you in i identify with sean he's the nerdy kid who enjoys sci fi too much and gets bullied by the cool kids what happens to sean seems senseless but danielle provides an understanding for why something senseless can happen not through volition but inertia","1773":"things i receive in the mail calendars from my realtor glossy stock photos of smiling children from the continent of africa shoes my wife bought me on amazon bank statements and tax forms free glorope samples--you know the normal stuff things i don't receive in the mail poetic invocations of some future apocalyptic world that are posed in the second person for that i rely on john darnielle of indie music fame and his protagonist who operates a rather cool mail based role playing game beyond this imaginative conceit the novel is also notable for its quirky insightful use of hypothetical metaphor its outcast narrator and its potentially exasperating ambiguity i suspect that how you relate to these characteristics will determine whether you think the novel's converging story lines ultimately deliver the goods quotes or if you like cute or snl inspired headings notable quotables i was lost in the story these people all believed catching currents of it and riding them out into the far reaches of imagined possibility believing everything they believed but from different angles exciting perspectives smoldering momentary vistas without end here's an example of one of those hypothetical metaphors i mentioned she started digging through her gigantic purse to try to find something else to play in her purse tape shells clacked against one another while she dug you could hear them scraping against each other against keys against pens and compacts the sounds muffled in the purse's puffy vinyl folds to me it sounded like somebody shaking up dry bones i closed my eyes and thought about those old bones in some girl's purse and then i let my mind go if you wanted to fit bones into your purse they'd have to be broken into pieces you couldn't fit a whole arm bone or a leg bone or a skull in there just teeth toes and fingers maybe kneecaps but my imagination told me teeth would make a high sound like pieces of glass and toes would sound dull like old crushed cans that left fingers i remembered biology class when we did anatomy distal phalanges proximal phalanges metacarpals to walk around with a bag full of bones in the normal world would require a stone constitution you could be a thief you could be an actor probably actors die young in ancient rome though if it's the present day and you're kimmy and you're carrying someone's bones around in your purse then i have a lot of questions for you and i'll probably never ask them and you'll have a secret that only i have guessed i once published a paragraph about memory dinosaurs and the beatles in an alzheimer's newsletter this seems just as true as whatever i wrote there i once heard in a science class that you don't start remembering things until you're three or maybe five when i remember this day and most things before it it's like trying to remember being four years old or two i can see it and i know it happened and i have enough information about it to reconstruct the whole scene to my own satisfaction but the person to whom it happened is somewhere so far off that i only know it's me because i can see his face and because i'm the one remembering","1774":"there was some interesting writing in this book and i wrote down a few quotes i liked however i didn't like any of the characters and i wasn't interested in sean's accident enough to be truly invested in the story i really looked forward to reading this book and i ended up disappointed","1775":" there are a lot of authors out there john darnielle is a writer and you would be hard pressed to find a writer who can craft a story any better than he does with wolf in white van i would be remiss if i didn't add that it's what some folks might consider a little weird it is clearly not going to appeal to everyone but to me it was pure art i loved it i was fortunate enough to get an advance copy of this book it is absolutely amazing and tragic and inspiring and mysterious and and and well now i'm just gushing","1776":"this is pretty special the writing is a beautiful portrait of the agony of adolescence of feeling everything more and understanding it less it has a kind of dream like elegiac quality to it serving to perfectly capture the unreliability of memory as well as to mourn the possibilities of the life our character lost in one pivotal moment really sad but very beautiful","1777":" i read this book after hearing the author interviewed on npr fresh air it was a wonderful interview which made me like the author and i wanted to like this book more than i did i found the narrative structure confusing at the beginning too much was held back early on and the long descriptions of trace italian moves felt a little like filler or an incomplete concept not fully fleshed out doing little to advance the story as the book progressed the moves felt more entwined with the narrator but early on there was too much held back for the game moves to feel significant and i found it to be as boring as watching strangers play a board game the prose however was wonderful and i enjoyed the wistful nostalgia mixed with resigned melancholy","1778":"this feels like a first book i think john will write better novels somewhat confusing and choppy for no real reason i feel like i might give it a higher rating if i re read it i felt real compassion with sean","1779":"i read this book in two days a must for anyone who finds themselves escaping into other realities to deal with things writers readers musicians gamers probably everyone so good","1780":"sean's life is outlined in first person he describes experiences from his past u0026amp his present comments or activities trigger memories for him to relay to the reader as he brings the reader up to speed on what happened in the past sean usually finds a link back to the present sean references a game similar to dungeons u0026amp dragons sean's game is called trace italian i never played dungeons u0026amp dragons sean makes the concept clear u0026amp why it is important to the players i could empathize with their interest sean's life wasn't just about gaming he had his fair share of tragedy we all have to decide how to cope how to grow i heard great acclaim for this book u0026amp was excited to start it i was very interested from a medical standpoint if i was a gamer i might have felt more of a thrill i liked wolf in white van but it wasn't the thrilling tale initially recommended to me","1781":"gobbled up every word as though i had been hungry for this story","1782":"underwhelming i'm afraid i think due to poor structure and form gets better in second half but it seemed an obvious way to keep reader's interest also the thoughtful moments of insight of protag didn't feel congruent made me sad cos i loved the sabbath novella and his band forever '","1783":"once i got into the book the writing really carried me through the somewhat depressing parts when i stopped trying to figure out how the details of the game related to sean's state of mind i found it much easier to engage stick with it and you won't be disappointed the ending keeps you thinking for a while the reason i didn't give it more stars is that it was somewhat convoluted and confusing to me and i struggled a bit to get into the flow of the story","1784":" the concept behind this book is wonderfully clever the reader gets the narrator's story in the order of present to past an order that slowly reveals his inner darkness this concept works in tandem with the reference in the title supposedly innocent songs can be played in reverse to get the satanic messages such as wolf in white van one reviewer wrote that this is a book about how being an adolescent feels and i agree that this is well portrayed it depicts how powerfully the imagination can take hold and set you on paths that feel like choices but really are inevitable after the first few turnings and that all lead to the same place eventually but beyond this interesting abstract portrayal in the end i wanted a book that was a little more obvious about what it was about this book left me unsettled unsatisfied and not a little lost that's more a review of me than the book no doubt but there it is","1785":"this book just didn't do it for me i definitely think audio was the wrong format to read this in there's a lot going on and i know i missed a lot from listening rather than reading in print it's read by the author who despite being a great singer was a lackluster reader his monotone often lulled me into sleepiness and i kept having to rewind and listen to passages again the backwards chronology did manage to hook me at the beginning the narrator sean disfigured after a mysterious accident at age 17 runs an rpg type game through the mail we learn that he is being sued after 2 players try to act out the game in real life and end up freezing to death the narrative moves backwards slowly revealing what actually happened to sean on the day of his accident and how it relates to his current situation while i was intrigued by the premise the ending didn't feel satisfying","1786":"i could make it easier for him if i tried hard enough it isn't really much of a mystery this occasional need i have to comfort my father i did something terrible to his son once a beautifully written first novel lyrical and sometimes dream like as the adult survivor of a teenaged suicide attempt grapples with his new existence the story comes in bits and pieces and the obvious is shunned in favour of the complex and sometimes the unexplainable this is not a book with an easy moral at the end this is not a book that doles out hope or platitudes like candy your thoughts on why the protagonist did what he did when he was 17 will inevitably shift as you finally learn the facts","1787":" a darker contemporary version of the catcher in the rye complete with enigmatic title which is explained to the extent anything in this narrative is explained i found it a downer especially in light of my observations of some of the teen and twenty something generation of today it's a good debut novel it's just not going to be everyone's cup of tea i wavered between a 3 and 4 rating the sequence in catcher is linear except to the extent that the narrator brings up memories of the past wolf is neither stream of consciousness nor linear narrative it's a relating of events that have occurred over a few years told in a not altogether coherent fashion by the narrator the whole book is an interior monologue told by a 20 something designer of a role playing game and it focuses on two traumatic events whose common thread is the sense of alienation and isolation felt by the narrator and by some of the kindred spirits to whom his game appeals i dislike spoilers and try not to put them into a review let me just issue this warning to prospective readers you won't come away with a wrap up that answers all your questions you'll come up with the same level of understanding that the narrator has about the key events and the motivations behind them basically that the whys are unknowable that what happened was one of a set of infinite possibilities for his life you keep wanting him to explain himself and he keeps trying to tell you that he can't explain not to you not even to himself i'm writing this review shortly after finishing the book and i don't feel that i've even gotten started digesting it i'll probably have to reread it but don't want to put myself through that immediately it may be the thickest heaviest 200 page book i've ever read the fact that i feel the need to think about it at length is a sign that it's a work of literature i may find myself raising the rating and adding to the review at a later time","1788":" okay i don't know exactly what to say about this but i think maybe there are some things i should say something it is a pretty good book when i finished it i wanted there to be more and maybe that's because the ending wasn't satisfying but the ending was a beginning so maybe it's not supposed to be a theme that runs throughout the book is how sean has these feelings that he is unable to communicate to other people that they couldn't possibly understand and i related to that a lot i think maybe that includes the reader as well though there were a lot of times where it felt like it was circling around an idea that it couldn't quite state and i think that's where sean or at least darnielle is trying to give us something that he can't really communicate i had a terrible thought which i am ashamed to have had and which i will probably never be able to bring myself to write down what was it though i think i am supposed to understand but i'm not sure i do i liked that though i think darnielle understands that that's what stories are for i will try harder the title of the book refers to supposed satanic messages hidden in rock songs by backmasking and the story is reverse chronological so there's an obvious connection there it even uses the words trace back or back trace a few times he's trying to trace back to the source of something that hurt him the less obvious connection is that everybody in the book is very concerned about hidden or subliminal messages but it is the overt messages that end up hurting people especially when they misinterpret them sean and conan the barbarian ray's respect guns speech sean's parents and his relationship with kimmy lance and carrie with trace italian lance and carrie's part of the story really got to me i don't know why i just can't stop picturing the two of them curled up together holding each other in that low dirt pit in kansas with the wind roaring overhead i guess that's a spoiler i'm sorry i wish the author had spent more time on that part of the story i wanted to know them more and know sean's feelings about them more it's a very short book overall as well just about 200 pages that's not necessarily a flaw but i felt like sometimes it needed more space to work out some things i'd never heard any of the author's music before so this was the first experience i had of him and i was struck by all the little pieces of people i knew who were fans of his that i could see staring out at me my friend owen whose mom tore him apart in ways he's still learning to undo and who loves the mountain goats more than anyone i've ever met john green who placed them as four of his top five bands just above his brother and whose narrative style evokes so many comparisons tessa who i loved more than anything in the world i almost cried when sean struggled to pronounce an r sound i don't know i will probably be thinking about this book for a little while i have been rereading little parts of it as i remember things that became more relevant later you should probably read it","1789":"this was beautifully written it's by john darnielle of mountain goats fame of course it is and the way he weaves the narrative is unique and i sort of love that we don't exactly know what happened until the very last page even though you know at least i did throughout all 200 pages but it is just so damn sad and so depressing god","1790":"what the what this book was odd i did actually enjoy it for the most part while i was reading it i liked the format of the story being told backwards i really liked learning about the game sean created however i did not find the ending to be satisfying and i'm left with the overall feeling of what was that","1791":"do not understand the hype","1792":"i applaud any first time novelist who can create such an interesting premise and character but i struggled to connect to this story","1793":"as we help teach the poor house bachelors how to think for themselves and respond critically to life art theology politics social justice etc we have introduced them to a lot of indie music one of the songs in high rotation within the poor house is \"the legend of chavo guerrero\" by the mountain goats the songwriter and lead singer and all around mastermind of the mountain goats is john darnielle for whom i have personally sent a letter to the white house encouraging president obama to name as poet laureate of these great united states i believe that john darnielle is the finest lyricist currently working in pop music nearly on par with the best of bob dylan van morrison and other singer songwriters of that caliber for example the goats' latest opus is a concept album called \"beat the champ \" all the songs on which are about professional wrestling but the album is also about so much more our future dream poet laureate has made a compelling argument for the idea that professional wrestling life on his wonderful song \"chavo guerrero \" mr darnielle sings that chavo guerrero was the heroic father figure that he otherwise never would have had in interviews mr darnielle has openly discussed his father's physical emotional and mental abuse so these lyrics are incredibly gripping \"...i need justice in my life here it comeslook highit's my last hopechavo guerrerocoming off the top ropehe was my hero back when i was a kidyou let me down but chavo never once didyou called him names to try to get beneath my skinnow your ashes are scattered on the windi heard his son got famous he went nationwidecoast to coast with his dad by his sidei don't know if that's true but i've been toldit's real sweet to grow old\"ouch set to a chunky sticky clever guitar riff this is \"chicken skin music\" for this father of three that is a long preface to discussing john's first book wolf in white van which was a finalist for the national book award this year i believe the setting is brilliant surprisingly well realized and succinctly stated i've read other novels by other songwriters and frankly they're pretty painful and pitiful but john nails it here his protagonist is a mutilated young man who orchestrates a number of dungeons and dragons like role playing games for enthusiasts all over the world his daily life is a mixture of administrative duties associated with the role playing games quick insights into his customers players sad impersonal interractions with people and places in his neighborhood and near continuous reflections on his childhood and the events that led up to his self mutilation the book is wonderfully written and his ability to turn a phrase in song shows up innumerable times within his novel but it's hard to read because it's so darn depressing the book is a little emotionally overwhelming what works powerfully in a three minute pop song can drag you into the abyss when you're reading a three hundred page book it took me far longer than typical to read a book of this length i read it in ~20 page chunks to soften its effect three stars and i hope he keeps writing","1794":"i've never read anything like this the author has an extremely vivid way of describing ideas concepts and feelings it's not a book i could understand well quickly skimming through i found that if i took time to absorb what the author was saying the effect was very profound like a good piece of art it wasn't immediately gripping but after i understood the point of the book and became accustomed to the voice of the style i started to relate and became engaged","1795":"interesting and thought provoking novel by mountain goats frontman john darnielle the description makes it seem like it's a heavier ready player one but that couldn't be farther from the truth it's a novel about choices mistakes reasoning and the nature of solitude","1796":"i wanted to love this book but it never really hooked me i love the mountain goats and every time i hear john darnielle speak i want to hear more sadly though the words were lovely the narrative never got off the ground for me i would recommend this book to my male friends who grew up loners and misfits i think it might fill a niche for them that i just can't relate to","1797":"amazing a meditation on regret couched in the mythos of dungeons and dragons and conan the barbarian i would have liked to know more about the trace italian and lance and carrie but sean's story was compelling and it will haunt me for a good long time","1798":"the most irritating part of reading media reviews on social sites is the tendency for people to write long dispatches on their personal experiences and how those experiences alter their reception of a work the question of how people relate to art is central to this book however and i feel like i've moved past the time in my life where it would have moved me darnielle captures perfectly the loneliness that most young people go through and the way they retreat into hobbies or art to escape that feeling of being misunderstood he uses a metaphor that involved astronomers and unknown planets that i kind of wish i had written down and i can definitely relate to that but i know now that no one cares about my bullshit except me and i just don't feel those emotions as strongly anymore","1799":"i really liked the writing in this short novel but i was in the wrong frame of mind to connect with the narrator sean is the creator of a fantasy role playing game you participate in via postal mail and a bit of a recluse due to a disfiguring accident he suffered as a teen his story is slowly revealed through flashbacks memories and testimony","1800":"i heard that someone definitely not me pirated an electronic version of this beautifully melancholy thing blew through it in a day and liked it so much she immediately went out and bought it in hardcover","1801":"fun little meditation on a host of 1980's heartland boogeymen role playing games scifi fantasy trash lit televangelists vans video arcades suicide pacts and heavy metal well worth the time","1802":"this was a very different book i found it to be quite quirky and unique it was well written even though t could get a little frustrating i got used to the flow of the story moving from past to present i thought john darnielle told a great story and i really liked sean's character this novel won't be for everyone but it's a quick read if you're willing to give it a try","1803":"while it was certainly well written and had an interesting structure it was too dark and at times elliptical for my taste","1804":"this is one of those books that i kept thinking about even when i wasn't reading it i'd be interested to re read it in reverse and see if the tone of the story changes","1805":"a rather scattered read there's a lot of interesting stuff and the voice is certainly reminiscent of darnielle's songwriting but i feel like i never really understood what the book wanted to say the little stories that comprise the book are decent but they don't serve a central thread that i can detect perhaps that's the meditation of the book that life is just a series of moves that move you forward to some other point i don't know i have ideas of themes that can be taken from the book but nothing i'd say was solidly the point of the book","1806":" i didn't enter this into goodreads immediately because i wanted to read it again first i still haven't done that and may update this when i do but suffice it to say it was a novel that left me spellbound by its language impressed by its structure and feeling frustrated while also feeling that maybe this is a book i'm supposed to be frustrated by each time i ask a question of it that tries to get at my feelings of dissatisfaction it leads me to think of my own assumptions and what i really want from novels do i need a plot no do i need characters to hug and learn and grow no do i need to have a clear answer for everything no and in fact that would probably be a mark against any novel worth its salt so why am i intermittently so frustrated that this novel doesn't have any of these things i think in the end it's significant that the story revolves around a game that is like a giant maze out of which you can never escape never find the edges the central character is like that too and while i don't generally have much patience for existentialist protagonists designed to throw their own infinite unknowability in the reader's face but sean phillips was at least interesting and entertaining in the time i spent with him","1807":"i am a mountain goats fan and have been for years because of that i know that john darnielle is an excellent storyteller and his writing is usually on the edge of the angst ridden cynical and biting his lyrics are evocative of suburban boredom and less than fulfilling relationships that are always on the edge of ending but don't this book has a similar feel to it and i can't completely wrap my head around it sean is an outcast because of an accident that leaves him severely disfigured he struggles to go out in public due to the staring and discomfort of those around him his parents are angry about the whole thing and he is left without any real friends most stopped coming around after not knowing how to deal with his injuries to keep himself busy while still having contact with the outside world he constructs an elaborate fantasy world where participants can pay to take turns within the game through the mail he becomes interested in the lives of several of his participants but is never really involved in their lives outside of the game unfortunately some people end up taking the game too seriously i don't really know what to think of this book as i just finished it last night and i'm still mulling it over in my mind sean is a deeply sympathetic character yet we don't get to know him that well his motivations aren't completely clear but as a narrator he is thoughtful and complex his story comes out in pieces i still feel his loneliness","1808":"still trying to digest this so poetically written but so disturbing beneath the surface i might have to read it a second time but i'm pretty sure i'm not going to like what i see update ok so i read this a second time and i knocked off one star from my rating because i kind of get it now that life is like a choose your own adventure game with infinite choices you can make at each step and we will never know why the narrator chooses that one decision over every other but he did his heart is unknowable because life is unknowable the game is unsolvable and so is the book i guess i just find that less satisfying than actually knowing you spend a whole book getting to know a guy and then right at the end he leaves you hanging that's just kind of cold man","1809":"really well written there is not one sentence that you would want to skim through heavy subject matter","1810":"i have a lot of trouble with books that don't seem to go anywhere or have a point it's one of the reasons i don't read as much adult fiction as i used to they're often full of self indulgent adult characters who don't really learn anything about themselves or about the world or go through any kind of plot over the course of the novel this is not an over arching judgment on novels published for adults i have read tons of magnificent novels for adults over the years it's just a statement of something that can happen in adult fiction but rarely happens in teen fiction anyway this book was very interesting and i loved the parts of it that were dedicated to thoughts about consequences of the mail in role play game seriously loved that but i couldn't help feeling throughout the book that i was going come away from it with some wildly exciting ideas or perspectives or emotions and it just never quite delivered i felt like the entire book was a set up for something but then it was just done great writing though and fascinating scenarios and characters no complaints about that at all i just wanted more story i guess alex award winner so could be a good rec for teens notes set in 90's attempted suicide suicide pact that resulted in death and permanent damage drugs drinking smoking","1811":"this one is one of the few books i might read again generally i don't reread books too many new ones await i found it sad and beautiful and strangely insightful i really loved the gaming metaphor throughout that idea of paths and journeys and nobody ever winning i'm still chewing on some of the images from this book marveling at how deeply darnielle occupies sean's isolated lonely yet strangely noble perspective","1812":"for the most part i got all i wanted out of wolf in white van i was reading it because i am a huge fan of the mountain goats specifically the song writing the novel is written beautifully and the structure is both innovative and powerful to the storytelling but ultimately i was more interested in the events that happened in between that are still hazy and i could have used more basically i wish this book was longer that's why it did not get the last star","1813":" one description i read is that the story is told in reverse order which really does seem true but i felt the ending beginning was rather abrupt i turned the page on my kindle and suddenly got the see more by this author message was not expecting the literal end of the book when it came as for the story itself well it felt like the story on the page was not the story i was there to read i wanted to read about his accident and the rpg he created and the reasons for the trial but those seemed to be peripheral to a story about well just him living that's not a good way to describe it but not coming up with anything better","1814":"absolutely breathtaking john darnielle takes the reader through a beautiful dark and surprising journey through a man's ever moving mind through pain sorrow delight and even peace this book will leave its reader in silence as you end the book wrapped in the journey who have just taken","1815":"lit fic for geeks","1816":"a world seeming as rich as trace italian but as in trace italian you can't see all of it but you know there is more","1817":"this gave me a lot to mull over and is fantastically written","1818":"i really wanted this to be great and it is great in some places and of course lyrically written sometimes the metaphors within metaphors were a bit much for me though and the plot didn't really come together for me at the end i guess the ending was a twist but i was like okay that was good but everyone says this is great gonna read his novella for 33 1 3 next and see if maybe his fiction works better in a smaller form","1819":"utterly engrossing poignant and harrowing and so acute about both the solace an escape into fantasy can offer and the dangers of renouncing life for a chimera","1820":" a hell of a debut novel told from the perspective of an isolated disfigured man who runs a play by mail adventure game the book follows episodes from his life including traumas and mundane details from his past darnielle's writing style means that even the smallest details of a memory or a mental process are rendered in vivid livable detail i especially adored the way he describes the psychology of creating imaginary worlds and of guiding people through them there are parts that are silly and parts that are poignant and very moving i can see why it was on so many best of lists when it came out","1821":"if this is your thing it's really going to be your thing it was not my thing i would have rated it lower but it's really really well written and it seemed unfair to lump it in with crappy books just because i didn't like it","1822":"really well written i want to write enjoyable but the subject matter isn't particularly perhaps it's more accurate to say imaginative compelling and fascinating","1823":"read this book if ... your body is ready wiwv is a crazy ride short as it is read it also if you're already a fan of the mountain goats the novel reads as if darnielle expounded on one of his angsty death ditties-short chapters feel like verses and the rhythmic prose moves the story along to a steady beat make sure you listen to \"the sunset tree\" on repeat while you read don't read this book if ... disjointed narratives bother you this plot doesn't move linearly and it may take some careful reading to follow along a casual reader may still find it entertaining and darnielle's voice is captivating whether you know what he's talking about or not but wiwv requires a good deal of attention to keep pace with the experimental story structure and keep track of the heavy symbolism this books is like ... the dark scary version of ernest cline's ready player one in which a virtual reality game is substituted for a written one and the whole story is told from the perspective of players instead of the creator on the level of narratives wiwv reminds me of arundhati roy's god of small things and on a lesser scale of don delillo's the body artist or maybe mao ii but without the over the top self adoring postmodern mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo that i deeply love so don't get me wrong see my full review here http litbeetle com 2014 10 14 on jo","1824":"john darnielle better at novels than michael jordan was at baseball for an early foray in the medium wolf in white van is respectably short and sweet steady and unhurried it passes over the concentrated drama of darnielle's songwriting for a narrative style well aligned to his narrator's person this parity allows the story to grow backwards at its own mature pace thanks for keeping your tale true to its teller john keep on swinging i'm excited to see where your work on the page takes you","1825":"i did finish it but quite a few times i considered quitting only the fact that it was on the short side gave me motivation to continue first off the blurb is very misleading i was under the impression i would be reading something scifi on the order of ready player one nope not even close secondly the whole story is basically inside one characters head i'm a reader who doesn't enjoy stories that are heavy on introspection especially when the character has too much self over analyzing of every thought and feeling it gets really boring really quick three what exactly was the point to all of this there really was no plot line just a story told in reverse about a man who shot his face off when he was a kid and created a dungeons and dragons type game called trace italian played by snail mail we are told about a couple of teens who took the game to seriously and caused themselves harm the parents tried to bring a lawsuit against sean the creator and it was dropped as almost as quickly as it was brought up just a dead end that went no where more and more pages of inner thoughts i have little patience for this stream of consciousness style of writing then we finally get to the moment of the shooting and that doesn't make any sense either there just wasn't any justification in it he gave no real reason for it just glad it's over","1826":" this book was really fantastic and i think the audiobook read by the author is really the way to go incredibly thought provoking book about the nature of impulse whether self concept identity is continuous over time what it's like to resist learning lessons from the things that happen in our lives and what parts of our lives one can even construct narrative from with some satanic panic thrown in which i always love word to the wise if you do read the audiobook the first couple of chapters are a bit opaque but it opens up after that and gets really compelling relatively quickly i read this as i imagine a lot of people did because i love the mountain goats i really hope john darnielle writes more books","1827":" short review impressively complex narrative that quietly lingers with you days after finishing it deftly explores the communication between parents and teenagers the cultural proclivities of a generation human interaction in general and consequences even while revealing the final scene in increments as the book paces chronologically backwards you're still left with a final harrowing surprise there are a couple of scenes that felt redundant unnecessary some niche cultural references can be isolating but the author overall does a great job with keeping the cultural content consistent but accessible long review i changed my rating about five or six times i couldn't tell immediately if i loved it or was ambivalent although overall complex with a fluid writing style which is how i like my contemporary fiction the last chapter is chaotic broken down jarring which is why i needed some time to let the ending marinate since this is a book that essentially reads backwards at least chronologically it definitely requires a second read through to fully understand and appreciate the events as they unfold and the character's state of mind once you have the full story you see the main character sean essentially in his day to day life which seems a bit mundane on the surface but is actually unique he is the designer of a mail in choose your own adventure game about a future dystopian world requiring the players to seek the elusive trace italian a haven located in present day kansas he has also suffered physical injuries from some unknown unnamed accident that occurred decades ago not to be confused with the present day incident in which he is currently legally entangled i have to say i'm a huge fan of narratives that play around chronologically with the timeline though i do prefer the linear reverse timeline simply because most authors mess up and confuse multiple timelines even though you essentially find out the major details of the accident the author leaves a juicy and surprising detail in the final pages i think my jaw literally dropped though if you read a little more carefully you might be able to see the hints that the author drops hindsight bias anyone besides the superbly crafted chronology interspersed within the narrative are excerpts from sean's game and correspondence from players in the game you can see the predecessor to online chat rooms and correspondence through these brief letters and the unique connection established between sean and his players with most of the players voluntarily revealing details of their personal life or unintentionally displaying personal characteristics even nowadays there is still some skepticism about how true a connection or relationship one can establish with someone one never sees but as with sean's relationship with the player chris haynes online or in this case mail in relationships can be just as true and genuine if different sean's relationship with his parents was also interesting for the most part they are portrayed as normal suburban parents torn between horror and parental protection having to face an extremely difficult event you see the gaps in understanding between them sean also sees them and acknowledges the fact that he should bridge that gap in communication but tends to let those moments drift by unresolved resulting in more tension and anger you see flashes of the stereotypically uncommunicative teenager but you also see the immense effort he goes through on occasion to tamp down his anger and teenage surliness to be polite or decent all in all you can't help liking sean he's not particularly effusive or personable but he seems to be a decent human being darnielle also utilizes a lot of niche specific cultural references as someone who was born just after this cultural phenomena became redundant i had a little trouble fully getting into sean's headspace sure i could parallel my tastes and proclivities with his and connect that way but it was still a bit of a turn off to have to either stop and look up an unknown band or series or continue on blithely still he does not over emphasize sean's tastes which i definitely appreciated and for the most part explained some of the more obscure references without being condescending or irritating overall a worthwhile read","1828":"it's full of all the things you tried to forget about growing up","1829":"i listened to this narrated by john darnielle himself over the course of about a day this is a richly complex novel utterly heartbreaking and devastating in a very quiet and gentle way sean was the kind of character that feels too real i'm going to think of him often and i know even when i know better that i'm going to wonder if he's ok darnielle has created something beautiful and sad and real","1830":"note to self re read when you have a couple long chunks of time to dedicate to this not a book to be read in a dozen shorter sessions","1831":" wolf in white van is a story about how there are no stories to make sense of the world and human action the narrative is told in the first person in reverse and through memory while the central claim is that there are no grand stories to make sense of why people do the things that they do at a reading darnielle put it simply chaos reigns the story unfolds primarily through memory memory is at a foundational level the creation of narrative out of available pieces of data which means that wolf is white van is something of an argument against itself they may not be what we wish they were but in the end there are stories for why things happen they way they do these stories may not exist 'out there ' but we create them they are ours and for whatever reason and toward whatever ends we share them with others","1832":"parts were interesting but the uninteresting outweighed the interesting for me another book list disappointment","1833":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the book had an unsatisfactory ending for me no answers i wanted to understand why he shot himself i guess it really was an accident but there was so much stuff going on in this guys head between the game he created and the lawsuit he was involved in and i just wanted to know 1 why was he disfigured and 2 how did it happen will be interested to hear what others think","1834":"this book is beautiful and heart wrenching please read it if you can","1835":"it's very rare to come across someone who has a voice i find incredibly unique but john darnielle is definitely one of them i had always been a fan of music the ability he has to create impactful narratives in short 3 5 minute songs then i picked up his entry into the 33 1 3 series of books master of reality and was deeply impressed at his skill in creating something outside what i considered his comfort zone of songwriting i don't think john really has a comfort zone he seems adept at crafting stories in whatever medium he feels the voice and humanity he gives to sean as a character is immersive the book is almost hypnotic in the way darnielle flows through passages his way of transforming everything mundane or simple into meaningful images is uncanny he manages to make a full page description about looking at a ceiling fascinating i'd almost compare him to someone like raymond carver not necessarily as succinct as him but he shares the ability to infuse the boring trappings of everyday life with a kind of magic to go into the plot of the book would be pointless this isn't really about plot not really wolf in white van is a deep analysis of many many things which i'll avoid delving too deep into at the risk of sounding pretentious it's incredibly moving and impossibly sad and joyful at the same time i have an urge to read through it all over again but at the same time want to treasure the experience worried that repeated visits will cheapen the sentiment","1836":"#six the open path at the overpass gives way to grand schemes huge multipart responses whole narratives from within the canvas newly forming inside the player's imagination i keep myself out of it i interpret and react like a flowchart responding flatly to a person who's asking it how to live magnificent and confounding","1837":"as a longtime fan of the mountain goats and darnielle's abilities as a lyricist i was very eager to read this novel it was not what i expected where tmg lyrics are often very poetic and somewhat exaggerated in emotional affect this book works by adopting a very quiet measured tone while addressing some seriously dark subject matter i think that inversion of tone is what makes it work so well along with the reversal of chronology alluded to in the title in the book wolf in white van is a phrase heard by playing a rock record in reverse the book ends on the pivotal moment of the narrator's life but we have already spent 200 pages exploring the emotional and physical fallout of that moment there's no mystery to solve on one level as we already have all the facts we need on another there is no answer to the motivation that caused sean to act that day and perhaps darnielle's point is that there cannot be any real answer while the book functions as a tape running in reverse and there is no escape from the horrors that befall basically everyone involved it also presents a psychological view of pure joy in the midst of unreasoning pain several scenes are emotionally devastating but are presented from a perspective of equanimity and cool remove i really found the contrast in tones and perspectives interesting and i think the author did a wonderful job sketching a narrative voice that is basically unknowable even to itself the writing is not flashy and the metaphors and lyricism is pared way back i found the style to be very solid self assured and perfectly suited to the theme of the book it's sort of a placid prosaic surface where flashes of heartbreak are faintly visible underneath i'm not sure all of the elements of the plot fully gelled as i would have loved to hear more about trace italian and its players but i think that's not the point a very interesting read that i'm still processing","1838":"i'm not sure why but i just didn't enjoy this book that much it was ok which is why it got 2 stars luckily it was a quick read so i didn't have to spend that much time on it","1839":"if master of reality was a novelization of the best ever death metal band in denton then wolf in white van is a novelization of toolshed and ain't nothin' wrong with toolshed","1840":"amazing as soon as i finished i wanted to start over again plenty to think about in this book","1841":" two things i enjoyed the narrative structure and the idea of trace italian i liked that the narrative was told outside the traditional chronological order most stories tend to follow it seemed suited to the psyche of the narrator i also enjoyed reading the game segments involving trace italian even if the concept of a mail in role playing game is a little stupid if those are a thing and i'm sure it's a very niche thing should that be the case then i don't know people sure can be impractical the prose itself was what i found to be the biggest issue it's overwrought and self indulgent i thought roth had a bad tendency of getting side tracked at least in american pastoral but this guy the narrator spends so much time waxing poetic on hospital ceilings and the like to the point where i don't know it's just too much there wasn't anything about the narrator that gave me cause to care about anything he had to say the book is relatively short as it is so it makes me wonder just how lean it could have been had the superfluous crap been trimmed i seem to be in the minority in regards to the praise heaped on this book it makes me wonder about the state of popular literature if this book with all its contrived philosophical musings is so widely regarded i haven't listened to much of the mountain goats but the book jacket would have me believe this fellow is one of the best songwriters of his generation if that is indeed the case perhaps he should stick to the making of music read as part of a 2015 book challenge a book a friend recommended","1842":" wolf in white van is weird and claustrophobic and alternately beautiful and bleak its narrator sean phillips is the creator of trace italian a text based game played through the mail sean doesn't go out much he suffered a disfiguring injury when he was seventeen in which he almost died but didn't and his reconstructed face twentyish years afterwards is still a wreck he doesn't really get out of his head and neither does the narrative he ruminates on choices and the lack of them reasons and the lack of them the branching paths that make up a life things done things undone paths and doors closed off by how things went the game trace italian is like that too a player reads a scenario and makes a move and that move takes the player in a particular direction opening particular options and removing others so right there's sean and his life and there's the game and there are carrie and lance two high school kids playing trace italian who decide to take their play into the actual world there's a lot in this book about the life of the imagination and the inner life generally the things in our heads the things that stay there and don't get expressed the things that do get expressed that maybe shouldn't have or that maybe should have been expressed in some different way sean talks about his childhood fantasies about backyard conan thrown together from half understood comic books only i ruled a smoking wrecked kingdom with a hard and deadly hand it was dark and gory no one liked living there not even its king it had a soundtrack all screams 7 i liked the first half of this book a lot especially some of the passages that are introductions to the story and mechanics and origins of trace italian the way it plays and the way that sean relates to the players and some of the passages about sean reflecting on incidents from his childhood like this i sift and rake and dig around in my vivid recollections of young sean on the floor in the summer and i try to see what makes him tick but i know a secret about young sean i guess that he kind of ends up telling the world nothing makes him tick it just happens all by itself tick tick tick tick tick without any proximal cause with nothing underneath it 107 but the second half of the book fell sort of flat for me and i'm not sure why the story is told mostly in reverse with other digressions into memory and maybe that's part of it you know the story is working its way toward the full story of sean's injury and maybe i didn't want to read that story maybe too it's that i wanted more of other people more of lance and carrie who aren't in the book's second half maybe i was just more interested in sean's present more recent past everything after the defining event than i was in the defining event or the lead up to it","1843":"a beautifully told story about the choices of teenagers a deleuzian mail in role playing game and the lives we carve out for ourselves amidst the rubble","1844":"less of a story than i might have liked strange for me i usually shun plot ick but some intense vignettes and meditations","1845":"while extremely loose plot wise and the characters somewhat insubstantial this novel is clever and the language beautiful i would give a higher rating if some of the key ideas were properly fleshed out however it's a short novel and well worth the short amount of time it takes to read through it","1846":"read my review at http www vhcle com wolf_in_white_va","1847":"it's very rare i enjoy a story that starts at the end and works it's way back i'm not sure if i would have liked this more if it was told in chronological order though i guess my biggest complaint is that the story feels unfinished","1848":" while i'm not sure i understood everything the author wanted me to take away from this book i couldn't help but be kind of hypnotized by its tone and voice the circular motion of its story my favorite parts about this book are of course those that touch on imagine worlds and how and why those can become more real for us than reality i love the idea of trace italian the game and why someone might invent such a place and what kind of people might play in it what kind of people might get lost in it i was intrigued by the effect of the conan stories on the young narrator and their effect on his accident but i'm not sure i fully understand the climax of the book when we finally learned what happened that night or rather why it really is a well written thinky book that i will now proceed to think more about","1849":"a great story about escapism and how it competes with the banality of everyday life the book centers around a play by mail rpg run by sean as it walks back through his life sean having maimed himself as a teenager watches bound by his own rules not to interfere as his players walk through his game and as some of them begin to find themselves endangered by the same obsessions that had plagued him","1850":"i admit i didn't know what was going on in this book","1851":"sorry jd the baby is growing molars and doesn't take naps and all i can read right now is ebooks by nora roberts i will try again and hopefully do better luv u jd","1852":"sean made me think of assface from preacher ennis dillon","1853":"haunting beautiful and consuming perfectly captures the growing pains of the introvert and outsider","1854":"sean is a young game designer who has created a strategy game called trace italian he lives in isolation because of a horrible facial disfigurement we begin the novel in court where he is being sued by the parents of a young girl who died in the desert with her male friend while playing his game as if it were real the novel then goes back in time until we relive the events leading up to the time of sean's disfigurement","1855":"when i started reading this i was skeptical i was confused though that seems to be a common thread from the other reviews i have read i do wish there had been a bit more clarity and explanation in the final pages it felt rushed and still somewhat confused you will want to take the time though to go back and re read portions once you turn the final pages","1856":"amazing novel i loved the voice and it was truly hard to read some of the more personal scars he showed and i mean that in a good way working the story backwards wasn't just a clever gimmick i think it really added to the character's onion being peeled","1857":"4 5 out of 5 starsthis tiny little book really packed a major punch i wanted to savor every last word simply because the writing was stunning it was about grief and loneliness and the importance of each choice we make it sounds a bit silly but it was honestly staggering to think about the infinite amount of decisions we act upon every day and how each decision maps the course for the rest of our lives the ending was absolutely phenomenal and i look forward to re reading this one in the future i want to absorb as much as i can from this story","1858":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i felt one of those urges i always got when i was younger and that i still get sometimes to just say something for the explicit purpose of blasting a hole through the conversation we're all witnesses except me i'm an unaligned cleric","1859":"really enjoyed it 4 5 good insight into teenage isolation decisions got me back into dungeons and dragons","1860":"this book feels like an open wound rubbed red raw by the hours i spent reading it and then again by the hours i've spent since then thinking about it it has the sickening pull of a wound too a need to look and when looking stops being satisfactory to push to probe to run fingers over the edges of broken skin and feel before it fades the stomach dropping burn of too much too sensitive too close","1861":" 4 5 stars this little book packs quite a punch it's not just beautifully written it's lyrically written fitting considering john darnielle basically is the mountain goats it's an exploration of the dangers of escapism and the worlds we build for ourselves wolf in white van left me quite unsettled after turning the last page which is perhaps why i held back that last half star it brought to mind the tv show the night of not in content but in tone like hbo's new hit there is no denying it's masterfully crafted the night of's bleakness kept me from truly enjoying it and wolf in white van's general sense of unease kept me always on edge not a book to relax with but worth reading all the same","1862":"i can't rate this yet it took me a couple tries to really start it and it may take me another couple tries to be able to nail down what i think of it or be able to really talk about it the cover design is well chosen the book is structured like a labyrinth where the reader gets lost in the mind and memories of the narrator i don't know how well all the pieces came together ultimately but i'm glad i read it updated the following day i get it now perhaps not surprisingly it was listening to the mountain goats that helped this click for me i was trying to understand the book on an intellectual level and not quite grasping the connections between sean and chris haynes and lance and carrie seeing that they were there but not really getting it if you will and then i was cleaning up my kitchen and put some music on and a mountain goats song came up in the playlist it was lakeside view apartments suite off transcendental youth for the record and something clarified for me the book made sense to me on an emotional level it resists rational interpretation to some degree because sean is not a rational person the links are there because sean feels them to be there it's a beautiful work actually and like darnielle's music it explores the territory of self destruction and the uses and misuses of fantasy as a means of dealing with emotional pain i'm a professional bookseller and received a free copy from the publisher for work","1863":"i can't stop thinking about this book after reading it on a train this weekend","1864":"wolf in white van by john darnielle is well a book that i'm still trying to wrap my head around still trying to understand i think it's a good thing it's staying with me long after i finished the last sentence the writing was pretty simple to me but i did enjoy the structure of the whole book that was interesting the plot

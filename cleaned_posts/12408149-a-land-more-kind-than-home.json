are just a few of the cliches in this book 1 egomaniacal preacher who is heavily into snakes poison and of course selected ladies of his congregation2 kind and loving father who was abused by his father3 father of the above grandfather of child character just happens to return at just the right moment 4 woman raised in the backwoods who speaks as the conscience of the book5 sheriff with a lot of common sense a painful experience in the past and ennui don't forget the ennui lots and lots of ennui well you get the idea but while you are getting that idea don't get the idea that this book is a waste of time it's an enjoyable read but that's about it enjoyable definitely nothing that all the 4 and 5 star reviews would lead you to believe i'm hoping that mr cash's next effort can live to up at least part of the hype generated by this book now that would be a book worth reading","2":"set in rural north carolina during the mid 80s this is the story of a family's unraveling after the death of their eldest son a mute boy killed during a faith healing at his mother's church the characters were well drawn individuals my only complaint is that the church and the pastor were rather one dimensional","3":" i'm pretty confounded by all the great reviews this book received the story didn't really get going until i was nearly halfway through the voices he chose to tell the story in were all 'bystanders' so i never felt like i was in the story but the biggest problem for me was i felt unmoored i didn't have the most basic details of the characters age race etc i didn't know where they were or what year it was until well past page 50 but then he would get bogged down in minutiae that just pulled me further away three sentences to tell me a character drank a glass of milk it did not kill him or otherwise impact the story i have to say that once the story got going i was interested but i can't help feeling that the real story is still out there and untold","4":"my favorite debut novel in years i was so taken with the language and the story mr cash has an amazing talent for pulling readers in and not letting them go until he is ready to bravo","5":"i don't read a lot of southern fiction and after finishing this one i wonder why if you're 'from around here' the characters are backlit by people you know the nc mountains are a wonderful and strange place","6":" great southern flavor wonderful characters and a heartfelt and too often tragic story all add up to make for a great summer read i'm a sucker for southern lit and this book with its poison drinking snake handling christians with kids caught in circumstances beyond their control with dialogue that seemed so right to me did not let me down my only issue with the book came in the last chapter where a character i met at the beginning of the book and very much liked wrapped up the story to me the last couple of pages seemed a little too preachy and it felt more like the author was speaking to me than that the character was other than that minor quibble i loved this novel thank you to the publisher for providing an advance copy for my review","7":"i loved the characters even when i hated them couldn't put it down great story looking forward to this authors next project","8":"great read very reminiscent to daniel woodrell's books","9":"i was intrigued and nervous about reading this book i was very much interested in a story about a group of worshipers who are involved in sensational practices such as snake handling and healing this seemed to make for an interesting setting for a mystery or suspense story i was worried that the author would paint all christians or religious people with a broad brush as being kooks or crazy my worries were unfounded and it turned out to be a wonderfully told story full of intrigue set in a southern rural locale the strange practices of the church inevitably bring tragedy to peoples lives tragedy which eventually comes to the hall family the story is told from three persons point of view adelaide lyle who has acted as midwife for most of the children in the area and most of the children that attend the church sheriff clem barefield whose own tragic past affects his present dealings with the halls we also see the story through jess hall he is the younger of the two hall children and brother to christopher a boy everyone else calls stump the story revolves around what happens to stump in the church one sunday ben's curiosity caused him to spy in to the church that morning and what he saw told him that there is more going on than people outside the church realize the book climaxes with violence and with some sense of justice just not what the reader might expect overall this book was a great read with a great sense of atmosphere and suspense wiley cash demonstrated a great ability to convey life in a rural setting and that people aren't always what they seem","10":"the beginning of the book forced me to read nonstop but later in the plot the story lagged i think the author could have used a good editor still on the whole a good book","11":"i was loving this book the characters the place the setting but then it seemed like the author did not know where to take the book and just finished it it felt very unfinished even hurried","12":"southern religion at its worst snakes and all a young boy witnesses the tragic consequences of a religious mother trapped in a relationship with the delusional pastor who controls his congregation with fear a must read","13":" i just found the next book i will choose for my book buddies binding moments members the southern setting and speech evokes familiar faces and attitudes yet incorporates the unfamiliar i've never attended a pentecostal church service healing especially one with snakes the 3 voices in this novel jess the young boy adelelaide the older woman and clem the sheriff are as compelling as the poisonwood bible girls or scout in to kill a mockingbird to which this book was compared i was reluctant to put this story down and hope my fellow readers will enjoy the story as well","14":"fantastic i highly encourage you to listen in audiobook format fantastic listening to the story as an audiobook","15":" read for my novel workshop at times this book had me turning pages and at other times i wasn't very interested one of the blurbs calls it a thriller and i definitely have to disagree with that i think what cash does really well is create a portrait of this small town and the characters who inhabit it the entire novel is written in different first person perspectives and he uses dialect convincingly i was really impressed that he was able to pull it off without being annoying or condescending i think i would have given this book four stars if not for the ending i found it unsatisfying and a little anti climactic even a little typical and cliche that's not to say it wasn't realistic reality can sometimes be cliche i suppose but that didn't make me like the ending any more one of the main characters didn't even get a final pov chapter and i can't think of a good reason for that the characters in this book were really well constructed though and that made the novel a pleasure to read especially because of the dialect there were lots of excellent metaphors and delightful turns of phrases that made reading the book feel something like digging in the sand and finding little treasures","16":"cash writes his first novel well but leaves a few loose strands in the story i enjoyed the different voices relaying the story and seeing the different perspectives of each individual what amazes me is the sheepish quality of people who are easily swayed by a powerful speaker i felt that the book had so many disappointments for many of the characters stump is a tragic figure who possesses a doomed existence i felt stump's fall the most poignant","17":" quoted from the publisher a stunning debut reminiscent of the beloved novels of john hart and tom franklin a land more kind than home is a mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western north carolina town i'm not certain i'd use the word stunning but wiley cash's debut is good i am in agreement that there's a moodiness to the story reminiscent of tom franklin and john hart fans of these authors might give this a try i don't think i can do much better describing the book than the above blurb but here's my thoughts serpents preachers forked tongues tent revivals and hallelujah was my first impression i don't like snakes and when they're used for healing i like them even less this made me wonder if i could make it through the story the opening scene of a copperhead coming fang to hand with an elderly parishioner was almost enough to make me drop the book it also did nothing to encourage me to be part of this church and immediately made me dislike the snake handling minister i'm glad i put my phobia aside and read on i liked the use of character point of view 3 that cash used in narration it allowed the happenings to unfold slowly and then with a edgy tension that i loved of course there were more people involved but we learn about them from a midwife the sheriff and the younger of the two brothers mentioned above there's an underlying steaminess evocative of heat to the story which is strange because there's also a whole lot of snow and cold in the story's location of marshall north carolina my favorite character was jess the younger brother his relationship with his older brother nicknamed stump but called by his christian name christopher by his mother is poignant yet rings true with the normal rivalry of brothers in any family stump who never speaks and jess have a way of communicating without words and their strong bound is apparent and an important aspect of the story my least favorite character chambliss is the manipulating evil preacher jess's parents and paternal grandfather who shows up half way through the story are solid and interesting jess questions where his grandfather's been all this time and why so long the answer in part i just have he said i just went away why he sat there quiet like he was thinking hard about what he wanted to say next and then i saw his head turn like he was looking over his shoulder because sometimes we do things we can't take back and we need to go away and leave folks alone and let them forget us for a while what did you do lots of things he said the last character i'll mention is sheriff barefield who has a job to do and despite his painful past manages to do it well small towns have lots of secrets and marshall is no exception these secrets and those that hold them are revealed as the book picks up momentum to a satisfying conclusion","18":"i really liked it but the ending was rushed and didn't gel with the rhythm of the story","19":"i really loved this book from beginning to end the author captures all of the characters in a way that you feel you know them and can feel their deep emotions the relationship between jess and his brother stump was so real and truthful the story is so powerful in human emotions wiley cash has a true gift of story telling","20":"a very quick read shallow","21":"5 stars for the writing 3 stars for the story","22":" wiley cash is a wonderful writer as i read it seemed as if he were talking to me across the kitchen table the voices of his characters are clear distinct and memorable he does a particularly wonderful job with jess the little boy who helps to drive the plot there's an undercurrent of evil that runs throughout the book there's never a doubt that it's man made and that it's part of the fabric of everyday life well intentioned people do bad things without meaning to bad people can behave well and the smallest actions can have outsized consequences even when people do their best cash seems to suggest there's no guarantee that all will be well there's a greek tragedy aspect to a land more kind than home that in no way detracted from my pleasure in reading the book i suspect it will stay with me for a while","23":"this is one of those rare books i prefer to listen to because the readers 3 do such a great job bringing the book to life in a way i wouldn't be able to","24":" the novel is set in a small town in the mountains of nc and much of the action centers around pastor chambliss and the people of his church a church whose services take place in a building with newspaper covered windows the book is also about families at least three generations and about connections across generations and between townspeople it's also about forgiveness and loss and moving on but mostly this superbly written novel is about a young boy named jess and all of the hard lessons that he had to learn over a very short period of time some especially good things that i like about the book are the way that cash so successfully uses dialogue of the area and the clear and crisp way in which he describes a scene or a person or a feeling the reader can see sister adelaide sitting all alone beside chambliss in the dark church right before he stuck her arm into the crate hear jess crying mama and see the steam rising from the body of the sheriff's son there were moments when scenes were so vivid that i didn't know whether i could read another paragraph but then i just had to know what came next the suspenseful and beautifully written book is a reminder that all of us are who we are largely because of the places that we live and the families that we were born into comment | permalink","25":" one of the best things in life is to start a new book and what makes it even better is when you can't put the book down because it's so incredibly good maybe because i'm picky or get bored easily new books don't always hold my attention and my excitement to seems to fizzle halfway into them well this book is the exception as it was amazing heartbreaking gripping and haunting if goodreads allowed me to give it 10 stars i would i'm not sure how i came across this book but was glad to see that my friend linda loved it so i knew i had stumbled onto something good all of the characters are memorable i felt such a range of emotions for each of them especially the two young boys jess and christopher it's somewhat of a thriller and a definite page turner that you'll find hard to put down at the same time it's beautifully written wiley cash's words will make you feel as though you can hear see taste and feel everything happening in the small appalachian town of marshall","26":"a tragic story with a deep hopeful meaning","27":"very solid first novel i enjoyed it very much and read it quickly i love the voices of the narrators especially jess loved how the author describes the relationship between the brothers and how christopher stump appears through his younger brother's eyes very moving and heartfelt southern fiction","28":"absolutely gorgeous a must read","29":"really good book i was transported to the south every time i opened the cover i got lost in it","30":" this one took some getting into but it grows on you my reservations about it were first it was difficult to figure out when the story was taking place the setting is rural north carolina and the characters are mainly from impoverished backgrounds so no detecting modern day via electronic media and they speak of using outhouses but at some point something happened which placed it in the 1980's the second was where the author was going with his characters it seems that the story is really about jess a not yet teenager who spends a lot of time with his older brother christopher a k a stump stump is mute but not deaf and not intellectually impaired this one is destined to be an oprah pick because of its gloomy ending","31":"the novel involves a pentecostal church as in snake handling in rural western north carolina a mute boy is killed during a healing service the boy saw his mother and the preacher in a compromising situation was his death murder or an accident the story is told in three voices by the younger brother of the deceased boy the sheriff and an elderly woman who believed the local children were in danger from the preacher each character and their voice is on target and memorable part suspense part literary fiction and well executed i will definitely read more by this author i especially appreciate that the author did not trash church in general but showed the good along with the bad","32":"rarely does a book make me gasp out loud this one did strong strong debut from mr cash","33":"this is a great first novel by an author with ties to nc and wv can't wait to read his next novel due out in january 2014","34":"this is a first novel by a fellow thomas wolfe society member and the title comes from the ending of a wolfe novel uses three narrators to tell a dark story about boys and others led astray by an evil minister in a small southern town there's religion but no redemption family but not much love and nothing good happens to anyone but i read it avidly finishing in less than two days and i will probably read wiley's next book too","35":"this was a great first novel by this author i hope he is working on another book because i can't read to read more by him the story is told by three different narrators all with a different stake in the story and their small town but wiley cash did a good job of giving me enough background information on each of these characters and making me see the story so well through their eyes that i never felt lost or confused my heart is still breaking for jess hall and all of the pain and tragedy he experienced","36":"this is a really powerful book while the core subject matter isn't something that i enjoyed the author created such an incredible story line that i couldn't put it down the characters are rich and wiley cash exposes both their strengths and weaknesses as they deal with each other the story has rich layers to it and it builds to a crescendo that resolves like a greek tragedy this is a very compelling southern novel","37":" i can't say enough good things about this book i loved it anytime a book moves me to cry i know it's something very special and this book did it several times my heart simply ached when jess looks at his older brother's body in miss lyle's house and remembers the two of them in their bedroom at home and how his brother's breathing puts him to sleep and how he knows that even though his brother looks like he is sleeping on miss lyle's bed he knows he's not i liked how the plot sort of lazily unfolds as the three narrators tell their stories much like the pace of life in the south during a hot summer it's just beautifully written and it left me wanting more books by this author","38":"i enjoyed aspects of this book but mostly i felt like the author was just trying too hard","39":" this is a book that i may not have read except i saw it recommended on goodreads the inside scoop on a so called christian 'snake handlers' church in appalachia potential spoiler with a charalatan preacher narrated by 1 a kid 2 a church lady and 3 the sherriff do you see the potential for tedioisity wrong this is an account of a time when things went terribly wrong for a number of people and yet how they came to terms with their circumstances and life goes on if you get hooked on this story there will be times it wouldn't surprise me if you want to just jump right into the book and set folks straight on what's the way to go and the way to steer clear a great character study of individuals and group dynamics","40":"again this was a book club book and not one i would have picked to read on my own but i did enjoy the book this was wiley cash's first book and was very well written very disturbing events occur be warned three or four of the main characters narrated different chapters therefore giving their own versions of the story and insights into themselves the author pulled this off very smoothly","41":"great read and a quick one at that","42":" loved this book especially because it was set in western north carolina a place where my grandparents lived the location resonated with me and fit this story perfectly stump a child that is mute lives with his very religious mother and quiet brooding father stump's mom takes him to a holy roller church where they handle snakes drink poison and play with fire all in the name of the lord when tragedy strikes the church many secrets are uncovered a great story from a new writer loved it","43":" i would have given this novel 2 stars from an enjoyment perspective but i begrudgingly gave it 3 stars because it was quite well written as a cancer survivor i feel i have had about enough darkness in my life and don't really need any more from fiction i knew there would be dark themes but i was hopeful that there would be more redemption and hopefulness in the end basically a charlatan preacher held sway over vulnerable people in the mountains of north carolina in that the theme was something of a cliche and even somewhat offensive to this southerner i did not enjoy this novel and would not recommend it to others","44":"i reckon it's a pretty good book if you get it in your head to read one and you don't mind if folks do a little hollering","45":"best book i have read all year highly recommend this book","46":"wow what a page turner heartbreaking yet redemptive this one really packs a punch","47":"this is the most i've ever paid for an ebook i want my money back had to force myself to finish it","48":"i really liked this book the only reason why i did not give it 5 stars is because i thought the end was rushed and left several issues unresolved","49":"the story started slow but soon picked up speed wonderful character development i would have liked to have had the preacher and julies version of the events the glimpse inside that relationship was far too brief this is a book that makes you think about religion and secrecy and how bad that combo can turn out i was thinking about this story long after i finished the book the ending left open the possiblility of a sequel i would love to see the characters continue on in a next book i look forward to future books by wiley cash","50":"this book reminded me of to kill a mockingbird early in the book two brothers do something that they should not have done and something tragic results the story is told from the viewpoint of three characters and is really more about all of the characters in the novel than it is about the tragedy that occurred it takes place in rural north carolina the area and the lifestyles are very unfamiliar to me and the author brought me fully into them","51":"great build up and characters crazy ending","52":"this was a good southern read reminded me of john harts novels only thing i didn't like was how it would jump from present to past events with no transitions otherwise would've been a 4 star","53":"this is a really great book if anyone is looking for something to read","54":"i love a southern story told by a southern writer who has an ear for the nuances of the story and of the language in which it is told wiley cash has hit a homerun with his first novel in my opinion his characters were well defined and his story was compelling although its outcomes were pretty predictable once i got into the book i did not want to stop reading kudos to a fellow north carolinian","55":" i read an advance reader's edition of this book which comes out later this spring the story which revolves around a rogue preacher and a faith healing gone wrong leaves a number of questions unanswered but that's it's only weakness voiced through three characters a midwife a sheriff and the younger brother of the victim cash's debut tale provides a clear sense of place excellent character development and a clear story line with just enough backstory to define all of the character relationships there was room for more detail but the author's restraint in providing it kept the story crisp and compelling i did not want this book to end and i will certainly read wiley cash's next effort","56":" a fantastic debut read about life in north carolina and the destruction that one evil preacher can bring to a town of believers and most especially to one family the story is told through 3 narratives jess who is 9 clem who is the sheriff with his own tragic loss pinned on his chest and dear old adelaide who has left the church and taken the children with her to sunday school at her home so that they may be protected what kind of church needs the children to not be there only a very bad one and this one has newspaper on the windows and is run by evil personified and he is all dressed up as a saviour this story is sad heartbreakingly so but there is redemption found between two men with the most tragic of things in common it is hard to go into what i loved about this without giving too much of the story away the writing is very well done the voice of jess filled with confusion and fear and most touchingly the love for his brother christopher i really liked this book and i can't wait to read more from this author","57":"a southern saga based in the mountains of north carolina using four voices a 10 year old boy whose mute brother is killed during a church healing ceremony the local sheriff the sunday school teacher who disagrees with the preacher's ways and the father betrayal infidelity alcohol abuse etc not as good as john hart","58":"i really liked this first novel it takes place in the western mountains of north carolina a mother takes her autistic son to her faith healing pastor and he dies in the church the story is told through the eyes of the boy's brother the local sheriff and an older woman who looked after many of the local children it is a very compelling and strong book","59":"the plot did not completely satisfy me which is what keeps this at a perfectly acceptable liked of 3 stars the evocation of the north carolina mountains a place very near indeed to where i was born and raised was top notch writing","60":" i've always been drawn to stories that take place in small towns like this one in north carolina the author wiley cash painted a vivid picture of this tragic story as it unfolds through the perspective of each of the characters who were involved whether it was the young brother jesse hall who had a mute older brother stump that his mother was determined to have saved by the town preacher or the town sheriff clem who had his doubts about the pastor and his ways along with the neighbor woman adelaide who had to witness more than she wanted they all had their own personal histories that gave weight to the entire story and it's parade of characters this a is a great first time novel by wiley cash and a highly moving story that most fiction readers will love to dive into","61":"have to agree that the audio version is great","62":"i don't know that i have ever given 5 stars to a book but i am with this one i loved it i listened to it on audio and the narrators were amazing","63":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book it was descriptive engaging and the characters were well developed and believable the story is told from the perspective of three different characters each of the characters bring a unique piece to the overall story i hope to read more from this author in the future","64":"set in an area of north carolina that was very familiar to me certainly added to the enjoyment of reading this book the author weaves the story and the characters in such a way that i was captivated from start to finish it seems that sorrow dominates stories set in appalachia and this one is no different still the writing is powerful and stole my heart like so many of the of these southern stories do good old fashioned story telling","65":" while i read this book i kept thinking this really isn't very good i should start reading something else yet for some reason i kept going back to it i think it was the promise that something truly shocking was going to happen by the end and i am glad i finished it because the ending was rather shocking yet getting there was very difficult the characters were cliche and didn't stand out in my mind physical descriptions of characters was lacking i couldn't clearly picture anyone in my mind the voices of the three narrators didn't vary enough for me to justify having three of them i think the story would've worked better told just from jess's pov his narrative was the most interesting to me i did not see how the backstories of the sheriff and miss lyle mattered and was frankly bored by some if these long and painstakingly detailed flashbacks i also think there were some technical issues with the flashbacks there also didn't need to be so many jess was my favorite character and is the one who kept me turning the pages the writing didn't really stand out for me but the story was interesting and the ending was heartbreaking","66":"i couldn't put this book down i really liked the characters and didn't want it to end great suspense","67":"a little like to kill a mockingbird in the way it portrays the innocence of the narrator ending was not what i'd hoped for but the story is told with beauty","68":"great audiobook both the writing and the narration finally a good book","69":"i stayed up all night with this one","70":"this is really quite a disturbing story filled with the death of a child crazy blind faith and a lot of anger yet it was really well written i would read another from this author he just needs to seriously tone down the drama","71":"while it took a while for me to fully dive in with this book once i did it was so worth it the characters were developed perfectly the language was authentic and the writing was amazing it really reminded me of to kill a mockingbird with the way it was written which made me love it a billion times more enjoyed this novel a lot","72":"a wonderful first novel read it in one day","73":"this is a mesmerizing first novel the use of the three narrators is a clever and effective device points of view are always important and the use of the three creates different voices fears and information i read many of the goodreads reviews and while readers still persist in telling the story i found more nuanced thoughtful reviews for this novel cash deserves praise for this debut the novel soars and it is difficult to walk away from it the dialect the characters the setting are pitch perfect this is one of the best books i have read in several years","74":" it is hard to believe that this is a debut novel told from several points of view with a polished assuredness usually found in authors of more experience the story advances with inner visions that are specific and spellbinding the plot has elements that are familiar apt comparisons have been made to greek tragedy but the execution is never rushed the details never neglected the twin themes of despair and redemption are fully realized in an interview wiley cash credits ernest gaines for encouraging him to write what he knows and he does this beautifully i look forward to much success and a fine future for this young writer","75":"a wonderful book i couldn't put down i read it in 24 hours i'm so glad i read it","76":"if you like john hart this is for you i have recently become a fan of southern lit maybe you have to live here even as a come here to get into it but the story is plain but gritty sensitive and real","77":"three and a half stars wonderfully evocative sense of place but the ending seemed so abrupt and i was left with a lot of questions about the characters' motivations unsettling book to say the least","78":"an enjoyable quick read about people involved in one of those strange southern snake churches good characters","79":"excellent book and one that i had a really hard time putting down i am really looking forward to reading more from this author","80":" this book is like a punch in the gut it hits you unexpectedly and it hurts and yet i couldn't look away i'd been meaning to read it since it was published to huge critical acclaim a year ago just because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about now i get it i listened to the audiobook and it was outstanding the story is told from three points of view - jess hall a nine year old boy adelaide lile an elderly midwife and clem barefield the town sheriff three different readers performed these roles and their accents and inflection seemed so authentic that they transported you right back to the \"scene of the crime \"and there was definitely a crime scene in this book christopher jess's mute older brother dies mysteriously in a healing ritual in his rural north carolina church the publisher calls this book a \"literary thriller \" and while it's clear early on who committed the crime and why the suspense lies more in how things will resolve themselves the murder sets in motion a chain of events that will change the characters' lives forever will jess's father become like his own violent alcoholic father will clem barefield be able to separate these tragic events from those he's experienced in his past this book touches on many of the darkest aspects of the human experience it makes you feel the wrenching hopelessness of loss and the anger and frustration that gets passed down through generations it also portrays the insularity of small rural towns where secrecy still reigns and where people see only what they choose to and look the other way in order to protect their own and yet through all the anger and grief in this book there is still love - sometimes misplaced sometimes destructive but achingly real this is a stunning powerful novel","81":"i had a hard time getting into this book but i blame at least part of that on the fact that i borrowed it from the library as an adobe epub which makes you feel like you're reading a really long document instead of a book","82":"great read what a wonderful storyteller can't wait to read his next one this dark road to mercy","83":" jess hall has been told more than once not to spy on grownups but the newspaper covering the windows of the church his mother goes to only makes it more tempting and when the minister decides that his mute brother is the one child who gets to go in it's too much to resist one look is enough to ruin the lives of many a land more kind than home is a tale of a small town filled with both good and evil where paths cross and people are forced back into each other's lives jess' grandfather is suddenly around and back in the shadow of clem the local sheriff who has good reason to never want to see him again the local midwife adelaide lyle questions whether she should have ever let jess' brother out of her hands that morning when she'd been so diligent to keep all the children close to her and away from the church with the papered windows told through the eyes of jess clem and adelaide a strong narrative is built that shows the interlocking web of life for the good and the bad in a small town and how sometimes the smallest are made to pay for the sins of others","84":"it was ok not terrible but not a story i'd really recommend to anyone either the plot wasn't engaging the characters weren't well developed but it was worth finishing at least","85":"$u0026amp up i did appreciate how the sheriff reacted to miss lyle's ridiculous hyperbole of how she loved her sunday schoolchildren like they were her own people only nice prose although i got a bit bogged down in the descriptions of the landscape a bit meandering repetitive and skim worthy a little self consciously trying to be a downer cliched chracters that make you want to take them by the shoulders and shake them hard and then slap them across the face and scream at them to wake the #%$u0026amp up i did appreciate how the sheriff reacted to miss lyle's ridiculous hyperbole of how she loved her sunday schoolchildren like they were her own people only say that when they want to be personally involved in other people's drama i love it when authors call shenanigans on stupidity but this ain't no steinbeck more like springer i've always thought of snake handlers and snickered but this book makes them seem quite sinister indeed still i couldn't help but think of moe syzalak all the way through i was born a snake handler and i'll die a snake handler","86":"the book grabs you keeps you interested and holds you tight the characterizations are well written and vividly portrayed i'm not much for southern literature usually but i totally enjoyed this story it is a sad story beautifully written","87":"really more like 3 5 stars this novel was beautifully written and i loved all the different perspectives for writing style alone i'd give it 5 stars but the story to me was unbearably sad and for that i gave it 3 5 stars","88":"economical describes cash's prose the story mildly interesting same for characters i like a simple plot that's more of a character study but this was just bland i did finish it so it wasn't just awful it's called a thriller but wasn't thrilling","89":" absolutely flooring debut novel from wiley cash a north carolina native who is now a west virginian i was drawn to this book because it was hyped as southern literature and fully lives up to those generalizations it's so much more than that though cash details the story of a small town gripped by the polluted brainwashing of a traveling preacher who gets his greasy roots into the heart of a beautiful community heartbreaking at times i enjoyed how the story was told from multiple viewpoints but especially through the eyes of its young boy protagonist the imagery is superb and reminded me a lot of gap creek but unlike the main characters in that novel the overtones here are of perseverance rather than failure if you've ever traveled through a step back in time town this book's for you","90":"southern fiction often reminds us that evil exists where we least expect to find it and that we let our guards down at our own risk wiley cash's disturbing debut novel a land more kind than home set deep inside the rural north carolina of the mid eighties takes this approach there is plenty of evilness in cash's story and most of it is buried in one charismatic preacher's heart sometimes nine year old jess hall even though he has an older brother feels like he is the oldest child in the family his brother who carries the unfortunate nickname \"stump \" is severely autistic and has never spoken jess loves stump dearly and has routinely assumed the burden of watching out for his brother when the two of them are outdoors on their own but one day jess cannot protect stump from the evil that has entered their home and although jess curses the momentary cowardice that led him to run off and abandon stump to his fate he will fail stump one more time - with tragic consequences a land more kind than home explores the power of deeply held religious faith to blind true believers to the evil within those whom they trust the most pastor chambliss whose church the boys' mother attends has a criminally checkered past and is not a man to tolerate people spying on him unfortunately jess and stump who greatly enjoy the thrill of spying on adults inadvertently do spy on the preacher one day with lasting consequences that will impact their entire community this is a story of good vs evil one that explores what can happen when evil is allowed to have its way unchallenged it is about a community's responsibility to protect its children even when their mother fails to do so it is about secrets the kind that can get people killed ruin marriages or allow one man callously to exploit for decades those who trust him most it is southern fiction at its best and wiley cash has claimed a well deserved spot for himself within the genre","91":" this book was fairly good although it had some things that most people wouldn't consider bad but bug me it was told from three points of view all first person which is okay but you have to remember which person is speaking they have separate chapters so maybe it's just me the three points of view are a 9 year old boy a middle aged sheriff and an 81 year old woman so most people would not have trouble keeping track of them but that wasn't my issue my issue and it's only mine i'm sure no one else's is that it takes place in north carolina and they all speak in that down homey southern rambling folksy stream of consciousness way that i find distracting and pretentious in a book sample passage she was a storyteller if there ever was one and she'd shell beans into a patch quilt she'd spread out across her lap and talk about my dead mama and daddy like they'd just stepped out into the yard to check the sky for rain clouds or i dropped my head and closed my eyes just like i'd seen joe bill do and for a minute i couldn't hear nothing at all except for a few birds fussing in the trees above us and the sound of the breeze coming through the dry grass and after a minute i couldn't even hear that but then real slow the singing of the crickets raised p out of the woods behind me and their chirping sound like somebody was scratching a spoon across a clean dinner plate and past that across the railroad tracks on the other side of the woods i cold hear the river running slow toward marshall and it ws so soft that i wondered if i was making it up or remembering the sound of it just because it was supposed to be there yeah yeah i know if you like that kind of stuff fine but i found myself skimming over whole paragraphs not something i usually do just enough suspense and human interest to keep me going until the end when i read the less i'm thinking about the way it's written and the more i'm enjoying the story the happier i am i can never fully delve in when i can picture the writer in a corner of my mind laboring over how he's going to put things","92":"love the book especially the different perspectives on the story the three narrators give you the depiction of the rural southern culture was very realistic and the characters were rich and well developed","93":"i tried 3 times to get into this book but i'm not going to try again i'm disappointed in really thought this would be good judging from the reviews time is too short for mediocre books so i'm moving on","94":"very interesting enjoyed it very much looking forward to more of his writing","95":"awesome story from an nc boy couldn't put it down hate that it is over suspenseful","96":"born in north carolina raised in an evangelical church wiley cash draws on his own personal experiences to produce this impressive debut novel one sunday in the oppressive summer heat the congregation of river road church take their religious fervour one step too far with devastating consequences this compelling story set in madison county in 1986 is narrated from the perspectives of three different characters jess hall nine year old brother to christopher stump whose autism hinders any verbal communication clem barefield sheriff of madison county for 25 years yet still considered an outsider and finally adelaide lyle elderly spinster who leads the sunday school yet remains wary of the pastor carson chambliss chambliss is a very shady character one of those larger than life mesmerizing preachers who rules his ingenuous congregation with a rod of iron as well as traumatising them with snakes poison and fire blind faith indeed this may be the 80s but this could be the land that time forgot there's a great sense of place as the narrative moves from present to past and back again evoking the seasons and landscape of this timeless setting the author also seems very much in tune with his characters ordinary down to earth folk who try to get by the best they can with perhaps one glaring exception if you enjoy well told stories with that languid laconic vibe you find in the best southern fiction you will relish this gripping poignant tale looking forward to hearing more from madison county in wiley cash's future novels","97":"amazing story beautifully written","98":"this is a story of tragedy and sadness it reminds me of the circle of life how karma plays a part in everyones lived and even the saying the sins of the father fall back on the child excellent book great characters i really enjoyed it","99":"a fabulously crafted well written debut novel i finished it last night and am still thinking about it","100":"liked the multiple narrators but would have had a hard time keeping them apart if i had not paid attention to the chapter headings so perhaps their voices could have been more distinctive certainly not warm fuzzy story but i'm not sure it could have ended any other way and still been believable the snake handling worship thing gave me the willies","101":"this is a beautifully written and powerful debut novel by a southern author wiley cash it is a hard book to read and a hard book to put down this heart wrenching and tragic tale is told through three first person narratives the first narrator is the town healer adelaide lyle whom had witnessed and experienced the heinous and evil acts of the charismatic preacher carson chambliss in the past disturbed by all that she has witnessed she has forbidden any children from being present during his services and provides them with bible school lessons in her home while the parents attend the second narrator is nine year old third grader jess hall the younger brother of thirteen year old christopher who was nicknamed stump by a heartless tobacco agent when he was a toddler christopher is mute and autistic and the agent tells the father that he just stands there like a stump jess looks out for his brother but cannot protect him from the heinous and narcissistic pastor that decides to utilize a laying on of hands type healing to cure christopher his motives are far from being pure and altruistic and christopher dies the third narrator is the town sheriff clem barefield the sheriff has his own past tragedies to deal with and relive while he investigates christopher's death this tragic and thought provoking novel will at times have you reading with anger with outrage and with frustration at the impotence of the character's actions and their gullibility it will raise your maternal and paternal hackles this novel will make you care about the characters and you will not be reading dispassionately four stars excellent debut novel well done wiley cash","102":" i feel sorry for other books now i finished a land more kind than home this morning and i don't know how it can be topped cash's debut novel centers around brothers jess and christopher hall everyone calls him \"stump\" because he has never uttered a word it has everything a crooked church pastor snakes an affair a \"healing\" gone wrong a jealous husband gunshots... so good the story is enough to keep you entertained but what impressed me the most was cash's ability to use the english language in a way that will give you goosebumps if you are a tom franklin fan you'll be a wiley cash fan that's for sure","103":"good and truth will stand under scrutiny evil will not sometimes evil will come in where good abides the innocent pay the price this story is one of a southern church where biblical practices are upheld including faith healing and snake handling an opportunistic pastor uses the people's faith against them and one family pays the greatest price the violence that was sure to come and then the redemption that follows allow the community to move on and allow the reader to get lost in the plot but something else is at work here something that distinguishes this wonderful book from just another episode of criminal minds as much as bridget jones diary from pride and prejudice writing as simple powerful and beautiful as poetry and characters as human and flawed as we know ourselves to be this is what kept me reading until the very end","104":"really torn between 3 and 4 stars on this one but as a debut novel it certainly shows some writing talent wonderfully written seamlessly unfolds the story from several viewpoints and interesting plot while slightly predictable the ending also held some elements of irony e g grandfather's second chance a son for a son i think i was just hoping for a little more from the ending overall good easy read will be looking forward to more from wiley cash","105":"i really enjoyed the writing so much in this book i don't want to spoil anything but this would have been 5 stars for me except for one character whose actions i didn't find totally believable the male characters were better written than the females","106":"difficult to choose a rating with this book full of damaged people fear abuse loss of hope and more but very good at the same time in this small mountain community drink and abuse is common children have little hope of growing up normal a fake minister is able to twist and turn the people to do his bidding and almost gets away with murder on more than one level innocence is destroyed and no one sees but one and she is too frightened to say anything maybe a glimmer of hope at least for the optimist","107":"the story really drags you in and makes you a part of this little southern town and its people and how the past has impacted their lives today how someone like chambliss and his followers can continue to suck people into their sick religious practices never ceases to amaze me there is a lot of sadness in this book and unresolved anger and hurt it is however beautifully written","108":"i found this book to be really engaging and well written can't believe it is this author's first book heart wrenching and totally believable","109":" i was first recommended a land more kind than home from a dear friend who had read it in one of her writing classes this past semester i have not been this wrapped up in a book in a long time which is particularly significant because i tend to stick to sci fi dystopian etc for non class readings yet from the first line to the p s extras at the end i was engrossed with wiley cash's story three things that stuck out were the multiple perspectives tool the characters and the presence of religion i am a little picky on multiple perspectives i love and avoid them at the same time partially because i've read some stories where the effect is too drastic and the story suffers for it at the same time i've read plenty where it's executed excellently and i think it happens here adelaide lyle jess hall and clem barefield take turns telling a somber story of life death and all of their friends in madison county each character is written with distinctive voices and personality traits they as well as the other townsfolk really drive the story which is intriguing in itself the presence of religion and the debate of humans playing god make you question moral ethics in these people and might even make you reflect on yourself or your characters if you are a writer i'll save the details for spoiler reasons but i urge you fellow reader to check this story out even if it falls outside of your favorite genre you may fall in love with it","110":"once i started it i didn't want to put it down but it was so sad","111":"phenomenal debut cannot recommend this book highly enough excellent narrative written with lyrical prose","112":"a rich story set in western north carolina 13 year old stump hall dies at the hands of the parishioners at his church a mute the church was attempting to heal him all hell breaks loose as the family and the community try to seek some answers","113":" this book is captivating the writing style is as far as i can remember similar to these is my words it is lyrical and poetic while written in the style of speaking in a small north carolina town there are three narrators throughout the book beginning with addie a somewhat elderly spinster who has seen a lot through her years and adds different layers to the story she knows and remembers things that the others do not she begins directly after a child's funeral his death is mysterious but those who weren't present have suspicions the mother of the child returns from the funeral and announces that the pastor wants a word with addie who is not a fan of the pastor's so much not a fan that she took the children from the church when one of the members of the congregation died from a snake bite during an act of faith the second narrator is little jess hall jess is 9 years old and the brother of the dead child he sees and understands things the others don't he is an integral part of the story and part of the powerful conclusion it is his voice that provides the facts leading up to his brother's death it is also through him that we discover that his brother christopher or stump as he is commonly called is a mute both boys provide an innocence that can only be found in children in a small town the last narrator is clem the sheriff clem is a transplant from another county he carries some baggage but tries to keep his own feelings out of the way he conducts his work there are hard feelings between him and at least one of the other characters in the book which is poetically and tragically healed each chapter provides just a little more information and a lot more depth to the book the narrators recall different moments when times were different turning points for each of them the actual meat of the story is only over the course of a few days possibly up to a week through the narrators though much more time and history is covered this would be an excellent choice for a book club there are endless points of discussion that include but are not limited to comparing and contrasting different characters and how they handled similar circumstances examining present day religious abuses how god continues to bless in spite of evil i would also really enjoy a good discussion on comparing the pastor with his snakes maybe add the idea of adam and eve in the garden of eden and the serpent which is not included in the book but clearly not far from the author's thoughts how religion can be polluted by greed and power and used and abused and then there is the irony of many things that would be spoilers darn it all there really are so many points of discussion it leaves the reader thinking long after the last page","114":"for me i will hold this book in the same regard with flannery o'connor darkly wonderful","115":"it was well written i just didn't like the subject matter or the story","116":"i was truly impressed with this story a land more kind than home is a debut novel by wiley cash he did a great job a wonderful story that will steal your heart","117":"slow at the beginning held my interest 3 4 way to end not the best book i have read","118":" this is a story that takes place in the south about a corrupt preacher in a fundamentalist church and a small town family influenced by his actions i have to say that the story did not captivate me and i ended up skimming two thirds of the book just to get through it i did not feel like i had to savor every word although the prose was perfectly fine and i have no major criticism reviews described the book as riveting and i disagree just didn't spark my interest although the latter half of the book was better the characters did not grab me particularly the preacher who plays the villain the best developed character in my opinion ended up being the grandfather so 3 stars because it was perfectly readable and may appeal to others","119":"perhaps a bit too gritty for me i'm not sure if it was a meaningful novel that i'm just too shallow to appreciate or if it truly had something to say about the arrogance of evil was it really about the dangers of faith or was it just a variation on a murder mystery i actually found the meanderings away from the main plot onto all the side roads far more compelling than the actual story","120":"told through three voices a land more kind than home weaves together the tale of rural town whose church is host to some mysterious doings which lead to unfortunate events for the townsfolk the story slowly unfolds from the viewpoint of a boy the town's sheriff and self determined old woman each knows a little more than they should about the local church and each must play their part leading to the unavoidable showdown after the evil antagonist crosses a line sounds great right not so much this story could have been powerfully told as short story with a single narrator but in book form gets a little windy and has whole chapters that i found tangential to the plot should i tell you about them well i could but that would probably ruin it for people who haven't read it yet i will say this i found the old woman's character to be not as important to the plot in relation to the air time she got in the book also because the telling moved from voice to voice i found it hard to build a relationship with the characters and experience their relationships with each other the sum total of that made the book feel like we were going through the motions without the powerful emotional response real empathy creates instead when tragedy strikes i felt the shock of seeing a horrific accident without the grief of knowing the victims and their family which is what good books do they let us know people and when those people experience joy or sorrow we know it too as if we knew them this is style is perfected in to kill a mockingbird southern town tied in political knots a child faces very adult problems and tries to overcome i don't know where this book is trying to take us is it about the lifetime effects of abuse some characters suffered as children is it about the tenacity of the old folk to make it through the hard times is it about the innocent children trying to understand the confusing and sometimes terrifying realities of adult life each one of these themes is rich enough alone for a book if you put all three together you'd think it would triple the intensity but it doesn't each is simultaneously thinned to fit then overinflated making for lots and lots of pages without any depth the pains of the characters are single notes that never quite harmonize into a song another problem i had getting into the book was the use of evil we never really got to know the antagonist or understand his motives since he develops a relationship with a lead character this would really flesh out the emotional realities and give them motivations and complexity instead the antagonist plays more the role of a man in a dark cape in a silent film or worse the bad guy in any given steven king novel the antagonist is simply evil does evil things and you shouldn't think much more about it are you still thinking about the antagonist as a person really don't the antagonist is just evil period eventually they will get theirs and that should be good enough for you stop thinking about it was this as the title and plot summary would have us believe the tale of a harsh and unforgiving rural environment that weighs on its resilient but flawed residents who've been taken by a baddie sort of but not really it's more a thinnish plot that we sort of hum along with to its brief and mostly unsatisfying ending lose the character development and physical descriptions what feels like filler in this book anyway and keep the scenes and dialog and you get a screenplay that would make a decent thriller starring tommy lee jones that's about it it does have some good qualities and the writing is better than most best sellers i can't recommend anyone run out and buy the hardcover but if you picked it up for a few dollars as a trade paperback it's as good a book as any you could read a lot worse","121":"loved the dark atmospheric mood","122":"one of the best books i have read lately story of a family falling apart takes place in the mountains of nw north carolina being familiar with that area and the culture and the people i found the characters are very true to life descriptions of the land are accurate there are some coves that hardly ever see sunlight unless the sun is straight overhead a beautiful story","123":"really good book great book club read","124":"i thought his writing style was \"plain speaking\" but the characters and actions are complex has a very easy style of writing so that the flashbacks and switching between narrators are seamless and it read very much like a linear storyline the flashback technique and the different narrators worked well so the sense of place and characters are revealed in layers takes universal themes of revenge betrayal goodness and evil forgiveness and understanding gives them a distinct appalachia feel he took the \"stereotypes\" that are associated with appalachia and raised them a level very good sense of place - felt like you knew this town - not that you would want to live them my fav narrator was adelaide lyle - probably because she was female but while i liked how she described her history and the area many of her actions i asked myself why this was  very good debut novel and i look forward to reading more from the author i would recommend to those that like southern literature and or stories set in nc","125":"such a sad story poor jess will never be able to live a normal life","126":" this is largely a book about the relationship between two brothers and the dangers and quiet untold stories of one particular evangelical church in their community the boys jess hall and his brother nicknamed stump are largely left on their own to entertain themselves one day the two boys witness their mother engaging in inappropriate behavior and their mistake is a catalyst to everything else that takes place thereafter in the book jess and stump's mother belongs to an evangelical church where snake handling is used to test faith but their father does not attend nor do the children of the church they attend a type of children's services with another member of the church adelaide one day not long after the boys witness their mother's behavior the preacher of the church a rather nefarious man with a questionable history asks stump to begin attending church services the plotline of this book focuses on what happens to stump in the church and the resulting repercussions the book is told through three voices jess hall adelaide lyle a church member who works with the children of the church and clem barefield the town's sheriff who is in charge of investigating everything that takes place i do find this method of telling the story helpful but i can help but feel that that some voices i e jess's mother and father seemed to be missing from the story and even adelaide's voice seemed to lack some history and even true presence during the events we don't have a fully fleshed out character in her nor do i get a strong sense of her thoughts and feelings during the events of the story i liked this book i liked jess as a character but i didn't have a good understanding of too many key characters especially jess's mom and the story's trajectory was too obvious from the beginning to allow the story to have any suspense for me to rate the book more than two stars","127":"this book absolutely blew me away with its simple brilliance i wasn't sure what to expect but the buildup definitely was worth the explosive ending it was beautiful and sad","128":"beautifully written book that takes place in the hills of north carolina i liked this a lot but it has some difficult topics two brothers christopher and jess hall happen to see something that they really shouldn't have seen they just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time as a result their world unexpectedly and tragically unravels around them","129":"i picked this up because the author has the same name as my cousin and i've never seen that before the story is about a mute child that is killed when his mothers church brings him in for a healing the author got side tracked a few times but overall a good book","130":"excellent debut novel with a fast paced plot and three authentic southern voices reminded me a bit of harper lee and of flannery o'connor i've been hitting all 5's lately","131":" a land more kind than homeby wiley casha stunning debut novel that is a tender yet poignant coming of age literary thriller about two brothers and the evil they face in a small western north carolina town this compelling story is captured in the rhythms of appalachian speech and in the pitch perfect voices of the narrators the three narrators are young jess hall adventurous precocious and very protective of his older mute brother called stump adelaid lyle the town midwife and moral conscience and the sheriff clem barefield who has his own painful past their stories resonate with haunting tales of courage in the face of cruelty and how the power of love can overcome the threat of danger and evil although having been warned not to snoop stumps curiosity gets the best of him and what he sees will have catastrophic repercussions destroying both his world and his brothers this leads them into a chilling descent into a world of religious frenzy that capults jess into a premature adulthood this is good old fashioned story telling about a town gripped by a menacing preacher religion murder infidelity guns whiskey and snake handling this is a debut full of lyrical prose with tragic and masterful portrayals written by a truly gifted new writer","132":"excellent and deep tri points of view are used effectively characters are real flawed and relatable","133":" wiley cash's novel is wicked good this depiction of ordinary religious violence seen through the eyes of three characters comes across like a punch to the gut the characters narrators jess adelaide and clem stump ben and julie and pastor chambliss are nuanced and credible the story is well paced and compelling cash takes a close look at the damage caused by religious belief but it's not on the scale of a crusade or jihad the book focuses instead on how belief plays out and can be misshapen by humans most of them well meaning evil has a human form here cash's writing is measured pensive lyrical and striking i can't wait to see more from him and i'm happy to see he has a new book due out next month flannery o'connor fans should love this chambliss stood above me and held on to me tight like i was some kind of hog he was fixing to butcher and he was afraid of me getting away before he'd done it i tried again to jerk my hand free but he held it there tight and i could feel the cold smooth skin of his fingers where they wrapped around my arm 'shhhh ' he whispered 'don't fight it now don't fight it ' i knew my eyes would have to fix themselves against the blackness that had once again taken over the church i closed my eyes and thought about daddy having to see a miracle to believe in it and then i thought about mirages again about how miracles might be like that sometimes it was like mama was lost in the desert and had gotten so thirsty that she was willing to see anything that might make her feel better about being lost i knew that she needed to think she heard stump holler out for her even if i knew he didn't and i wondered if it was a sin to think any less of a miracle just because you know it ain't real","134":"i enjoyed the book possibly more due to its southern setting i felt there were only three characters that i could understand their motivations an even better book also set in the appalachian area with abusive parent and a mystery is ash grove by wanda fries","135":"loved this book i couldn't put it down","136":"loved this book the characters are real the story is compelling and the unraveling of ben and julie just makes you ache way to go wiley cash","137":"3 1 2 stars but i rounded up well told story i liked having the story told from three points of view i especially liked jess and the sheriff's story telling and the sheriff's back story","138":"$24 99 charles manson jim jones david koresh

all in the name of faith healing tnot everyone is drinking chambliss's kool aid though adelaide addie lyle former church member mid wife and one of the narrators of cash's novel knows all too well just what her ex pastor is capable of addie has seen people pick up snakes and drink poison hold fire up to their faces just to see if it would burn them holy people too god fearing folks that hadn't ever acted like that a day in their lives chambliss addie says convinces them that it is safe to challenge the will of god and makes them feel it is all right to take that dare if they believed tan incident that occurred years previously prompted addie to take the children out of the church and teach them at her home instead every sunday curiously chambliss agreed to this since she birthed these children addie feels like she has a right to their spirits cash employs streams of consciousness to get the reader inside addie's head the effect is compelling and highly readable but addie is not alone in her distrust of her ex pastor tsheriff clem barefield another narrator knows chambliss is a man of secrets and lies one of the pastor's hands is severely burned the sheriff knows the damage occurred from a meth lab explosion that not only injured the pastor but also killed a missing girl chambliss required extensive skin grafts but his hand is severely disfigured chambliss of course explains that it was god's will tthe skin grafts help explain chambliss' fascination or rather obsession with snakes the rattles and shed skins of serpents adorn chambliss's barn in a frightening

see something they are not supposed to see their transgression puts stump particularly in chambliss's radar the pastor calls stump to services and believes he can cure the boy of his affliction so do the congregation and stump's mother tcash's characters have little or no education this makes them highly susceptible to a man like chambliss those who attend the river road church of christ in signs following are easily led they believe everything chambliss tells them and they blindly follow his orders whatever they may be tcash sets his story in his home state of north carolina he peoples his book with backwoods types hillbillies even there is an authenticity to his characters cash peppers his prose with reckons ain'ts and fixin' to's he writes them as they really are and the story is better because of it his characters believe in tobacco hard work god and chambliss but not necessarily in that order the atmospheric quality to his writing brings to mind charles frazier ron rash and cormac mccarthy ta land more kind than home is filled with tension there is an inevitability to this tale from as early as page one the reader knows things will not end well the beauty is seeing where cash will take his characters and us tmost beautiful of all though is when jess warns us that miracles are often like mirages in the desert i thought about what a mirage must look like in the desert after you've gotten yourself lost and you ain't had nothing to drink and are just about ready to die i reckon at that point your mind can trick you into seeing just about anything it wants you to see too bad most of the adults in this novel are not as sage as this nine year old boy","139":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here this book was too dark for me to love i really enjoyed it but spoiler alert the death of stump was too upsetting for me i did like the different voices that narrated the story i found it impressive that the author could write equally convincingly as both an elderly woman and a small boy i'll look for more by cash but he's not at the top of my list to read i have been on a streak of novels lately that take place in the south but this one just didn't do it for me like others have","140":"good choice for people who enjoy stories at a steady pace rather than huge peaks in action","141":"enjoyed this book","142":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i feel in love with this book the plot gripped me from the get go and the vivid prose pulled me in even further i felt like a fly on the wall observing every scene i also enjoyed depth of the three narratives from the three completely different perspectives jess seemed wise beyond his years which probably came from caring for a sibling who lives with many challenges i loved adelaide for her courage especially when it came to protecting the children however i was a bit dismayed when sh i feel in love with this book the plot gripped me from the get go and the vivid prose pulled me in even further i felt like a fly on the wall observing every scene i also enjoyed depth of the three narratives from the three completely different perspectives jess seemed wise beyond his years which probably came from caring for a sibling who lives with many challenges i loved adelaide for her courage especially when it came to protecting the children however i was a bit dismayed when she was not more forthcoming with the sheriff i found myself wishing she would just spill the beans and make his investigation a bit easier but then the book would have been much shorter i suppose i was also pleasantly surprised by the complexity of the clem's character being that he was not directly involved with the church or the incident and i found it touching the way cash wove clem's tragic lost of his son with the death of jimmy's son ben being that jimmy was somewhat responsible for the death of clem's son it was a powerful reminder that we can never know in which shoes we will walk one day i did have one small complaint with the book though which was the ending i was shocked to discover in the last chapter that the same folks who suffered so greatly within this church returned it it just didn't seem realistic to me for them especially jess to worship in the same spot where not one but two murders occurred i could imagine them building a new church at a different location or even demolishing the building then starting anew but i felt disconnected from the story with them returning to scene of the crime to worship like nothing had happened i asked mr cash about the ending last night he said it was the only possible conclusion for him that people and places can heal come out of the darkness and change although i fully understand his reasoning it still didn't feel natural to me that being said the poor ending was not enough of a disappointment for me to give it any less than 5 stars more","143":"a maz ing i loved the story the characters and the simple telling of the story since it was set in a familiar area and religion i think i enjoyed it more than i may have if i'd not known anything about the lifestyle of the characters","144":"good book held my interest a real page turner very good first novel will look for more wiley cash","145":"this first novel by the author is set in rural north carolina more or less in the present time the story is related through three or four members of a small community the town sheriff an old woman and the eleven year old son of two of the main characters the plot revolves around a holy roller minister and his fiercely loyal flock and an accident that never should have happened inside his church during a healing ceremony a sub plot deals with another accident that shouldn't have happened several years earlier and a marriage that is falling apart it's a nicely written book using rural carolina speech patterns i finished in three days my wife finished it in four hours it's about 300 pages","146":"sad and crazy book we actually got to talk to the author in our book club so that was pretty cool enjoyed it but it's not in my top books","147":"wiley cash sucks the reader in while the reader helplessly stands by and watches the story unfold almost as if the reader is standing on quicksand be prepared to read the book in one sitting this is not a book to put down and finish reading later","148":"interesting story well written easy read and a good book","149":"i loved this read written with passion and clarity an old lady a young boy and the sheriff tell the sad story the lifestyle of a small town where everybody knows everybody since childhood then a demented man calls himself their pastor and well you have to read it","150":" hmmm well i feel like this book had the potential to be great he did an excellent job capturing the voice of the characters but it felt like he was showing us the characters and we were learning about them but none of them fully revealed and then the story ends it is such a tragic story and it ends and i was left feeling jilted i had invested a lot of time in reading it and then it ends and i feel like the only person who really came full circle was the grandfather very disappointed","151":"i had a hard time deciding if this was a 3 or 4 star i believe i would of given it a 4 star rating if it would of been my fav genre however there was nothing wrong with the book religious zealot and all family tragedy and family spiritual and literal healing i thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend to others","152":"good story good writing i think i probably would have finished this in one sitting if it weren't for pesky little things like work and life getting in the way","153":"i'm not usually a fan of period books but this one is timeless sadly those seeking comfort in religion are often the ones being controlled by it","154":"i loved the book i love the fact that wiley is able to represent the good the bad and the ugly this book is all about forgiveness and the ability to go forward when everything seems wrong a true book on resiliency","155":" wiley cash has a way with words he can make you see a rain storm or love with equal clarity in a land more kind than home he has written a beautiful elegy for love and death faith and fear condemnation and redemption told in three very different voices the tale unfolds in starts and pauses and then backtracks on to itself occasionally cash loses his way and the story loses momentum but stick with him because in the pulsing end you will know you have found a wonderful new voice a land more kind than home follows the inhabitants of a small back country appalachian community they include an outsider sheriff and the drunk the sheriff blames for his son's death the drunk's son and his church obsessed wife their two young sons one a mute a spellbinding preacher with a hidden past and the area's healer woman cash is point perfect in detailing the culture of appalachia the speech patterns of his characters and an atmosphere of foreboding book groups will find a wealth of topics including family dynamics faith and faith that becomes oppressive guilt and how it can poison relationships fear of the unknown outsiders understanding disabilities alcoholism infidelity and secrets","156":"wow this has to be one of the best books i have read in a very long time i felt like this story could have been about me because i grew up in the same area and in the same situation described in the pages of this story the author did such an excellent job of making you feel each narrator's perspective of what was happening but the character i felt such empathy for was the nine year old boy his viewpoint was the most heart wrenching because really he was the most affected by the events yet i felt he was pushed aside and being nine years old he didn't understand a lot of things that happened he just tried to be brave i wanted to pick him up and take him away from the whole mess and never let him go i grew up in the area this book was set in and in fact still live here the descriptions are true to form and sadly this kind of thing still goes on i know because i have been there and like adelaide who was so like my grandmother i believe people can heal after they have been broken and can change and become something different than they were before","157":"a good first novel this story is a struggle between evil and good and life of innocence children living on the battlefield this is story of young innocence mountain healers old men holding grudges couples drifting apart evil preachers snakes and wayward spouses at times i got lost in the story due to the dialogue at other times i got confused with the characters now some or all of this may be my problem i read the novel in in many short spurts rather than a few long sessions i would not remember what i had previously read all that aside this is a very good read it verges on being a theological read it would be a good efm supplemental read","158":"i loved this book for the setting in western nc of course and it did take me back to reading to kill a mockingbird the p s paperback edition includes statements from the author about what inspired the story a black church in chicago rewritten as a pentecostal church in southern appalachia not sure about that but it was believable","159":"best book i have read in a long time one of the reasons i bought it was a review on the cover that said it's as if cormac mccarthy wrote to kill a mockingbird both favorites of mine","160":"i really liked the writing style and the story was engaging i'll be looking for more from this author","161":"lit sojourngreat characters","162":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here meh i felt as if the telling of the story took away from the drama we know the preacher had killed before we knew why he was upset with stump we knew stump was dead and how he was killed so while each character tells their side of the story very few things are revealed the main problem i think was that we have no idea 1 what the preacher's actual deal was and 2 why on earth a god fearing married woman would bang the preacher in the first place plus and evil southern preacher is s meh i felt as if the telling of the story took away from the drama we know the preacher had killed before we knew why he was upset with stump we knew stump was dead and how he was killed so while each character tells their side of the story very few things are revealed the main problem i think was that we have no idea 1 what the preacher's actual deal was and 2 why on earth a god fearing married woman would bang the preacher in the first place plus and evil southern preacher is such a stereotype the book was fine but ultimately meh i'm hiding this review because of spoilers but basically the whole review is a spoiler more","163":"well written american tragedy","164":" a land more kind than home is a well constructed story where almost all of the parts fit together there are just a few characters and the action takes place in less than a week in a small town in western north carolina two brothers snoop a little too much on grown up activities and their world is irrevocably changed the story quickly heats up and no one can stop it the plotting language and characterization are so good that they will spoil you and lesser reads will be a disappointment the author wiley cash has set a high standard for himself in this first book","165":"interesting and unique story i found it a real page turner","166":"this is told in a southern voice which i normally don't care for but this book took me in i loved all the voices adelaide the town midwife jess the 9 yo boy who wants to protect his older mute brother and most particularly clem the town sheriff the ending was a bit predictable but it was so well told that i stayed engaged right until the end excellent writing makes it hard to believe that this a debut novel","167":"it is my understanding this is a first novel i think the writer shows alot of promise he tells an interesting story captures the feel of his location rural nc mountains has a good sense of pacing reveals the plot details regularly enough to keep ones interest but slowly enough to sustain the suspense the writers weakness was the format he chose the story switches between three characters points of view but the voices are not very distinct rather this technique was just a device to delay revealing the plot points otherwise good read","168":"mesmerizing lyrical magnificent can't recommend this book highly enough","169":"listening to this book on audible during a long commute or two made me appreciate the beautifully written story of a boy in a southern town i might have sped my way through the plot if i was reading this and missed a lot the story was full of humanity from the light and strength of ordinary people to the dark hiding within each of us if i had read it i might have gone with three stars but by appreciating the compelling writing i needed to give it four","170":"this is wiley cash's first novel and i'm excited to have a new southern author to follow","171":"i was hooked from the first page and read this straight through but be prepared for tragedy overload wiley cash has packed a lot of story and created vibrant characters in just 300 pages","172":" this was a pretty decent book i find myself fascinated by appalachian culture and this didn't disappoint the funny thing was is i kept thinking i was reading a book that took place in the 1800s or early 1900s but then i kept getting reminded that it took place in the mid 1980s though it's never said explicitly you can do a little math with one of the older characters when she mentions that she was 14 in 1919 so i found that interesting but also made it a bit hard for me to keep things straight i like to picture things in my mind and i kept picturing scenes as more old fashioned than they probably should have been until i reminded myself that i had to update it it is a tragedy of epic proportions so be prepared for that though it's well written and i really liked the tone of all three narrators though the sheriff was my least favorite but i found that the style of the three narrators really helped see the story from multiple angles and also gave me a chance to get to know more of the townspeople on a deeper level when they told more of their stories i liked how all the characters were written and especially the grandfather for some reason the timeline did jump around some which i found a bit confusing but not too bad and not nearly as much as my ongoing issue with trying to place the characters further back in time is this a good book yes especially if you like tragedies and or books set in appalachia was it great eh i don't think so but i did definitely like it","173":"good hearted simple storythis was the first book i had read by this author it had a good flow and i enjoyed the story line but there were times where it drug out for a while it does capture the essence of a small town and brings to light the truth about what can happen in them too i liked that each chapter was written from a different character therefore giving you a different perspective","174":"this is a guy to watch even the tragedy of the story on so many levels could not prevent me from being sorry when it was over he's that good","175":"i didn't even finish it wasn't my cup of tea and i'm usually ocd and i always have to finish a book once i start no matter how much i don't like it i was disappointed i thought i would be a good read and that i wouldn't be able to put it down","176":"enjoyable read stock characters","177":"very engaging book it made me sad and angry and uncomfortable as well it should","178":"this is by far one of the best books that i have ever read i loved every page and found myself crying at the ending","179":"this was a wonderful book told from the perspective of a young boy an old woman and a sheriff involving the death of the boy's mute brother in church it's a study of evil in the form of the church pastor and the transgressions of the boy's mother i got really involved in the lives of these people and loved the western north carolina setting this was the author's debut book and i will look forward to any subsequent books by this true talent","180":" authentic dialogue should always be phonetically accurate but wiley cash goes one further by making his prose phonetic too initially this grated on me cash's felonies against good grammar like pinpricks to my stickler's soul after a few chapters however i began to hear the story unfold in a southern american accent i presume that wiley cash knows correct english but broke the rules deliberately in order to tell his tale with a quintessentially american voice this presumption allowed me to overlook the book's grammatical vandalism and enjoy its story which has multi faceted appeal when a young autistic boy suffers a horrific fate at the hands of a minister with a dark past the event has long rippling consequences each chapter is narrated by a different character in this way cash paints a complete picture of the book's microcosm detailing pertinent events surrounding the autistic child's death cash's writing style is minimalist never flashy this suits the story antagonists are myriad faith versus knowledge forgiveness versus stubborn grudge holding adult delusion versus innate wisdom of children family versus church control by external entities versus self control and personal autonomy 'a land more kind than home' showcases accomplished storytelling and masterful tension building it is a slow burning echo chamber of fear faith and fortitude a true american tale highly recommended","181":"this book captured my heart the characters were very real","182":"i liked the alternating viewpoints and the north carolina setting i kept comparing this to crooked letter crooked letter and found i cared much less about these characters some nice moments but a very tidy ending","183":"it was a pretty good read i liked the story but wished the ending was a little more satisfying something more grandiose it was really good for a first novel by that author","184":"i soaked in every word of this book told from the minds of an old southern christian woman the county sheriff and a wide eyed boy who saw something he should have i am going to read wiley cash","185":"really great the review reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's to kill a mockingbird is pretty spot on quick read","186":"this novel is amazing i loved the scarey parts when the lunatic pastor shoves and holds adelaide's arm into that snake box the poignant parts when jimmy comes to take care of jess and all parts in between wiley cash captures the appalachain mountain culture as no outsider could i hope another novel of his follows soon we may have another pat conroy on our hands","187":"i listened to this and loved it the performance was one of the best i've heard bringing the characters to live","188":"this is a wonderful book by a great new author i highly recommend it","189":"there are beautifully evocative descriptions of the southern setting and i loved seeing references to where i grew up in western nc the overall story is intriguing and i liked how we slowly learn more about the characters especially through the perspectives of the different narrators each of which seem genuine and well written although adelaide was perhaps my least favorite i'll definitely look forward to more by wiley cash","190":"i'd really give this more like 3 5 stars great writing and use of atmosphere and place but the plot trudged along for about the first half of the book the character development was also a little weak overall though it was a good read and i would read another novel by this author","191":" this story of the fight between good and evil in a church and in the people connected by that church is told by three characters who are both observers and participants in the events adelaide leaves the church and takes the children with her when the new pastor chambliss covers the windows in newspapers and brings snake handling to the congregation jess is a nine year old boy whose mother is a part of the church and whose brother christopher gets caught in the middle of the battle for souls and clem the sheriff has known the town and its inhabitants for over 20 years but is still seen as an outsider adelaide is a confirmed church goer who begins to question her church but not her faith as chambliss brings his charismatic influence to bear upon the small town in north carolina when a woman dies after handling a snake at church and the cause of her death is covered up by chambliss and the church elders adelaide takes the children from the church and ministers to them separately one of those children is a mute boy christopher whose church going mother wants a miracle while his church avoiding father does not believe in miracles it is this difference in belief that provides the background for a battle between adelaide and chambliss and in the end results in tragedy for all of the family the characterization in this book is some of the strongest i've ever read the three characters' voices provide windows into their lives and thoughts while at the same time telling the story of powerful events taking place in the small backwoods north carolina town as we come to know these three their insights into the main characters involved in the events bring those characters to life as well this book won the 2012 cwa new blood dagger award so it is clearly identified as a mystery yes there is death in it and suspense but i found it to be more of a classic southern novel of human tragedy it is a strong indictment of religious fanaticism at the same time that it celebrates the transcendent nature of human hope and kindness this is a book whether one views it as a mystery or not that holds its own against the literature of other great authors like faulkner","192":"great read a journey through hurt and healing highly recommend","193":" a land more kind than home has a good story and i enjoyed the way that story was told by three different narrators all three had very distinctive voices and each told a piece of the story that means that the reader knows more than the narrators most of the time which worked well in this book one narrator is 9 year old jess whose brother stump is mute and whose parents are no longer happily married jess's mother has joined a local church led by mysterious charismatic and possibly evil preacher chambliss then stump dies in the church jess's chapters stay pretty focused in a young boy's perspective and are often heartbreaking as he struggles to understand what is happening around him the local midwife is also a narrator and from her perspective we learn more about the pastor and the church and also more about jess's parents things he is too young to see as the eldest of the narrators she also provides a sense of history and place with her stories of days gone by the final narrator is the sheriff who has always been suspicious of the pastor when stump dies the sheriff investigates even as the death brings up memories of his own past this is a sad moody atmospheric story of just how difficult life can sometimes be none of the characters are entirely innocent and the ending probably doesn't make anyone happy but the people and place ring true","194":"like watching a couple of mild episodes of justified","195":" 'death is to find a land more kind than home ' thomas wolfewhat do you get when you mix together the year 1986 boys being boys an evil pentecostal pastor the hills and dark hollers of north carolina a righteous sheriff and a scared midwife you get the debut novel a land more kind than home by wiley cash the story is told in three voices adelaide lyle the elderly midwife protector of the children she's delivered over the years jess hall nine year old boy who loves his parents and his older brother stump who is non verbal and autistic and who are all major characters in this tale and then there is clem barefield sheriff and a man of integrity with painful memories of his past the river road church of christ in signs following plays a major role in the story also foursquare gospel pentecostal with all the trappings faith healings speaking in tongues snake handling other spiritual gifts led by sociopathic pastor carson chambliss and the story starts builds and culminates in tragedy because jess and stump two curious young boys see something they shouldn't and start a landslide of tragic events cash has quite a knack with drawing utterly believable characters who use stunningly spare but effective dialogue drawing the reader sometimes unwillingly deeply into this tragic story i was surprised by this book i did not expect the high quality of writing in this first effort by cash or my gut response to the story it brought to mind the last child by john hart a painted house by john grisham and the bottoms and edge of dark water both by joe lansdale high praise indeed from me since lansdale is one of my favorite authors can you tell i liked this book a lot","196":"a dark look into southern religion","197":"excellent loved this book so much brilliant debut novel that brought the people and the landscape to life almost felt like a movie as it was so vivid","198":"nc based good read","199":"almost went with 3 stars i was disappointed in the book it began really well i was impressed with wiley cash at his sylva booksigning most reviews were good but i particularly didn't like the way the story ended beyond that our book club agreed that it would have been better if adelaide's last section had been omitted it added nothing to the last lines given in clem's section preceding it","200":" wiley cash wisely focuses his first novel on one terrible event the botched faith healing of a mute boy stump and its immediate aftermath by concentrating most of the narrative on the actions taken over a few days cash creates an economical story and a quick enjoyable read as you can see from the star rating i quite liked the book however most of my comments are going to be on what i see as the book's weaknesses the story is told by three interesting characters but cash has some difficulty pinning down their individual voices which is to say that sometimes the boy jess sounds like the sheriff clem and the sheriff sounds like the old lady adelaide this problem disappears in the actual dialogue they certainly speak differently but their narrative voices need to be a bit more distinguished most of the first half of the book leads up to and deals very well with the central action of the book and its immediate consequences following that though we end up with a large amount of back story which while not unconnected takes away from the immediacy of the novel which is one of its key strengths none of these back stories are poorly written or uninteresting some of them are fascinating but i can't help but wonder if the novel would be stronger as a whole if a few of them were dropped to keep the narrative more fully in the present cash is quite good at making the seemingly normal characters fully fleshed out and interesting jess's father and grandfather for instance seem like fairly unimportant characters if only because they aren't given a narrative voice of their own but within the limited confines of the short novel cash gives each of them a compelling life of his own if there's a weakness in characterization though it's with the female characters adelaide is an interesting character but her relationship with god with religion isn't fully expressed and it should be central to her character jess's mother on the other hand is at the centre of the story and has virtually no character to speak of but if i'm dwelling on what i see as the book's faults it's probably because i've enjoyed it so much i've been pretty disappointed in every new book by a new voice i've recently read here cash delivers the goods cash's knowledge of the setting really adds to the novel as does his real life experience with fundamentalists and faith healers and at the centre of it all is the figure of carson chambliss a truly memorable antagonist and one of the more evocative characters of recent fiction finally here's a new author to follow","201":"enjoyed reading about an area of the country that i pass on the way to our summer home","202":"good first novel hoping i get to hear him speak since he resides in morgantown","203":" i totally enjoyed this book it grabbed me at the very beginning and i just didn't want to top reading which is why i completed it in less than 2 days the book is complex in theme but love family and church are all there they are not all necessarily healthy relationships but they are there the book is well written with vivid characters each main character had a part of the book written in first person and it was good to see the events from different viewpoints did i love the ending no did i even like the ending i'm not sure but the book gave a lot to the concept that healing is possible i recommend this book","204":"how too much of the wrong religion can destroy a family","205":" a land more kind than home is a literary thriller which is the best kind of thriller plus it is told by three different characters which gives the reader a more rounded story they see it from three perspectives also although the main character jess is a child at the time the events of the book take place the reader isn't subjected to only a child's view throughout the book more about the parts of a land more kind than home that are told by jess although he is a child at the time of the story i determined that he is now in his 40s yet he talks like a kid and not only in quotations this is a device many authors use to describe events that a child experiences it's maddening as for its being a thriller it is but not much it's pretty predictable other aggravations that are probably nitpicky is it really true that everyone in western north carolina has such atrocious grammar this book is written as if no one there ever leaves the same people were born and grew up there and they still live there as adults the publisher's description of this book compares the author wiley cash to john hart but that's not fair this book is good but it's not great hart's books are","206":"this is a terrific story the three narrators will stay with me for quite a while","207":"enjoyed the storytelling by three narrators in the first person although at times i wanted to learn more about the other characters many of whom remained mysterious thought the author captured the language and place of western nc very well","208":" i am a fan of southern stories so was excited to find this book to read on my library's e book shelf think william faulkner harper lee or olive ann burns layers of emotions and gripping events told by three different narrators jess witnesses a terrible scene involving his brother who is mute and his mother inside a snake handling fanatical church the pastor holds an iron grip of fear on his church members and jess's dad is unaware of nearly all that is swirling around beneath the surface how can a nine year old handle his secrets as the reader is swept along in the story the darkness and suspense of the tale hold on tight and only after the terrible conclusion is one free to work out the amazing resilience of jess i started it this morning and didn't stop till the end not very many books can hold my attention that tightly good read","209":"wiley creates characters who are down home and real wiley weaves a plot that takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride","210":"i have to say that i was disappointed in this book i think my expectations were just too high after reading some of the reviews the author is very descriptive and that's nice in most cases however he tends to go on and on at times","211":"halfway through i was ready to give it five stars but then it started to drag and i was finding some developments hard to swallow it ended predictably","212":"really a 3 5","213":"heard him read last night at flyleaf first chapter very powerful stuff","214":"wonderful first effort by wiley cash the story was deftly told from the perspective of three very diverse characters","215":"the choice and characterization of narrators was strong and cash did an excellent job with slowly interweaving their backstories to increase the emotional resonance of his plot that depth and nuance in the treatment of the narrators also however emphasized how superficially he portrayed chambliss let alone the charisma and draw of the church itself","216":"this book reminds me of whom also won the dagger award though the different voices in this book is well written i felt it wasn't compelling as tom franklen","217":"the author's writing style is amazing you almost feel as though you're immersed in this small appalachian town i was swept up in the story as well being curious to know what was going on behind the closed doors and covered windows of the church outside of town the snake handling preacher doesn't want anyone to know either he has such power over his congregation that no one will talk until one fateful night when something goes very wrong and things start to unravel","218":"if steinbeck harper lee and cormac mccarthy all sat down together to write a book i feel this easily could have been the outcome a simply put yet dark and moving tale of americana","219":"my review here http smallworldreads blogspot com 2 in brief this is the story of nine year old jess and how his family fell apart--how he lost everything at the hands of one evil man disguised as a pastor it's also the story of love gone awry selfishness and sacrifice children lost revenge and forgiveness and redemption","220":"tender poignant and gripping one of those books you feel as you read i will be watching for more from this first time author","221":"a tragedy rather hopeless not as suspenseful as billed good writing good character development for some of the players but not all including the mother wife chilling snake handling scenes at hand of a very dark character","222":" this was a very good very atmospheric novel about a tiny town in north carolina and the bad people you can find sometimes in small towns sort of like a especially tight non horror stephen king book with three compelling characters as narrators a bit of suspense too you know right from go that things aren't going to end well but you're not sure for whom or how recommended especially if you've been thinking about how you need a novel that reads like the south in summer slow but hot with some sweat","223":"i read this in july 2012 for a group read the review below is the one i posted in the thread back then finished 4 5 stars i read this book in two days it was an engrossing and quick read however it wasn't a light read but a story as dark as the hollers in the hills around the town as dark as the evil that was the soul of the preacher carson chambliss it is this evil and how it affects the elderly midwife adelaide the young boy jess and his mute older brother christopher and the town's sheriff clem that drives the story to its awful conclusion the facts of the story are told by adelaide jess and clem in alternating sections of the book this is not hard to follow since the author presents each character's viewpoint so well along the way we also learn of their back stories which really allows the reader to see the events through their eyes this was a really great read","224":"3 5 there were some definite strong parts story told from the perspective of three characters 2 of the 3 were not developed as fully as i would have liked","225":"another wonderful book by a first time author good follow up to heading out to wonderful","226":"a recommended read wiley cash's debut novel a land more kind than home is a spectacular and powerful story that brings life in rural north carolina to vibrantly to life set in the 1980s it is an profound tale of dark secrets a charismatic evangelical minister and the evil that is sometimes wrought in the name of religion to read my review in its entirety please visit http www bookreviewsandmorebykathy","227":"good storytelling interesting choices as far as narrative points of view i wasn't wholly gripped by the story though the pace was a scosh sluggish and the youngest narrator's penchant for describing the most mundane details wore me out otherwise who can say no to a cast of wicked preachers flawed lawmen cursed families and wise old community matriarchs it's a solid book with a satisfying end","228":"a strong debut novel by wiley cash good writing however the characters are not highly developed and i had difficulty embracing any of the main characters it is a tragic novel of a small community in the mountains of north carolina a preacher is the central figure and he is anything but god like the preacher takes advantage of his congregation and several people die as a result don't read this book if you are looking for something to brighten your spirits","229":" first book i'm giving a c rating i listened to it via audible com and i think thats what messed it up for me i ended up increasing the narrator speed to 2 times the normal amount its narrated by 3 people the town midwife a 9 year old boy and the sheriff the book moves rather slowly and the only thing that kept my interest was finding out what happens to two of the main characters the pastor and the mom i cannot really tell what the purpose of the book was there was no real climax just seemingly smaller versions of one if you like snakes churches and small town stories this one's for you","230":"i really enjoyed this book although it took me a couple of tries to get into it i think that was more me than the book though maybe it was the title and the southern setting but i kept envisioning tommy lee jones as the sheriff","231":"well written but i didn't find myself feeling any warm feelings for the characters with the exception of one characters the sheriff the rest of the characters remained static throughout the novel","232":"wiley cash's first novel is a blockbuster of a book so beautifully written and constructed it's an incredible read it was only toward the very end that i figured out what was going to happen and only then did i realize that there was really no other possible ending this is a book to deconstruct to see what makes this novel work so incredibly well to see what exactly it is in cash's down to earth poetic uncomplicated writing that propels us forward throughout the book bravo","233":"well written and i always enjoy a story that's told in differing views by more than one protagonist however in my opinion it really didn't do the subject of abuse of power in religion and the effect that it has on people justice it didn't delve into it as deeply as it could have","234":" a land more kind than home has it all it is a fast read but well written the book has well developed characters with a villain that makes your skin crawl and other characters that are very human who may be well meaning but can do great harm the story is told through the voice of three characters jess a boy of 9 adelaide lyle a strong old woman and the town sheriff the setting is near asheville north carolina in the 80's when a new supposed pastor opens up a church in a small town most of the townspeople are mesmerized by his way with snakes and his promise of coming to the lord but the three voices in the book soon learn that there is real evil here great book club choice","235":"i would give this book 3 5 stars i liked it but didn't love it i was initially annoyed by the folksy way the characters spoke to one another but that seemed to fade into the background as the story progressed good writing and characters but i wanted more from it i think i wanted more in depth analysis of a few of the characters rather than what seemed to be a more superficial glance at many characters","236":"a marvelous first novel whose theme is how a sickness in society can damage both a small town and the individuals in it told through three characters you understanding of the malize is enhance by an 80 year old midwife a sheriff in his fifties who is an outsider and an eight year old boy all three characters are beacons of character and the evil is gripping but the destruction is horrible the ending leaves a small crack of hope i highly recommend i stayed up late two nights to finish because i did not want to put it down","237":"hauntingly beautiful the characters are so real that you feel them","238":"this was an entertaining tale set in the western north carolina mountains in the late 1970s it is written in such a straight forward easy going manner that the author could just as well be sitting in your living room telling you this story cash is a minimalist on detail and is conservative with his word count simplistic and direct you won't need to look up a single word in the dictionary while you're reading and if you are a quick reader this one can be done in a day or two although told in the voices of three different characters it still flows like a single narrator might be talking and the southern dialect is smooth and comfortable the story itself reads like something you might hear about on your local news one of those odd happenings that seem just too crazy to be real and might leave the news anchors saying we can't make this stuff up but cash can and did make this stuff up it is gripping right from the beginning think about john grisham's the client in the first chapter where those two little boys witness the man committing suicide in his car out in the woods do you remember that well this opens like that not exactly like that but you'll feel the same way cash starts out strong and builds the story and it has a very compelling first half however somewhere in the middle it loses its focus and tends to wander with the backstories of some of the characters with the initial action being so strong i was left feeling impatient having to read through adelaide's and clem's stories to get back to jess's predicament without spoiling the story i have to say that i was disappointed in the book overall it did stir feelings of anger toward the mother frustration with miss lyle sympathy for ben hall and maternally protective feelings for jess i think however that i would have probably rated the book higher had it not been so overhyped in the marketing reviews comparisons to to kill a mockingbird and praise from other southern authors whom i greatly respect made me want to read this right away afterwards i find that the book is good but not that good so read it and enjoy it but don't set your expectations based on what other people say","239":"haunting couldn't put it down","240":"loved the language loved the different voices","241":"narrated by jess a 9 year old boy adelaide an old midwife and clem the town sheriff this story was impossible for me to put down once i started it set in the hills of north carolina stump jess's older mute brother witnesses something that threatens their mom and the town preacher i loved all the characters in this book i also loved the quote at the beginning of the book death is to lose the earth you know for greater knowing to lose the life you have for greater life to leave the friends you loved for greater loving to find a land more kind than home more large than earth which was written by thomas wolfe","242":"a beautifully written book about a tragic crime in rural north carolina the story is told by several characters each moving the story forward with their respective perspectives clearly evident characters are deep sympathetic and genuine cash draws the reader in quickly and portrays the setting so well that the reader is there i hope cash has many more such books in his future","243":" a pretty good book for a first novel there are a lot of books written with western north carolina for a background i live exactly where this book is written so the references to towns landmarks etc are always distracting as they were here i noticed that he didn't cite anyone local in his acknowledgements which makes me wonder the places he references are accurate however the small church is where he places it but it certainly is not how he portrays it i wonder if the folks that attend that church are somewhat miffed","244":"the author chose the perfect three narrators a sheriff an elderly lady and a child it's a great narrative about southern small time life the characters are well developed from the crazy pastor chambliss to the brothers stump and jess the novel is well written but i found the ending too contrived","245":"i loved this book it pulled me through i could barely stand to put it down it was tragic but so genuine and heartfelt highly recommended","246":"i thought this was well written i liked the way it was told from the perspective of different well developed and likeable characters but it was far too sad and depressing the little bit of hope at the end wasn't enough","247":"picked it up because the cover description was reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's to kill a mockingbird good book","248":"very well written and quite a different story about two brothers and a strange church community in noth carolina","249":"slow as holler molasses grazed the surface of southern religion u0026amp snake handling but left me unsatisfied with its simplistic long winded narrative painful","250":"the author was a student of ernest j gaines and although he states that of love and dust inspired him when he wrote this book it also reminded me of a gathering of old men in how it is told from one character's pov to the next genuinely enjoyed this","251":" the story opens with two young boys sneaking a peek through a window like these boys who witness an event they don't understand the reader is brought into a world of secrets and mystery where people speak in riddles and it's difficult to know who you can trust although this story takes place in the mid 1980's in a small north carolina town it has all the elements of a shakespearean tragedy brotherly love parental love betrayal and good versus evil this debut novel by wiley cash is a page turner reading this book is like watching a train wreck in slow motion early in the story it's evident that there will be great damage to many as the events play out to cash's credit there is a level of tension throughout the book as the story is revealed through the eyes of four different characters","252":"an emotional story about the effects an extreme snake handling evangelic preacher has on a small appalachian community in the 1980's it is told in multiple perspectives of an older female church member a young boy and the local sheriff the story is sometimes a bit convoluted between the foretelling and the flashbacks but overall it is very good and very sad i listened to this on audio and probably would've preferred the print version the reader for the young boy perspective has a man's voice but uses youthful inflections it was off putting","253":" so this year i'm resolved to be more mindful and thoughtful about the stories i put in my brain and to try to do the authors whose work i am so grateful and desperate the thing due them by thinking about what they've created i'm a little bit rusty at putting thoughts to screen like this so all apologies to mr cash this is going to be bumpy which is a little ironic as i think of it because the language of a land more kind than home is the true opposite of bumpy it's smooth as honey smooth as a glassy summer river and as full underneath with murk and ruthless undercurrents and bones i got the book on the recommendation of a coworker who heard me bemoaning the serious reading ahedonia i was experiencing and promised me that i would fall in love with this book on language alone and my if mark wasn't right the first page and i was hooked on the rich languge and wanted to follow wherever those words led like following the most perfect fiddle and guitar folk ballad and like any ballad worth the name this novel is utter utter heartbreak beautifully hauntingly told utter heartbreak at it's most basic level this is the story of how a young autistic boy christopher to his mother stump to everyone else dies at the hands of a charismatic preacher in a small town church in rural north carolina and what the immediate consequences of that death are for his mother his father his younger left behind brother and the preacher himself i don't feel too bad telling you that because every book review tells you that the book cover tells you that and even in absence of those things you'll know that in the first three paragraphs of the book it's not stated outright that way but you'll know something awful has happened and the book isn't about finding out what that awful thing is so i'll just tell you so you can brace yourself stump dies and it's awful the novel has a far far more beautiful and honest and devestating aim than being a basic thriller it's much more about how three minds talk to themselves about stumps death how any given people try to make sense of something fundementally evil these particular three souls form the narration of the story adelaide lyle the town midwife wise woman and functional memory jess stumps' little brother and clem barfield the sheriff of marshall the tiny town where the events unfold the novel is a gentle braid of their voices as they meander back and forth back into the general and personal histories leading up to the tragedy of stumps death the death itself as they each experience it and the aftermath and while the three interact essentially they are not telling the story to each other or even really to you or i these are three voices talking to themselves referencing things outside of the immediate view of the reader ruminating and repeating themselves wandering exactly as the mind does circling around and picking at a story too awful to tell too powerful to pull away from so too the narrators beginning with adelaide try to confront the story and then end up sliding away getting distracted searching out underlying causes roots of the tragedy if stump is the innocent victim carson chambliss the charasmatic preacher is the personification of evil in this book of all the characters his is the central object of fascination introduced by adelaide in the first chapter we learn of his face and arms horrifically scarred by a fire in some unknown corner of his mysterious past we learn of how he papered up the windows of his storefront church so that no outsiders could look in and see what was going on we learn how the somber baptist congregation that he discovered years back have somehow been led by him to embrace snake handling and speaking in tongues and how there have been mysterious deaths in the past and how those deaths somehow only seemed to strengthen his power you learn straight off that he scares adelaide and you get the sense she is not a woman whose gone through her life easily scared and you get the feeling that the central mystery of the book is not what happened to stump but rather what happened to carson the novel deals with this on multiple multiple levels and many of them seem to get at some deeper long standing argument about faith and destiny and personal responsibility and communal responsibility that our culture seems to be playing out did the tragedy come about because as clem the sheriff observes some folks take to religion almost like it were a drug like it feeds them and that from that place they hold onto that religion despite the damage they are doing to their lives did it come as adelaide suggests because people moved away from the basic simplicity of the true religion the religion of humility and looking after one's neighbor and faith in god's providence to an edgier darker place of passion and danger or did the tragedy come about because as adelaide later tells us stumps' daddy and momma turned away from the old fashioned way of relying of the wisdom of the land to tend to and nurture themselves and their families and with that kind of wild pride open the door to subsequent tragedies is the fault in the never mentioned but constantly observed devestation of poverty the pinch of hunger the humiliation of grovelling and making due that strains families and opens up cracks that turn big enough to swallow all sense and faithfulness is it the fault of jess and stump who saw something they shouldn't have and subsequently were punished is it the fault of adelaide who knew enough to take the children out of the church years prior but stopped just short of getting the law involved when she might have potentially changing the course of events none of the narrators ever come up with an answer that truly satisfies them and reading the novel i was left only with questions of my own what is the line between a faith that is nourishing and abiding and a faith that is seductively destructive or the dividing line between holiness and insanity what is the difference between being on fire with the holy spirit and being on fire with lust for power how do you explain otherwise impossible miracles that happen to horrible horrible people are patterns in families of alcholism of abuse of all manner of family demons destined to be repeated must blood always call for blood can we be satisfied without vengeance when something terrible has happened can a story be stopped mid stream or must it play out to some awful conclusion the novel isn't all devestation alongside the rending and chaos there are moments of gentleness an estranged grandfather teaching his grandson to roast hotdogs over an open fire an old woman trudging up a mountainside in a blizzard to help a young family in need a mother making a quiet box for her troubled son mr cash's brilliance as a writer for me lay in his depiction of the most basic and simple almost throwaway moments of everyday life right along side the most baffling and profound it's difficult to do that to put the mundane along with the sacred and the profane but mr cash does that and let's us make of that what we will","254":"very well written debut novel for wiley cash tragic but i couldn't put it down","255":"3 5 stars love the setting but the back and forth between the characters got just a bit challenging for me","256":"extremely well written surprised it is his first novel the storyline is very compelling and the characters are rich and realistic i was somewhat disappointed by the ending but will continue to read cash's works would add another 1 2 star if technically possible","257":"book club selection it is an engrossing story","258":" i received this advance reader's copy arc through bookbrowse i finished this book and i must say i am spellbound i knew it was going to be a good read right from the cover but once i read the first chapter of 22 pages i knew this one was an exceptional read and one that won't let me escape its grip until the very last page the author is a fine storyteller and his book will be found in many book clubs to be sure do yourself a favor and read this book it's a must read and a story that i will not soon forget","259":"this was a little too slow for me i seem to be on this roll lately the story was interesting though and i like the narrators it was very sad though so many preventable tragedies i guess that's like real life though","260":"well written beautiful prose a maddening story i'm not sure i needed to know","261":"one of the most interesting and different books i've read","262":" this book was well written but it is one of those stories that takes a slice of time from someone's life and you kind of get to the end and wonder what happened after that slice of time this is a southern tale about a holy rolling church which uses snakes and poison for healings which ultimately results in more than one death the characters were believable and the book had good imagery i found some of jess's reactions to be less than believable but overall this was a good tale and the first time author shows great promise","263":"very good the writing reminded me of ron rash a new young author to watch","264":"incredible characters in a story wonderfully told make this a must read for fiction fans kept the pages turning with his ear for dialogue and ability to lead you right into the heart of darkness","265":"i'll give wiley cash 2 stars just for writing a book although it's not a book i enjoyed it was really quite depressing kind of is that all there is i would have liked to see more character development i didn't like the drawl which might just be me the grandfather turned out to be the only redeemable point to the book and that's not saying much this was cash's first novel perhaps his others are better as the author's first is rarely his best","266":"very well written the story was grim but the characters were so believable and the descriptions were so good that i felt i was actually there i could not put this book down","267":"this book should come with a warning do not read at bedtime innocence vs evil blind faith vs reason and above all fear are the elements woven throughout the novel wiley cash writes with a strong regional voice i felt as if i were sitting beside each narrator as he explained his role this isn't a book i'll forget reread in 2013 for book group discussion","268":"with great dialogue and insight the author presents a rural southern town whose people become enthralled by a newcomer preacher whose unorthodox church practices lead to a tragedy one woman who has pulled herself away from the preacher's influence helps unravel the mystery","269":"wow what a debut novel i really enjoyed this book i've read a few now that covers events and written through different key characters eyes this truly is a book about a land that's more kind than home","270":"loved this book beautifully written and narrated by 3 people involved in the story the young boy's voice is the strongest and most poignant having lived in the south it was all believable to me a great read would be good for book clubs","271":" having lived in the south in the early 90's i had no trouble understanding the dynamic between this hot shot pastor and the people of this small town they are looking for something to believe in and he brings a false promise of hope and salvation as the narrative moves between three different voices we all agreed in bookgroup there was one missing that of julie the mother how could she allow such things to happen what led her to do so sadly most of them are on their own quest for redemption a quest unfulfilled","272":"review to come","273":"this book was pretty well done although the subject matter wasn't uplifting by any means it was a good portrayal of a different side of life and the bleakness of it sometimes and i guess there was some hope in some of the relationships that were able to be transformed thru generations bringing hope to the younger boy and his future","274":"this is so well done i loved the story and the character development i am hoping there will be more books to follow wiley cash did a wonderful job of writing this novel thanks for coming to southern voices it was a joy to hear you speak","275":"a great read and one i couldn't put down i found the story and the characters gripping the three narrators jess adelaide and clem were all relatable and i found myself connected to each of their stories i was invested in the book through each chapter but by the last few pages i had tears in my eyes i only wish i knew more about what happened next particularly for little jess","276":" the professional reviews shock me the only explanation i can think of is editors want only good happy reviews needless to say i did not think the book lived up to the hype certainly cash is a good story teller and he has an ear for appalachian dialect but he makes a number of mistakes most first time writers make first what should have been a coming of age story becomes a horror story because josh the young boy is never given an opportunity to overcome his tragedy and learn and grow from it instead the story abruptly ends with a little boy losing everything in his life there is no recovery no opportunity for josh to absorb it to transition from childhood to adulthood second we are never given an explanation for preacher chambliss' hypnotic control over his congregation it is demonstrated but never explained here we have a preacher so mesmerizing he can make his congregation risk their very lives proving their faith yet we never get a glimpse into a single parishioner's mind as to why the good preacher gains such complete control i guess we are supposed to accept that appalachian people would do such a thing for all the stereotypical reasons we usually attribute to them third a fair portion of this story is spent in flashbacks explaining how the main characters came to be where they are and who they are nothing new with that except the flashbacks occur at awkward moments in the story for example the sheriff is rushing to the scene of a death perhaps the pivotal moment in the story when all of a sudden page after page we are reliving the sheriff's past learning about his own tragedy quite an interruption to the flow fourth i never really care about any of the characters not even josh the nine year old boy they are all stereotypes shadows of more interesting characters i have met elsewhere they are as uninteresting as oatmeal i have nothing invested in them they are people i might pass on the road the author never gives me a reason to like or hold onto them i was disappointed because this story could have been so much better but what angered me were the reviews for the first time i thought reviewers were lying to me about the content of a book i'm not sure i can trust them any more i guess this is as good reason as any to check books out of the library before deciding to purchase good thing that is what i did one more thing i do see great potential in cash i would not hesitate to read his next book despite the problems with this one i see the seeds of a great storyteller in this one","277":"the consensus from my book club is a moratorium on books involving snakes and settings of the nc mountains","278":"a true southern gothic tale well wrtten and hard to put down cash's descriptions of north carolina its places and people combined with a story that grabbed you and kept you turning the pages i look forwad to his next book and highly recommend this one","279":"4 5 i really enjoyed this book the story telling was great each person's point of view was excellent my only issue was the end while the events made sense the resolution was quick and painless sort of for the antagonist i actually like people to be accused of their crimes and honestly julie was a weak self centered idiot not to give it away but really","280":"i loved this novel and read it in one day powerful novel with beautiful prose a strong narrative and a literary thriller all set in a small western north carolina town told through the voices of three distinct characters the reader is quickly pulled into a tragedy and reminded that sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between good and evil","281":"this was a great story very hard to put down looking forward to more novels from mr cash","282":"wow a modern greek tragedy i read this book in one 3 hour sitting because i couldn't put it down it meanders a bit and the flashback sequences are not clearly delineated yet i can't say it felt slow it did break my heart however i highly recommend this book","283":"just finished today wonderfully written novel i devoured it","284":"starts out strong but doesn't live up to its potential the story is told from three perspectives however only one of them adelaide lyle is a fleshed out personality and voice i especially found the character of jess hall hard to believe as a nine year old boy the voice is just too adult","285":"great book the voice of north carolina is so extremely well done there is just enough suspense to keep you going the characters are well drawn out and the book never stalls or disappoints good solid read","286":" i am often annoyed by the stale and badly drawn characters of contemporary southern fiction i read a land more kind than home because it has received positive reviews and is a first novel from a young author who is also a friend of my sister in law and a native of gastonia nc a town near my home the story is set in the southern appalachians with a plot immersed in the dark and deadly practice of snake handling does that even take place anywhere other than the south don't let those facts keep you from reading this book the story and characters are rich and compelling with well crafted scenes scents and flavors reminiscent of flannery o'connor and william faulkner i look forward to more novels from wiley cash","287":" this was a present from a goodreader so first of all thank you for the book eh it seems you have me all figured out with the corrupt church and its crooked leader of lemming parishioners the crushing poverty the substance abuse spurring from the crushing poverty combined with a consuming inability to forgive oneself for anything and the humans being nasty to one another for dumb reasons because they have no grasp of the world being larger than about 10 square miles my kinda storieees this is a tale of a psychopath and petty criminal who escapes from his sordid past to a teency stretch of north carolina backwoods and uses its hard up residents and their one church as his podium in order to fulfill all his megalomaniacal boyhood fantasies of being king shit of fuck mountain as if being considered a christ incarnate weren't enough he also just sorta likes how powerful he feels when he kills people and terrorizes old ladies i mean tests their faith with venomous snakes and smothering in front of his congregation oh and a commentary on religion emerges i should clarify that the pastor isn't exactly some serial killer and this isn't a slasher tale i don't think his numbers meet the definition at least not during the time which elapses in this book however given the limited cast in this story his meager death toll takes on the significance of mass murder i live in a town with something a bit over 100 000 residents and when someone dies here of unnatural causes pretty much everybody hears about it right away just imagine a community of maybe 100 people what a nightmare the idea of a town that small i mean and murder this story is less about him as formidable evil to be conquered though and more about the ricochet of horrible that his actions set into motion storied family histories will become more storied er still storms will rage shotguns will be fired secret sexytimes will be had bare knuckle abortions will be attempted and good ole moonshine will be dranked so much moonshine will be dranked this is a fast read in that it keeps tugging your squinty sleep eyes up to stay on task and it's pretty emotions prodding especially if you grew up poor and or with a drunken manic depressive father figure my petty complaints are two 1 though there are several narrators giving voice to a couple of handfuls of characters i was a bit put off by how similar they all sounded like almost identical having met a fair amount of rednecks and hillbillies in my day i assure you that there are a lot of different and equally nerve racking ways to sound like a blithering idiot then again i have never been to north carolina countryside or otherwise so i guess i don't actually know anything about that particular brand of verbal rot 2 the last page and a half almost cost a star i was totally behind the spearing of religion being used as a means of control and manipulation but the last portion being handed to the one devout narrator who's the good kind of religious zealot with her praise be the true lord and savior 'll heal us all in time mumbojumbo did not sit well to be fair though i have this knee jerk reaction to hyper religious talk where my eyes roll back in my head and i start right in with the lalululuuuuhh internal monologue and it's really not this book's fault that i'm a judgmental asshole it's my apostolic extended family's fault all their fault thank you eh i be loving you","288":"would probably give 3 5 stars love as always stories written in first person and this novel is written from the points of view of 3 people good writing with a nice feel for the language of the time and setting and distinct voices of the 3 narrators","289":"was alright","290":"find my review here http www catsandabook blogspot com","291":" this is a superb debut novel it was hard to put down some nights and i only did so when my eyes wouldn't stay open it is set in the author's beloved western north carolina in the mountains where religion and the bible have a strong influence on the mountain folk being told by three separate characters the author deftly weaves a story about a young boy's death and how it affects those close to him his characters and setting introduce the reader to a timeless mountain region rich with culture and awe inspiring landscapes this is definitely a must read","292":"i had such high hopes for this book because of the rave reviews i was disappointed the characters were all pretty much stereotypes and the story was pretty predictable lots of grief and tragedy but nothing really to be learned from it i can't believe it was compared to to kill a mockingbird someone in my book discussion group summed it up pretty well when she said she probably won't remember anything about it a week from now","293":"this was great literary thriller i think literature has gotten a little slap happy yes that's a technical term lol with the use of first person in fiction but in this instance hearing the voices of the three narrators served a purpose and reinforced the southern flavor of the book the prose was lyrical and well crafted the plot was also strong i notice some reviewers noted how the narrators occasionally veered off the plot to explain some back or side story under normal circumstances i would have found it annoying but again i thought it reinforced the idea of southern story telling which is never linear my only beef with the story was the ending it left a few questions about some characters that i can't talk about in this review without revealing the plot spoilers i would have liked those issues resolved by the ending but overall the book was strong i think it was closer to a 4 1 2 than a 5 star but i'd rather bump it up than down","294":"i loved this book it was not easy to read but it is all that a southern novel asks for and demands the voices of each character were true and clear and strong fully developed and involved in a tragic plot that i knew would end sadly from the beginning very well written","295":"love this genre as usual i must have had a past life in the south","296":"mr cash hit a home run with his first novel looking forward to reading future novels by him","297":"pretty good but so depressing it made me want to kill myself good writer","298":"this is the story of two brothers growing up in small town north carolina jess is the younger brother to christopher a mute and one day while spying they see something they shouldn't christopher is caught spying which turns out to be a catalyst that leads to his death due to their mother buying in to the local snake charming preachers ways the death crushes jess and his father but the boys mother appears to not have an interest in continuing to mother her children choosing instead to run off with the preacher who happens to be evil incarnate and possibly even a psychopath another fine example of people being led astray when they hunger for something more out of life this is a tough story to take and it will not be for everybody because a child dies for seeing something they should not","299":" beautiful prose but the story left a lot to be desired while the subject of religious snake handling is potentially fascinating and the characters voces were well drawn i don't feel the author delved deeply enough into the story itself he seemed to take an easy way out to wind up with a pat ending that was unsatisfying considering how much interest the subject setting and characters held for me i do expect great things from the author though he writes beautifully and has great empathy and compassion for the people he writes about","300":" this book blew me away i can't even begin to say how incredible this book was it's a rare occasion when i give a book five stars but this truly is one of those times the basic premise of the story is nothing new but how the author crafts the story makes it completely riveting i can't wait to read more from this author this book also contains some great quotes and exchanges why have you been gone so long because sometimes we do things we can't take back and we need to go away and leave folks alone and let them forget us for a while wow","301":"wonderfully written it's a tragic story and the ending isn't happy i couldn't put it down i started reading it last night and read myself to sleep i woke up at 4 a m and read until i finished cash is a truly great storyteller he reminds me of ron rash and john steinbeck two of my favorite authors i'm looking forward to his next book","302":"the story is nicely written and told with compassion and understanding but it felt thin the characters could have been more fleshed out and complex there's a lot of potential here and i wouldn't mind reading something by wiley cash again but this one didn't do it for me","303":"the voices in a land more kind than home are so captivating and vivid and liken the novel to to kill a mockingbird dark and tragic and compelling this is an incredible novel that i must highly recommend","304":"loved it i thought it was amazing and could not put it down","305":"it was just ok reviews said it was similar to a tom franklin novel maybe i shouldn't have had such high expectations","306":" as i read this i thought of conroy's prince of tides the plot is very different but the feeling for me was the same jess is the younger brother of stump real name christopher who is identified in the blurbage as being autistic but i don't think that's the case because he can interact with others he just doesn't speak is often in his own world and doesn't like being touched his mother belongs to a snake and fire handling church church of christ in signs following it's a church that miss lyle the 70 something town healer refuses to let the children attend his father ben is a former football star and son of a mean drunk i don't want to get into spoiler territory so i'll stop there the characters are strongly drawn their stories equally so there is a great deal of flashback going on but the life of these people in hollers and small towns makes that backwards glance worth while it would not have been as interesting a story had it been told in chronological order and the central story needs the additional information this is set in the 1980s so the sheriff uses a cb no one has a cell phone air conditioning is rare and outdoor priveys aren't unheard of for many of us this type of church and belief are foreign and it was sometimes necessary to remind myself that these people did and do exist arc provided by publisher","307":"this is a wonderful powerful debut novel about religion gone wrong there is nothing more evil than that which hides behind a disguise of righteousness wiley cash i will be anxiously awaiting your next book","308":" this is actually 3 5 stars i liked it a lot i've always enjoyed good stories from the south i married one thank heavens he never held up snakes in church though there were 2 things i didn't like one thing i didn't like was how when one of the 3 story tellers were telling the story they would stop and backtrack and begin telling something different that happened even earlier in the past to further illustrate what they were originally telling it just got annoying for me and i even wanted to just scan those parts sometimes so i could get on to what was 'currently' happening the other thing was that it was just too much that happened to jess i'm not going to elaborate because i'm trying not to give stuff away i want reality don't get me wrong i don't want candy coated chocolate endings but at least give us some hope jimmy was not the hope i was looking for it was a quick easy read wiley cash's debut novel was a great start and i would read whatever comes next it's a great genere i think it would be nice though to throw in at least one quirky southern optimist with a little side of humor to go along with all the dark no one likes to eat 100% dark chocolate it's just too bitter overall a pretty good first book","309":"phenomenal and heartbreaking highly recommended","310":"this was a good read but it certainly is a melancholy book i left me feeling sad the ending tried to be hopeful but it didn't quite make it there","311":"evocative beautifully written southern gothic novel jess and his brother stump a mute saw something they should not have seen and in their innocence do not suspect that the wrongdoer will avenge himself at a church service read it and weep","312":" wiley cash sure turned out a hell of a first novel three different narrators tell us their part of the story a small town in the deep south plagued by secrets death and an overpowering preacher with a criminal past the community is tightly bound each member seems have a darkness in their personal story but not one that drags you down just the kind that make us all human cash did an amazing job the plot and charactors wrapped me up tight into their little world i can hardly believe this was his first novel to add to it cash himself is a pretty swell guy and was a pleasure to work with","313":"i've had this book for a year just hanging out in the ever growing piles i bought it right after it came out knowing that i would like it but then other things and other books got in the way after meeting the very nice wiley cash at our local book store a couple weeks ago i was again inspired to read a land more kind than home i wasn't disappointed and overall liked the book typically i am not a big fan on books with multiple narrators meaning where each chapter or sections is told by a different or rotating narrator i also don't really love books that span long time periods this is why though i generally like her when i've finished i usually stay away from lee smith this one did both of those things except it didn't really span a long time period as much as flash back a lot i still liked it though and there were only three narrators so i didn't find myself doing that thing i usually do which is to skim through certain sections waiting to get back to the narrator s i really like i liked both jess' voice and the sheriff's voice i can see why adelaide's part was there but i didn't always feel like it was necessary honestly i'm still not really sure why i needed to know so much about how and why she came to live in marshall and since this book was so much about fathers and sons it might have been cool to just have the book narrated by fathers and sons i've been thinking about whose voice i'm missing here and i think it's ben's i feel like he plays such a role i mean of course he does but we only ever get to see him in side glances through other people's eyes i thought for a while that maybe the voice that was missing was chambliss' but then i decided no it was important to only see him through other people i will say that while i liked the book overall and was moved nearly to tears at the end and that rarely happens for me i did feel disappointed with the end of the book and felt like it fell a little flat for me that climax happened so quickly and then the book ends with this church wrap up by adelaide i don't know how i wanted it to end but that wasn't it anyway if you're a fan of lee smith ron rash or amy greene i think you'll like this one","314":"read my full review of this book on my blog summer reading project at a land more kind than home by wiley cash","315":"a beautifully told story that deftly captures a time place and community the story focuses around the aftermath of a church service supposedly meant to heal a young boy of his autism and is told from the pov of his younger brother an older mid wife who teaches sunday school and the sheriff each pov adds dimensions to the story and we see things unfold about the nature of the charismatic snake handling preacher as well as the personal histories of the pov characters","316":"two brothers see and hear something they should not have which sets a series of events in motion that no one can stop this novel takes place in a small town in the deep south the cadence of language and the pace of life is beautifully captured there are three main voices 9 year old jess adelaide lyle the town mid wife and conscience and clem barefield the sheriff very good read","317":"i don't know what it is but southern writers have a magic about them that allows them in a unique way to capture elegiac tone and heartbreak better than just about anyone this novel part mystery part tale of grief forgiveness vengeance and redemption is fantastic wiley cash is a name i will watch for in the future a fantastic debut novel","318":" i really enjoyed this book but i am a big fan of the southern gothic type novel the characters leapt off the page and the author perfectly captured scents and images familiar to those who live in the appalachian mountains of nc his depiction of the main character jess if one can call him the main character was a little off despite his research into the life and mind of a third grade boy it is apparent to those who have had a third grade boy that he has either never had children or had one to reach the age of nine ten but that's just my opinion overall a good read","319":"amazing best book i've read in a long time","320":"great southern literature like a modern day faulkner","321":" the book begins with a quote from one of my favorites thomas wolfe saying that in death one will find a land more kind than home this is a sad book about religion gone amuck in the hills of north carolina having lived in the piney woods of east texas i could see some similarities of how this can happen the story is told from three different points of view and at times can be difficult to follow but they are powerful voices and one aches for the children and their fates it does grab you and hold your attention to the not unsurprising end","322":"an interesting story told by three characters a young boy an older woman and a sheriff what goes on in a town like this is not something i can relate to religious fervor and complicated relationships made for a good story","323":"dark a little scary one certainly would hesitate to be wandering the hills and rills of the appalachian mountains in north carolina kentucky and west virginia after reading this book but overall well done with realistic characters and a realistic look at the underbelly of fanatical religious cults with serpent handlers as preachers and in case you think that doesn't exist any more take a peek at this article http religion blogs cnn com 2012 06 highly recommended","324":"i liked this book a lot it is told from three character viewpoints the writing is fantastic it is about a mute boy being killed by something that occurs in a church in the south it was chilling and what makes it chilling to me was that no one involved really seemed to be up front about this being a murder and that includes his family i cannot say enough about wiley cash's writing style","325":"torn between two and three stars","326":"a great debut novel in my opinion rich in appalachian culture and dialogue i especially enjoyed reading the afterword notes on the stories behind the book","327":"jess and are two brothers stump can talk so jess is very protective of him there mother is involved with her church and minister the minister is an evil man who used poisonous snakes in his church stump sees his mother and the minister through the bedroom window adelaide a midwife keeps the children out of the church but stump is called into the church to be healed where he dies the sheriff must find out what happened very interesting book","328":" this book will be released march 17 but i was able to have a pre publication copy i was so enthralled by the book i read it in two days it's a tale of a southern snake handling church the pastor the members and tragedy the tale is told by 3 persons a 9 year old boy an elderly midwife and the sheriff of the community the author seamlessly switches from one voice to another i was not distracted by this device and found myself eager to read each page the book encompasses love and loss joy and sorrow very well done","329":"snake handlers abusive fathers disreputable preachers matronly church women suspicious deaths adultery growing up all in an appalachian setting at times i felt the story got sidetracked by some of the lengthy flashbacks but overall i enjoyed this novel","330":" a brilliant debut stupendous on every level storytelling characterization setting voice tone language the voice of young jess hall will move you to tears you will live and breathe the air and dust of these tobacco fields one smells the woods and river the rain and snow every scene takes you deeper into the mystery of life the psychosis of faith the struggle to understand why humanity makes choices why love becomes confused and why families act as they do the narrative power builds on microscopic observations as layer upon layer of truths emerge out of the depths of troubled hearts all of these things implode in a tiny mountain town in north carolina the language and rhythm of the sentences undulate and bend with the shape of the land gorgeous chilling from page one the men and women who are fated to live this near mythical tale will live on in your heart and soul long after the final devastating chapters","331":"this tragic story unfolds in and around a small church in north carolina during the reign of an unstable parson who leads his flock far from their values told from the perspectives of a young boy jess adelaide the old town midwife and healer and the town sheriff clem barefield the authenticity and immediacy of this novel make it an engrossing and rewarding read after witnessing some of the twisted and sordid goings on of the congregation and some still closer to home both jess and adelaide draw their own conclusions and ultimately their silence leads the people around them further into temptation both jess' newly discovered shadowy grandfather jimmy and sheriff barefield confront issues of hatred atonement and forgiveness which are unearthed from the past as a consequence of the actions of the congregation and eventually we see true healing outside of church stemming from true evil within it beautifully written and paced interesting and endearing characters for the most part he had the courage to show faith to its detriment against common sense and only really diluted that within the last page or two","332":"set in western north carolina this is wiley cash's first book i thought he did a great job capturing the dialect and conversations of rural mountain folk a sad story that captured my attention through his descriptions of people and events","333":"the book lives up to its reviews told from the point of view of jess hall a 10 yr old boy the town sheriff and the local midwife wise woman each is interconnected with the other and you get their personal story while they tell the story of what happened when a charismatic preacher came to town and took over a small church i don't know if it is sense of place or the sense that you are part of this small town in western north carolina it feels very familiar each character is individual a real person not just an archetype this is the author's first novel","334":"an excellent book well written interesting to the end","335":"very engaging book from a debut novelist really enjoyed the author's writing style and how he drew me into this story about three indivuals from a small rural town in nc my only peeve was the ending it was left open ended maybe a sequel is in the works while i won't read a sequel i just prefer not to these days i will read another book from this author","336":" i liked this book it was well crafted the dialogue u0026amp emotions portrayed came across as very authentic my heart genuinely hurt for the losses suffered by jess wiley cash did a great job in walking the reader through the thought processes of a child and his view of the world i enjoyed the diffent points of view presented from a variety of characters and appreciated that the reader was given the opportunity to have glimpses into each of their lives the ending left me disappointed i wanted to see justice play out for the victims of the crazed preacher one unexpected element of the story that did keep me thinking though was a question really can a group of believers once lead so far off track by their preacher recover and continue on within the same church body and overcome the harm that's been done i will be anticipating wiley cash's next novel and hope he sticks to stories of the south","337":" it's a good read it's well plotted and the device of using multiple viewpoints works well however it's a little indulgent in its use of gothic plot elements for instance the villain is a preacher an ex convict and an adulterous snake handler with the exception of one character the women in this book are either weak or non existent the gory conclusion is unconvincing and reads like a transparent device to ramp up the pathos and draw the plot to some kind of conclusion all the same it is interesting and has a distinct atmosphere","338":"southern fiction is always a must read for me this is no disapointment a good story with entertaining and believable characters dialogue concise and fits the 'times'","339":"pretty damn depressing book i liked it but wouldn't recommend it to my mom i really don't even know how to review it it kept my attention but damn really is that how it had to end it might make a good movie","340":"i enjoyed the different viewpoints the book is written in the sheriff being the weakest character enjoyed the backstory on miss adelaide very much","341":"this is the best book i have read in a very long time so poignantly written wonderful character development and a great story line one of the reviews makes a comparison of the book to cormac mccarthy rewriting to kill a mockingbird good analogy","342":"mostly well written although i thought it could have been shorter every character does not need a back story especially when it does not serve to advance the plot one bit the bad guy gets punished but i was hoping that the deliverance was much stronger men committing evil deeds in the name of religion is not unique to any particular religion that much was very clear from the story though","343":"well written and evocative","344":"great first book for this southern writer interesting characters as well as story line","345":"great book kayla its a buy let me know if you want me to save","346":"incredible story that will leave you thinking about these two boys for a very long time","347":"i read this book because i enjoyed the early reviews of it i found the characters to be okay they were not as developed as i like for this type of story the story itself was very interesting i do plan to keep my eyes open for this author again in the future","348":"i really enjoyed this book could not put it down reminded me of sharyn mccrumb","349":"a bit slow but well written and satisfying","350":"this is a beautifully written book with powerful characterization it is told from three points of view a story telling technique that i happen to love because i know how difficult it is to write jess hall is the younger brother of stump a mute adelaide lyle is an elderly woman and former midwife and clem barefield the town sheriff the brothers jess and stump are endlessly curious which leads them into trouble and unleashes a chain of events that leads to a tragic climax what i most loved about this story was the way the author crafted the characters revealing bits and pieces of their pasts with both delicacy and power i especially loved clem for his essential goodness and his weariness of the evils of the world the author's ability to convey a sense of place through the personalities of the people that inhabit it is mesmerizing the ending is heart breaking but believable altogether a great read","351":"good debut novel definitely a page turner","352":"solid but characters failed to draw me in too deep","353":"i loved the writing in this book he has such a wonderful descriptive version of life and death i especially liked the part where he wrote about the dream the midwife had when her aunt died really beautiful","354":" a land more than kind takes place in a small north carolina town and reminded me of the southern culture of to kill a mockingbird it is a heart rending story of what happens to people and relationships over time how the past always touches the present and how an evil presence can upset an equilibrium that has been long standing i liked that the story was told in three voices innocent nine year old jess who wants life to just stay the same as it is for him and his mute brother stump adelaide who has lived in town most of her life and wants to protect the children and clem the town sheriff who has suffered his own losses and tries to do the right thing the story and the characters are compelling it is worth reading","355":"i thought this book was such a great book it was a real old fashion story that represented what can happen in a community that is influenced in the wrong way even though they believe in what they are doing every character was so well developed and the title is so fitting you have to think about it but it makes so much sense the author had an incredible understanding of the type of people he wrote about","356":"highly highly recommended this is the best novel i've read all year unbelievably well written with characters so genuine that you'd swear they really lived and really wrote their stories on each page the suspense kept me up late into the night reading and the language i could write my entire doctoral dissertation about the author's brilliant use of language powerful themes and bone chilling mystery not to mention the perfect ending the most perfect ending i've read in a long time i loved this book","357":"i wish it were longer loved the mountains and the people of the story","358":"one of the best novels i've read in a long time","359":"wiley cash did not so much ease me into the disturbing world of his novel as grip me by the throat and pull me along within the first few pages i knew to be very afraid of the charismatic snake handling strong arming carson chambliss i knew someone had died i knew children were involved and i felt the heart wrenching isolation of the people in this appalachian community through the eyes of adelaide an elderly midwife in fact as the novel opens adelaide is about to step into chambliss' church and meet him face to face cash takes a bit of a risk in starting his book right in the middle of the action without a lot of exposition to settle readers into the story but his risk pays off beautifully though this is his first novel cash seems to have already mastered the art of unveiling a story at exactly the right pace using three narrators he introduces the main players and just enough background to keep the story flowing and the pages turning he cuts from adelaide to jess a 9 year old boy on his way to seeing things he should not see and experiencing sorrow he should not experience through jess' eyes we learn about his brother \"stump \" a mute who is mysteriously inside that very same church jess' confusion brings the emotion and heartache of this novel right up to the surface i closed my eyes and thought about daddy having to see a miracle to believe in it and then i thought about mirages again about how miracles might be like that sometimes i wondered if it was a sin to think any less of a miracle just because you know it ain't real cash then cuts to the town sheriff clem who of course has his own tragic back story to compliment to novel's plotline clem is the \"rational\" voice of the novel piecing together the clues and providing us with the background information we need to understand how religion and evil became so intertwined again cash makes all of this flow seamlessly he is a gifted storyteller but what turns this from a really good book to a brilliant piece of literature is his use of language the appalachian mountains come alive through his descriptions the characters' voices practically sing off the page and even when he is using the passive voice we can feel the pain right underneath the surface of these people's lives but that tree that grew between them was just a gnarly old thing with thick roots that ran deep and wild and tore at the ground until it opened up and once it did julie found herself clear across great divide from ben so far apart they couldn't see each other from where they stood highly dramatic and deeply disturbing this is a great book","360":"this may not be everyone's cup of tea but i loved this book usually when a story is told from multiple viewpoints there is a lack of harmony although each of the three voices telling this story was distinct they also blended together nicely","361":"cash studied with ernest gaines and i have to say though they write of two different places and people as a reader i can see gaines' influence and style and how that has shaped cash's work it's almost like cash molded the pottery and it has the tiniest of thumbprints around the rim where gaines has rubbed off it's great to see that inspiration cultivated into a unique piece of literature the central event of the novel is a quick strike of horror and grief a young boy is killed as the result of some zealous church goers trying to cure him of being mute one of the narrators is the victim's brother another the sheriff and a third is a sunday school teacher their chapters are woven together to provide history to the town and to the characters we get different perspectives of who is to blame and who is responsible not just for this crime but for past hurt as well while i have no personal connection to the subject matter of evangelical snake handling congregations cash writes in such a way that it's like reading the familiar you lapse into the slow southern twang and the feel of the novel becomes very natural and genuine even when the characters are manipulators or manipulated and despite that familiarity of place and of knowing the setting intimately the reader never feels quite safe just like being an outsider in a small town secrets are kept from you and you can never get too comfortable with the schema you have concocted for someone it was an intense book and i'd encourage charles frazier fans to pick it up especially if they liked his nightwoods book and i'd even say that if some jodi picoult fans want something a little different but still personal and gripping they'd probably find something of value here for a debut novel i'm beyond impressed cash knows exactly how wide to set the scope so readers get only the the most necessary information for the story there's no fluff or heavy handed metaphors it's well controlled i can't say i loved the story it's never anything but depressing to read about immense grief but i loved the way it was told","362":"not my favorite book but very well written too much church in it for me it wasn't what i expected when i read the back","363":"great plot great writing couldn't put it down included on the indiebound list for book groups and it would be a good choice for discussion","364":"prepare yourself to enter the darker side of faith false prophets lies and tragedy follow","365":"wow it was reallly good i would really give it more than a 4 5","366":"the book was ok i really enjoyed the author's explanation of how the book came to be found at the back the story felt like it needed more depth i enjoyed how the book was split into each character's point of view","367":" i might be a little in awe of wiley cash and his masterful way of narrating a story from multiple perspectives all of which offer different slices of the truth a land more kind than home takes place in rural mountainous north carolina it deals with tragedy within multiple generations the perspectives of an eight year old boy an old sheriff and an older woman all combine into a powerful narrative about faith love and honor that follows a tragic yet compelling trajectory read it for yourself and see ps i also enjoyed wiley cash's a million heavens which has more perspectives but also has a very powerful and positive end","368":"this book was a quick read","369":"fast read a frightened 9 year old caught up in back country life it could happen","370":"very good in the beginning slowed down in the middle but ended with a pick up in pace my real problem with this book was connecting with any of the characters except jess it wasn't an awful book but also not terrific","371":"rounded up from a true 3 5","372":"a snake handling church in the mountains of north carolina of course i had to read it i got totally immersed in this story wonderfully and fearfully told in three voices","373":"snake handlers ugh a sheisty preacher a willful follower and her two sons make for an upsetting story that you just know is not going to end well disturbing","374":"even though i knew the outcome would be bad i needed to know what would happen next","375":"one of the best books i've read in a while this may be one of the books i know feel compelled to recommend to everyone i know","376":"good southern lit summer read not a topic i've read about but liked having something different than the same old story line","377":"gastonia boy makes big a very good novel true to the author's north carolina roots feels like ron rash and tom franklin in the best ways","378":"when i started reading a land more kind than home i did not expect to stay in my chair until i finished it but that is indeed what happened i do not remember the last time i read a book non stop wiley cash creates characters that one quickly cares about and i highly recommend this book to everyone who loves good storytelling","379":"a compelling story of goodness innocence and naivete against corruption and manipulating evil it is set in rural western north carolina and reveals how easily manipulated the undereducated and vulnerable in that population might be","380":" the tale of two brothers jess and christopher stump hall and the various repercussions that come with seeing things that are meant to be seen curiosity can lead to answers and adventure but also danger some questions aren't meant to be answered especially by the naive investigation of children one stolen peek into a window changes the paths of the hall boys' lives forever the eccentric and slightly mysterious carson chambliss immediately takes over the church in the small town of asheville following the prior pastor's death he takes down signs covers the windows with newspaper and pens a simple verse in black paint on a small sign outside those drawn in stay those who question or remain skeptical stay far away ben and julie hall's marriage changed the day stump was born he never cried he was quiet too quiet time would soon reveal he was mute ben understood stump's quiet ways often relating while julie believed she could bring the words out of him she also believed in pastor chambliss adelaide lyle had called asheville home long enough to know all there was to know about the small town's inhabitants she knew ben hall as a child she knew the church before it was overhauled by carson chambliss she helped bring stump hall into this world and she knew her town well enough to know when trouble was in the air on a hot september night the life stories of jess stump pastor chambliss ben julie and adelaide all intersect with an ending that ultimately teaches two of the small town's residents that it's a good thing to see that people can heal after they've been broken that they can change and become something different from what they were before slow moving in parts i found many of the story lines to be incredibly poignant the repercussions of a child's curiosity and how it can change his life in unforeseen ways the resonating effect of a parent's decision the power of restoration and the gripping control of revenge the first book this year to keep and hold my attention the whole way through","381":"wow very powerful forgiveness and understanding comes out of a tragedy wiley cash is an incredible story teller loved it despite the cruelty and darkness","382":"probably closer to 3 5 stars i enjoyed the story telling and cash captures a lot of my personal experiences in the north carolina mountains snowy roads and such not so much snake handling but southern tour de force it is not i look forward to his future works","383":"one of the best books i've read in a few years it's of the variety that you hate to finish this is a well paced often understated modernized appalachian hat tip to the sound and the fury and a very very good one","384":"rooted in the tradition of great southern writing this is an artfully crafted and very engaging book cash skillfully weaves his tale with three distinct narrative voices he has created one of the most memorable villains in recent history the book is at times heart wrenching and at times reaches palpable levels of tension a great book and a great read","385":"i thought this book was pretty good but don't think it was as good as the average rating suggests i never got super invested in any of the characters i was also glad that i listened to it as an audiobook i'm not sure i would have kept going if i had been reading an actual book","386":"this was my kind of book loved the southern tragedy well written characters and story liked the different perspectives of characters a bit like kent haruf or cormac mccarthy in that some things were sparsely written and the reader is left to figure some things out i also liked that everything wasn't wrapped up in a neat bow with a hollywood ending can't wait to discuss at my bookclub meeting","387":"i rarely give a book five stars but this book came close it was well told like an old story from the hills told time and time again you just fall into it the characters are amazingly familiar yet different enough to hold your interest having grown up in the hills of virginia close to the border of north carolina i could have been reading about my relatives chambliss is one of the most evil characters invented for someone who only appears a short number of times in the book he certainly holds the fate of everyone in his grip i felt so bad for the whole family especially for jess things like this shouldn't befall a little boy ever a great read and i would certainly recommend it to anyone whether they were a fan of 'hill' stories or not","388":"fantastic but brutally sad","389":" this is a beautifully told story about people and a backwoods mountain life about which i know virtually nothing we often drive through small towns in west virginia and north carolina and wonder about the people who live there the ramshackle houses and the small churches with odd names that we pass by have occasioned comment but this book suggests that more may be happening in those out of the way places than i ever dreamed i've certainly been aware for some time that charismatic faiths exist and even that there are people who handle poisonous snakes during religious ceremonies and although that is certainly an important part of this book the main themes are more about revenge forgiveness faithfulness good and evil than about snake handling cash's character development and lyrical description of place are wonderful i highly recommend this","390":"very beautifully written story of innoncence trumped by evil the writer's fondness for his voices is evident throughout as he lets them tell their stories in their time and their language lovingly crafted characters terrific sense of time and place reminded me of larry watson this book is so moving and i will remember jess for a long time","391":"this starts out as a good story but the author too often strays from the original story at the wrong time to tell the back story of a character","392":"recommendation from a friend who is friends with the author set in western nc excellent characters and sense of place creepy stuff religious fanatics snake handling family secrets one flaw was that book was written from perspectives of three different people although there was rich characterization it seemed to limit the overall depth of the story if felt a bit choppy at times i would read another book by this author","393":"a varied and eclectic cast of characters a mute boy is dead and nobody is talking in this small town there's religion and there's whiskey and there are lonely women and jealous men it's a town where boys will be boys and some boys are bullies it's a town where the sheriff is determined to get at the truth","394":"beautifully written propulsive generous dark i've read so many books like this that start out with an intriguing premise and an exotic setting and after about the first 100 pages things taper off and it becomes a whole lot of navel gazing wiley cash is economical with his words and his information without being stingy i felt like i was always getting new information but not so much that the larger themes and premises became muddied in terms of the focus at times i wondered why we were going so deep into clem and adelaide and not a bit more into chambliss but in retrospect it makes sense there were so many forces at work here and in stories as in life we only get to know so much some forces we understand fully others only halfway still others we don't even know exist","395":"a really wonderful book well written and very different i was prepared not to like it but fell into the story's arms and those of the characters involved was sobbing at the end i give it a 10","396":" i raced through a land more kind than home from the riveting first chapter to the heart pounding finale the characters feel like people you might know the setting is tangible and the story itself full of unique turns and twists still feels like something that could have happened right down the road for truth is indeed stranger than fiction readers who enjoyed amy greene's bloodroot will also enjoy cash's narrative style and fans of the television series justified based on elmore leonard's short story fire in the hole will dive right in and never look back i can't wait to read cash's next novel","397":" set about thirty years ago in western north carolina a land more kind than home is the story of two brothers their bond and how innocent childhood snooping can lead to the most devastating consequences told from three distinct points of view the novel starts with the foreboding observations of the town midwife adelaide lyle about the sinister preacher carson chambliss who came to town out of nowhere blacked out the church windows with newspapers and started holding secret services involving faux healings snakes and near hysteria following adelaide is jess hall-a nine year old boy who adores his older mute brother stump and who gets himself into the usual amount of trouble for a boy his age it is through his innocent musings and instinct for trouble that the tension begins to build the third narrative voice is that of clem barefield the sheriff of madison county he's a man worn from a lifetime of grief and trouble but one who exudes a better kind of empathy for it his remembrances of jess's father as a young man and his painful relationship with the entire hall family are what ultimately force the novel to its terrible climax while reading a land more kind than home i felt echoes of faulkner and tennessee williams but cash has his own style like other southern novels place looms heavy as a character and metaphor through physical objects plays out brilliantly the story can be read for the physical action or pulled apart for the layers what results is a true symphony of plot theme and character make no mistake this novel is devastating but cash is able to redeem his characters in the most beautiful and fitting conclusion a land more kind than home is well worth your time and emotion it is one of the best novels i've yet read this year and i won't ever forget it i give a land more kind than home my highest recommendation","398":"cash is on fire in this his first novel it is not quite american noir but gets close and certainly is a dark grey throughout the story is compelling and more worryingly is based on true events but what gets the 5 stars in my book are the sections in between the incidents wonderful description of small town life in the deep south the characters are strong and real and that rarity a great finish shades of mccarthy but mccarthy at his best and for a first novel that is a high compliment it won a prize as a crime novel and i'm not sure it fits completely into that category either many of the best books are hard to categorise looking forward to his second highly recommended","399":" growing up in marshall means trouble when your mother catches you spying on grown ups adventurous and precocious jess is enormously protective of his older brother christopher a mute whom everyone calls stump though their mother has warned them not to snoop stump can't help sneaking a look at something he's not supposed to--an act that will have catastrophic repercussions shattering both his world and jess's it's a wrenching event that thrusts jess into an adulthood for which he's not prepared this story is told by three narrators jess hall a nine year old boy adelaid lyle the town midwife and moral conscience and the sheriff clem barefield who has his own painful past i really enjoyed this book although it is a tragic tale with devastating consequences i had to keep reading to find out what would happen i felt sorry for jess and what he had to go through as a result of keeping a secret although it ends tragically there is a bright spot among all the sorrow it was interesting to me to see the power that one man had in a small community and how the people allowed him to have that power this story and characters will stick with me","400":"another keeper great characters very sad story definitely worth reading","401":"interesting story set in the hills and hollers of north carolina it's about family loyalty retribution religious zealotry and redemption told from shifting perspectives it centers on a near cult like country congregation and its diabolical pastor whose healings are more about power than compassion well crafted and paced","402":"just did not interest me could not get into it and gave up","403":" this book cycles through three different first person narrators relating the events of one terrible sunday in an eastern north carolina town a charismatic preacher who likes to use poisonous snakes during his ceremonies is suspected of causing the death of a young mute boy during one of these healings the boy's brother the local sheriff and the church's sunday school teacher tell the story through their differing perspectives and it's brilliant how cash lets each reveal the smallest details spooling out the depth of the scandal almost like it was a mystery yet the writing on a sentence level is very pastoral conjuring those carolina hills with just a few strokes a land more kind than home is a book that's both gripping and beautiful plot driven yet reflective it only misses the five star mark for me because i would have preferred just a bit more of the latter i look forward to other cash novels where he may stretch out more let us sit with the characters a little longer","404":"i liked the way the story was told through the voices of three different people","405":"a great first novel i'm starting to really like reading first novels the authors are saving up their best stuff for their debut this one is intense and moody but has a unique beauty too a good recommendation if you like southern literature william faulkner harper lee the villain is a snake handling preacher to give you a taste","406":"well written and engaging story told from three different points of view excellent","407":"what can happen when religion goes wrong","408":"loved this though my sense of justice demands an epilogue wherein julie has to confront what chambliss actually did and why","409":"thank goodness a book that lives up to its' reviews this is cash's debut novel jess hall is nine years old and lives in the sleepy town of marshall north carolina his brother stump is a mute who has never spoken jess knows you can get into trouble for spying on grwonups but he couldn't have imagined the consequences that result cash makes the characters come alive and you won't want to come to the end of this story","410":"engaging certainly a look at a different lifestyle cash takes the reader into the lives of religious snake handlers in rural virginia he tells a compelling if unlikely story and does a pretty good job of selling it one thing he does not do which i really appreciated is draw his characters as cartoons as so many writers do with southern characters he comes close but doesn't cross the line","411":"this book leaves you sad and a bit empty the only likable characters in the story are stump and jess this is a very human story everyone is flawed some in more tragic ways than others","412":"disclaimer i won this book through the goodreads first reads giveaway but my review is 100% honest","413":"nice effort for a first outing look forward to future writings of mr cash but i wouldn't go so far as to compare him with william faulkner or cormac mccarthy that would be a disservice to all","414":"a very well written story a very small rural southern mountain town told in three different voices the sheriff a lady from town and a nine year old boy","415":" up near asheville in the great smoky mountains evil resides this is the place where folks endure much because they believe in god jess hall is 9 and his brother stump is mute and autistic stump sees his mother julie lying in sin with the amoral pastor carson chambliss of the river road church of christ in signs following terrible things ensue jess is terrified of the evil he sees around him the language is spare and beautiful this is an evocative work about love fate and redemption","416":"a beautifully written powerful novel hard to believe it's the author's first novel","417":" in a small southern town a big church can have a lot of power especially when a pastor like carson chambliss rolls into town with crates of serpents and radical ideas healing prayer and being called home to jesus for most of her life midwife adelaide lyle was a member of the town church but after a particularly devastating sunday service she decided that she could not be a part of what was going on behind chambliss's doors in fact she was so horrified that she sat down with chambliss to insist that no children be allowed into services and volunteered to host sunday school each week among adelaide's students are jess hall his older brother stump and joe bill jess is one of the three narrators of a land more kind than home he is 9 years old and the keeper of 11 year old stump who is mute joe bill is his best friend and child partner in crime one sunday jess's mother pulls stump into a church service jess and joe bill are curious and feel left out so they spy through a crack in the church's wall to see what's happening in short they're terrified clem barefield is the third and final narrator he is the town sheriff and is used to having a somewhat easy beat when he gets a call about the goings on at chambliss's church he's shocked and dragged into a drama that continues to grow larger and more tragic each day i read this book in one sitting at the end i found myself poised with one hand over my heart feeling a wave of emotions it never brought me to tears but a land more kind than home brings to mind all the darker parts of human nature including but not limited to the lengths people will go to to belong to prove commitment to believe in the potential for healing the actions they'll take to protect loved ones and the terrifying side of evangelical worship favorite quotes i wondered if it was a sin to think any less of a miracle just because you know it ain't real 46 but since then i've learned to just go ahead and take fairness out of the equation if you do things stand the chance of making a whole lot more sense 109","418":"loved this book each chapter written from different character's perspective first time novelist hope to hear more from him","419":"what a great read at times i felt a bit uncomfortable with some of the characters guess it's my anti weird religion bias but all in all a wonderful book","420":" once started i had a hard time putting this one down the mystery wasn't in trying to figure out what happened since we know that from the beginning but in seeing how the characters will react when they find out the story of a mute boy's death during a healing at church is told by three different characters his younger brother the sheriff and the sunday school teacher all three characters were very well written with distinctive voices i was most frustrated by addie's character i feel like the author wanted us to see her as the moral voice but i feel like she's the one who could have prevented almost every bad thing that happened just by speaking up and she was certainly given chances to do so yes jess might have been able to prevent it too but he's a scared little boy so he gets a pass i'm not sure if there was meant to be a reason that addie stayed quiet but if there was it went right over my head i'll be thinking about this one for a while scary to think how real some of it was","421":"a wonderful southern flavored read keep an eye out for mr cash he's a talented wordsmith","422":"wiley cash is a writer i am very fond of reading his work is so enjoyable that i did not want to stop reading did not want the story to end i first found out about him through a unc asheville family newsletter my daughter attends the university i knew immediately this was an author i wanted to read and ordered his book right away it did not disappoint","423":"this sad lovely debut novel set in appalachian north carolina is narrated by three characters a nine year old boy a sixty year old sheriff and an 80 year old midwife cash has granted each a unique believable voice we know from the opening pages that a young boy died during a healing service at a secretive local church cash makes us wait for the details but he fills the intervening pages with interesting back stories who recommended this book to me three weeks back i found the title and author inked in vaguely familiar handwriting on a random scrap of paper that i was using as a bookmark i am indebted to you","424":"well written in different voices which i like a story containing this level of transgression could use more redemption i think possibly poses the question of people's ability to change or not it was compelling and easy enough to read while sick on the couch though so it was a good escape","425":"this book is a quick read because you can't put it down it takes place in madison county nc and probably is full of far too many truths about the backwoods snake handling churches in the mountains the story told through the eyes of three of its characters is about a family including two young sons stump and jess the former being deaf the story is filled with love and tragedy and has a grasping ending","426":"a debut novel beautiful flowing prose couldn't put down","427":" this is a quality debut novel this southern gothic goes awry when a boy is killed in a healing in a snake handling church led by a corrupt preacher it's not perfect but there's so much that's so well done the characterization is great the story is told by three characters precocious 9yr old jess sheriff clem and midwife adelaide the three voices add a lot of layer and emotion to the story the pace does slow some with the back stories of each of these characters but a slower pace is pretty typical of this genre cash is not only a great storyteller but the writing felt effortless i do wish a little more had been said of julie's character who i was furious at but with the way the plot unfolds and the limiting views of the three narrators i can see why more didn't get said still the reader was given a good idea of the faults of the other characters and by the end you are so caught up in what's going on that i felt julie's personal character and the part she played was glossed over if you're expecting a great wrap up at the end don't but somehow i'm not really bothered by that with this book","428":"i learned from another reviewer that the title of this book came from author thomas wolfe more specifically this quote from the book you can't go home again \"something has spoken to me in the night and told me that i shall die i know not where saying death is to lose the earth you know for greater knowing to lose the life you have for greater life to leave the friends you loved for greater loving to find a land more kind than home more large than earth \" i cannot stop thinking about those words they must have had a profound effect on wiley cash as well and they suit his novel well i would like to rate this book 4 5 starts there's just something i can't quite name holding me back from a 5 star rating the story is heartbreaking and very engaging i had a hard time putting this book down i just wish i would've finished it at home instead of in the lunchroom at work it's one of those books best ended with a good cry i think","429":"wonderful southern fiction looking forward to his next one","430":"i really liked this book although i didn't care for the ending i enjoyed the characters very much they were well written and easily related to most people i wanted to kill chambliss myself i found him to be a pompous ass really felt sorry for jess and of course stump the book was really well written and i would be more than happy to recommend this read","431":"this was a good read well written and an interesting story about the south small towns and the influence of the church","432":"evil exists in this small north carolina town the strength of this debut novel is the rich characterization of the people who live here and how they interact with this evil","433":"two young brothers in small town north carolina are witnesses to something that changes their lives forevet","434":"this is one of those books that i never would pick up on my own but turned out to be really good i read this book because it was the next book in a book club and i have to admit it was hard to put it down especially toward the end it was a totally unexpected ending that kept me interested if you're looking for something different read this book","435":" one sunday in the mountains of north carolina nine year old jess hall should have been down by the river with the other children instead he and his friend joe bill were trying to find out what happens at the church where the windows are blocked with newspaper to his horror jess watches as his mute brother is smothered during a healing service local sheriff clem barefield must untangle the tragedy and violence that follows in a case that reminds him of his own dead son a land more kind than home is a heartbreaking story about family relationships and faith cruelty and innocence the tragic story is told through three people jess hall adelaide lyle and clem barefield and each has their own voice despite the three narrators the story is easy to follow and i think the three of them give slightly different angles to the story that of a little boy who experiences more than one boy should of an old woman who dislikes the way her church practices and that of the sheriff looking in on the whole situation the book's tag line is \"religion is supposed to shield children from the evil of the world \" but instead we find adelaide lyle trying to shield the children from their local church from carson chambliss a pastor with unconventional and dangerous ideas from the readers point of view chambliss is thoroughly unlikeable to say the least he likes to think he's got power and to some extent he does power over his congregation this is one of those situations where those on the outside of the church can see that what is going on isn't right however those in the church faithfully follow their pastor like lambs and without question i really felt for poor little jess things go from bad to worse for him and he thinks he could have made a difference if he had spoke up maybe it would maybe it wouldn't but there's one thing he knows life will never be the same this literary thriller is perhaps an unusual read for me in one respect i normally steer clear of books with a religious thread i don't know why i've just seemed to have steered clear of religion from a very young age despite my great grandfather having been a lay preacher based on a true event a land more kind than home is wiley cash's debut novel and a thoroughly good one at that it is a gripping read and one that draws the reader in recommended","436":"i think that the characters could have been a little better developed at certain points throughout the book i had trouble picturing them otherwise an enjoyable quick read","437":"nicely drawn characters i really cared about what happened to them but the story was more heartbreaking than anything","438":"this was a great book i tore through it in most of an afternoon and was anxious to pick it back up and finish it the next day very well written and engaging will definitely recommend it to others when it comes out","439":" without question a land more kind than home is the best book i've read so far this year it follows the story of a small north carolina church and a series of tragedies that befall the parishioners the writing is breathtaking and impressive in its own right but i was shocked to see this is mr cash's first novel this does not read as the first novel of a man who's still learning his way around the narrative process he's taken off running and his work far exceeds other contemporary 'greats' with dozens of novels under their belts the story is told from the first person perspective of a variety of narrators i sometimes find this type of writing to be clumsy or to feel gimmicky and unnecessary that was certainly not the case here there wasn't a word or phrase out of place and the variety of voices gave the story a much more interesting and authentic feel this is the kind of book that makes you cancel your dinner plans so you can perch uncomfortably on whatever seat is available while you race through the words to try and make sense of it all highly recommended","440":"southern gothic north carolina small town evil disguised as faith young 9 yr old protagonist lyrical great characters cp tom

read","442":"jess's mother goes to the follow signs church where snakes are handled and poison consumed the pastor wants to heal stump jess's brother who is mute jess holds secrets about his mother and the pastor and then about what happens to stump inside the church","443":" there's a lot to like about this book set in appalachia the scenes were vivid in my mind and often disturbing there's a charismatic preacher whom one character compares accurately in my opinion to the devil the main character is jess a nine year old boy who is charged with making sure his older mute brother stump is safe their mom punishes them for spying on others probably because she has something to hide jess and stump spy nonetheless with disastrous results i didn't buy the resolution because it didn't ring true to me still it's a story that stays with me","444":"i'm not sure if it was because of the rural north carolina mountains with the tobacco fields or the church but this book took me home granted i never went to a snake handling church but i loved the setting and story here i actually listened to this book on audible but would have loved it just the same it has a rural kentucky feel to it as well and that's why i think i was drawn to it either way i'll be buying this to keep on my shelves as well","445":"wow this story is a wonderful debut by author wiley cash the voices of the characters are distinct and unique and you care about them instantly the tale unravels smoothly and perfectly up to the end i couln't put this book down i carried it everywhere mr cash i can't wait for your next telling of tales","446":"such a good first book by a writer i will keep my eye on the book is charming heartbreaking and completely engrossing each of the three main characters are complex flawed and so utterly honest you really do feel like your part of the small town plus it has a slight supernatural edge to it as well which is always a plus for me highly recommended","447":" he said they'd speak in tongues heal each other talk about the devil like he lived next door wiley cash's debut novel struck an immediate chord taking me back to the early days of my writing career when i researched charismatic religions for my second book awakening and discovered the wonderfully weird church of god with signs following with its origins in the appalacian mountains of the southern us states the church of god... practices that the power of the lord will protect true believers from all harm in his name worshippers drink poison pass through fire and handle venomous snakes despite the delicious irony that to this day most snake handlers in the appalacians die from snake bite this and similar pentecostal sects grab a tight hold of small isolated communities this book to some extent awakening too are about the damage that an untethered access to zealous religious practices can do a young mute boy christopher hall has been smothered to death during a church service in the chapters that follow christopher's brother jess an elderly lady of the parish and the town sheriff a man with demons of his own try to piece together events leading up to the tragedy the sheriff in particular and to some extent the reader want to reach some understanding of the sinister grip the charismatic preacher carson chambliss holds over the town the book is extremely well written with an authentic voice wiley cash is above averagely talented even for a published author for me though and for a number of other reviewers i've read a land more kind than home lacked something other than a passing sympathy for the nine year old narrator no real emotional connection was made from start to finish it lacked heart it lacked depth it lacked the hard kick in the guts a book like this should deliver where it should have made me weep it just left rather a nasty taste close to four stars in fairness because of the quality of the writing and the originality of the idea","448":"this book had such a strong sense of place the language the characters the landscape i felt like i could see them all in some ways the weathered characters with their painful pasts made the ending seem inevitable but it was still shocking and sad i felt like this should be made into a movie but i think it was because of the vivid writing it felt like i could see everything which made it feel like a movie engrossing and riveting","449":"this was a free book that i received as a part of goodreads giveaways i loved this book having three narrators was very innovative and effective i hope that this will be listed on the ap list of book choices because i want my class next year to read this book the characterization was wonderful i left this book knowing i would return to it and these characters again and again","450":"a great read southern gothic in many aspects and featuring a set of distinct voices who serve as narrators i hope dr cash writes many more","451":" this is a very compelling story of a charismatic preacher and his snake handing congregation it's told through the point of view of three characters one is a little boy and my heart broke for the the things he had to witness and endure along the way the characters reveal the past and how it shapes the present the author captures beautifully the fundamentalist mindset and how the actions of believers often contradict their stated beliefs i felt like i knew these people and loved them well most of them in spite of their shortcomings","452":"decent liked some characters way more than others","453":"a very enjoyable debut novel by writer cash set in western n c the story begins in the viewpoint of adelaide lyle now an old woman looking back at how things used to be in madison county the writer paints a quite vivid portrait of a small town sights smells tastes etc things change abruptly with the arrival of one carson chambliss a fundamentalist preacher who takes over the town church and plasters over the windows with newspapers he conducts a different kind of service one with snakes when a parishioner dies of snakebite some members take out her body and lay it in her garden for neighbors to find at that point adelaide demands that children be removed from the services and takes them in her care for protection viewpoint then shifts to a young boy jess hall who spies on the service through a gap in the wall he sees chambliss and others holding down his mute older brother christopher aka stump as he falls from his perch jess yells out mama and his mother mistakenly believes that for the first time in his life stump has spoken a word an obvious indication that chambliss is healing him a short time before this healing jess and stump's young mother has sent them out to look for salamanders while she and chambliss get it on in the bedroom stump returning earlier than they expected spies on them through the window chambliss sees stump when the boy falls down breaking the rain barrel beside the window

meth lab blew up a sixteen year old girl was killed in the explosion and chambliss spent time in prison for the deed stump is taken back to the church for more healing and is killed in the process the rest of the story is told by adelaide including a lengthy section of backstory about her childhood which for this reader could have been shortened considerably the story ends in a violent shootout with death and finally reconciliation a most worthy first work by cash look forward to more of his work","454":"a great southern gothic read characters you care about and true to place","455":"the writing was excellent but the subject really made me uncomfortable i knew what was going to happen and i didn't want to put myself through that uncomfortableness","456":" a southern story that holds true to the ways lives were led ways family moved interacted and their beliefs the story read as if the people place and events had come from writers such as faulkner and joe lansdale to name a few the child narrative was captivating the blessed mute child the family struggle to break from dark past the closed church with papers blocking view from passing eye a gothic story that's tragic that touches strings of the heart and puts a spotlight on extremities this story has a community that have their daily dosage of god talk delivered by a pastor who has ways that tend to tip to a more extreme practice as the eyes of a young boy in this story testifies this boy who has a brother that has been mute since birth he can't make out all this emotion in belief in this godly world these adults talked about his world was still innocent and a learning curve he can't quite figure out evil at his age but what he sees speaks waves echoes of fear and sorrow he can't understand why the secrecy when he finds out what occurs behind closed doors he fears of being found out and feels sorrow for what could happen to his mute brother in the hands of the evil that men do many a wolf adorn a sheep's clothing and in this story you feel an evil lurks in peoples ignorance blinded by desire and wanting a greater good man falls and fools man is no prophet or god and but you see in the world man is playing being actors prophesies when there is no need and playing the prophet messenger and dictator when there is no need the land shall always abide but many shall fall will false notions and convictions instead of embracing the beauty and the visible miracles of god around the characters in this story choose to take matters in their hands and the end result can only be tragic and how you will feel for one young soul in this story and how you will warm to this great story full of many great things the authors way of telling this story has you thoroughly immersed and captivated you feel and connect for the vulnerable and wonder at the ignorance the secrets people allow to have covered until its too late the price weighs so heavy on the victim and the heart weeps so endlessly with those they leave behind that kind of belief has been up here a long time before i arrived on this earth and it's my guess it'll be around for a long time after i'm gone but i've seen his work firsthand and i still can't put my finger on what it is and why it affects folks like it does ten years ago i saw a man set his own barn on fire while his family just stood out in the yard and watched it go just because he thought it was the right thing to do i suddenly understood the kind of mind that could convince gillum to set his barn on fire and i suddenly understood why a group of folks would hide behind newspaper covered windows while they worshiped and i finally realized what was in those little crates they carried in and out of that church on wednesday nights and sunday mornings but other than suspicion what did i have what could i do arrest a man for exercising his religious freedom that child was touched and i just don't know what else you could call it he never cried once as a baby and by the time he was three years old those two kids knew he wasn't ever going to speak he'd hum sometimes or maybe even grunt when he wanted something but that was about it he was quiet all right but you couldn't say he wasn't peaceful he could spend all day sitting still on the porch steps with just his eyes creeping around the yard to take measure of the things resting just out of line with your won gaze the tree line the ridge an earthworm inching itself along through the dirt i used to sit with him when he was just little bitty thing and sometimes i got to believing that i could feel his eyes on me when i did i'd whip my head around right quick to try and catch him staring but i never could i'd find him instead just siting there with his eyes locked on a black spread of birds moving in silhouette against a bright sky or else watching the edge of the breeze rustle the dried leaves on the oaks crowding the ridge behind their little house \" it's a good thing to see that people can heal after they've been broken that they can change and become something different from what they were before revie also @ http more2read com review a land more kind than home by wiley cash","457":"i adored this book the story telling was very well paced overall i thought the characters were well developed the violence in this story escalated throughout the story and it created a feeling of discomfort and sadness for me especially from when the 2 boys are playing basketball and the big brother starts shooting his bb gun at them but it was a very compelling narrative and i enjoyed this book very much","458":"amazing first novel can't wait to read his next one","459":"you know what i love a fast paced book that jumps into another gear around page 90 like this one does if you like crime novels southern fiction and or stories about faith this is a book for you","460":" first i have to say that mark bramhall is the greatest audiobook reader ever i actually picked this book because he was reading it and then it wound up being a great story the story is told from 3 different characters perspectives and includes their backstories and so uses three different readers the other two readers also have very good voices for their characters if you are looking for a good rural story that may not have shocking twists but keeps you interested and caring about the characters i recommend this one","461":" this was a very good book a story about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western north carolina town the story is told by 3 main characters jess a curious boy adventurous and precocious and enormously protective of his older brother christopher a mute adelaide lyle the town midwife and moral conscience and clem barefield a sheriff with his own painful past i enjoyed the place setting as it was small town without being in the past so many small town novels are pioneer type settings i wanted to get to know each character more i really felt attached to each and understood their particular point of view the 3 narrators were all of differnt ages so it was interesting to get different viewpoints of the same situation i recommend this book","462":"4 stars because it was so well written especially as this was the authors first novel 4 stars also because it was rough","463":"wiley cash paints a picture that draws his readers into the scene in his opening sentence and he retains their immersion even after the last line a land more kind than home is a story of redemption faith and truth in the remote mountains of beautiful north carolina secrets lie and grow behind the shaded windows of a mysterious church but truth shines forth in the end and god's light shines once more within those walls the walls of that building and of the people within the community","464":"a stunning debut novel from flannery o'connor's christ haunted south cash is one of those writers who very quickly captures and transports his readers across voices and events in a way that makes for a very compelling and moving experience i look forward to reading his next one","465":"excellent book the subject matter may offend some people as it is about a church that believes in snake handling and speaking in tongues the results prove to be disastrous i highly recommend it","466":" author wiley cash lets his debut work a land more kind than home be told through three distinctly different voices a young boy an elderly lady and a salt and pepper sheriff this dark and disturbing blend of religion superstition and manipulation reveals painful human vulnerabilities even the most devout believers may have chinks in their armor the elements of truth in this work of fiction are unsettling and just as nature has its way in the wild the weak are culled from the herd the predator here is a preacher but is he a man of god or is he the devil incarnate the characters are well drawn and the story line is as old as mankind itself my favorite voice was the sheriff a seasoned lawman with keen southern sensibilities the contrasts in the ages and life situations of the three narrators add just the right balance snake handling and speaking in tongues is still a religious practice in parts of the united states i live in a small town in the va mountains and i have heard of churches which partake of these rituals but they are not located in my home area a land more kind than home is set in rural north carolina and it has a true feel for the land and the people wiley cash is an author to watch and i hope he continues to tell his tales with a southern accent review copy gratis amazon vine","467":" wiley cash's first novel is not great but it is really good it evoked a wide ranging and deep discussion at the reading group for which i read it i acquired my copy as an ebook from my library i like getting to borrow an ebook but it vanishes on the day it is due now it is three weeks later and i took no notes so must rely on my memory to write about it in a small north carolina town tucked into the mountains nine year old jess lives with his parents and his autistic brother stump they have a unique relationship because stump does not talk dad grows tobacco and mom goes to her pentecostal church she is looking for answers because of stump believe it or not these people are so cut off and backward compared to modern life that they don't know anything about autism some of them fall for a preacher who has them handling snakes and practicing the laying on of hands for curing illness or casting out demons all i will say is that something very bad happens to stump in that church i know this stuff goes on in the american south a few years ago i read robert hellenga's snakewoman of little egypt a better book by the way and did some research on pentecostal churches it seems that oftentimes these churches that go in for snake handling and all the other strange practices are led by preachers who have crossed over into a psychopathic zone and wield some freaky power over their congregations such is the case in this novel i like dark southern tales this one was marketed as a literary thriller it won the british crime writers association dagger award for a first book and is in the coming of age genre as well all quite ambitious and successful what worked for me were the characters and the plotting jess his grandfather adelaide lyle who serves as the town's midwife and is the true healer there are all so well drawn you feel you could touch them the evil preacher the mom and actually every character just jump off the page in equal measures of description dialogue and action it is the excellent writing that make the book as good as it is underlying that is a kind of religious tone about faith and redemption i don't doubt the author's awareness or belief or whatever it is he has grappled with but his execution just made me a little squirmy it is not that i don't like novels with religion in them but as in writing about sex it has to be done well","468":"a heartbreaking but moving novel about the power of religion the bonds of family and the ability to forgive great book especially if you like southern gothic loved it","469":"i love these books i know almost nothing about where the inside flap leads me to suspect one thing and it goes in a totally different direction a review said it would knock your socks off and it did just that","470":"wiley finished reading your novel around 10 p m last night and as you can see by the hour of this e mail it has given me a sleepless night in my youth as a student at ohio university i had the privilege of serving coffee and actually speaking with literary giants such as robert frost randal jarrell and robert penn warren later i met john irving and toni morrison and now in my dotage i've been privileged to know wiley cash and read his first novel thank you you may find this amusing but i know the characters you created will stay with me through my remaining years like those in gray's elegy the ones that chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul you have given your north carolina people voices that reveal a dignity of character that seldom is acknowledged your mentor gaines is right this novel is just the beginning of a long and fruitful career i must say it was not the kind of read i anticipated having heard you read what was once the first chapter i thought i knew the plot i did but i was totally unprepared for the route of the plot the journey through the lives of adelaide lyle and jess nor was i prepared for the power of your description through each character the depth of your description reminded me of passages in faulkner and updike that i hoped to have my students appreciate for their power and brilliance i think land is equal to john grisham's first and perhaps his best novel a time to kill and in the character chambliss you capture the nature of pure evil all the more frightening because it has found a home in religion it is that evil that threatens our political system now clem's description of chambliss smiling through the windshield as he enjoys the thought of being the good guy gave me chills and that description of him forcing adelaide to the floor made me gasp i can't wait to see the coen brothers' rendition of your novel fran mcdormand would be a powerful adelaide too bad clint eastwood is too old to play clem powerful wonderful read wiley i can't wait to read the next one jcole","471":"unrelievedly grim and depressing","472":"a very slight predictable plot should have been a 10 page short story but was padded by the most inane descriptions of each mundane movement and thought in each characters day","473":"my reading buddy tricia recommended this as a 5 star read and she was right on a powerful novel with powerful characters and religion at its very worse in the hills of north carolina the characters are developed beautifully

first novel crystalline writing that makes you long for something you lost but you're not sure what","475":"his is the first novel from this author and one of the best first novels i have read for a

own right this old testament based tale contains all of the events of a biblical epoch but set in the modern day it can also be likened to greek tragedy in its exposition i hope that this first novel is a harbinger of a yet to be delivered series of books from a remarkable new talent highly recommended","476":"one of the very best i've read i agree with reviewers who said this would knock your socks off extremely powerful full of tragedy love redemption and somewhat reminiscent of other authors hard to believe this is his first novel reminds me of how good cold mountain by charles frazier was when it first came out","477":" i wish goodreads would add 1 2 stars to their rating system because i would rather give this book 3 5 stars the bones of this book are good especially for a first novel there was enough unknown to make you want to continue reading that's for sure i found the book a little hard to follow at times and it was unclear if the story was moving forward or at times told by flashbacks the characters were difficult to embrace but i think that could have been the intent of the author just to prove how messed up this little town was the most important paragraph to me was on pg 305 when adelaide is speaking about healing i appreciated the way cash allowed characters their own chapters to speak i definitely look forward to seeing what is next from this author","478":"3 85 i loved this book broken hearts broken lives broken churches a superb first novel","479":"this superbly written book captures life in the hills and hollers of north carolina almost effortlessly from the detailed descriptions of the mountains to the cadence of the language cash tells the tragic story about what happens when fanaticism fear and family collide a land more kind than home centers on the events of one evening when an autistic child dies mysteriously at a worship service presided by a con artist snake handling preacher the story is narrated by three different people adelaide lyle - an elderly church member who doesn't trust pastor chambliss and has taken the children away from the services jess hall - the younger brother of the child who dies who knows things that he doesn't understand and sheriff clem barefield - who must discover the truth no matter the cost or consequence i really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it a book filled with guns lust religion whiskey and snakes isn't a bad way to spend a weekend","480":" wow what a stunning surprise to read this book it captured me from the first page and continued to build with it's suspense pathos and sheer literacy wiley cash weaves a beautifully painful story which takes place in the hills of western north carolina during the late 70's as told through three narrators whose lives become tragically intertwined jess hall a nine year old boy adelaide lyle an elderly midwife and clem barefield the elderly local sheriff carson chambliss is a charismatic charlatan who has recently arrived in the town and started a new church which deals in faith healing adelaide has witnessed events there behind the papered over windows that prompt her to steer the local children away jess has an older brother christopher who was born mute and the two like to spy in on things going on around them one day they accidentally spy into their parents bedroom window and see something they shouldn't meanwhile jess's mom julie has come under pastor chambliss's spell and decides to see if the pastor can help christopher again jess's curiosity about what is going on causes him to peek into the church through a crack and again witnesses something that frightens him and his unintended response triggers a chain of tragic events he is terrified at telling anyone about the things he has seen sheriff barefield has a long history with jess's grandfather which years ago had something to do with the accidental death of his own son he has come across reason to suspect something wrong with the newly arrived chambliss and an investigation confirms his criminal past in louisiana a dramatic chain of events bring the three narrator's stories together in a heartbreaking climax this book has movie written all over it and is very reminiscent of the 2010 movie winter's bone\" which won critical acclaim","481":"i wanted to adore this book its setting is my hometown the author shares my alma mater and it's a southern gothic story while cash's writing is strong particularly for a debut novelist i felt nothing for any of the characters i had a difficult time returning to the novel because i didn't feel invested in the story that being said land has its merits a well written debut a good story well drawn setting overall solid southern fiction cash nailed our dialect and colloquialisms not an easy feat but the dialogue and storytelling felt effortless i look forward to cash's future endeavors melisa","482":"fabulous book","483":"great book by an author who teaches at bethany college which my daughter attended about a snake handling church very well written","484":"well it's just me i'm finding that numerous points of view is less intimate so it tends not to stick in my mind as well as one point of view still cash handled it well and created vivid memorable scenes interest wavered mid book but finished strong i have a problem with pastors always being the bad guy how refreshing would it be to read about a pastor who was a good guy so the faith is grounded in the people themselves and not the leader which is fine and true but the person who is the standard bearer for the people of faith in the book stands up solidly in some ways and not in other ways when it could really count which again is true to life but something about it felt lacking like the faith is relative and cash had to add a we still believe ending to balance the evil in the pastor perhaps i'm being too hard and another reading might move it up a star definitely worth reading","485":"i cannot rave enough about this book the writing is gorgeous so gorgeous i got goosebumps i was mesmerized by the characters the plot everything from page one really it doesn't get much better this is a book to treasure to reread to share","486":"wondered when the story was going to get going until i got it it's laid back aand truly southern good liked it","487":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here incredible book no wonder the author teaches writing and has a phd in english great first novel told by 3 different people detailing the southern church with speaking tongues and rattlesnakes and a very crooked pastor who was a prisoner at one time blew up his meth lab and told everyone that god caught him on fire to teach him a lesson and a teenage girl died in that fire as well a bit sad how jess ends up only with his grandpa at the end","488":"great debut novel i am looking forward to his next novel","489":"review is here","490":"this book had me hooked from page one great read","491":" someone compared this to a greek tragedy and i think the comparison was apt it's a well crafted story with deeply rich characters whom you grow attached to through the weaving o the plot and i appreciated that however it's extremely sad maybe even a little excessively so at times so i had trouble getting through some of the slower sections as i knew there was only more sadness to come it's definitely worth a read for the characters and the beautifully created atmosphere and tale but bring the tissues and be prepared to need to take breaks","492":"it was just odd i really liked the book but wanted to know more about the characters it was told so indifferently how and why the characters came to be was never explained could have been so much more than it was","493":"the book called to mind the world of flannery o'connor a broken world with little hope it's like watching from the mountain while the train below races to where the tracks have been destroyed by the flood you know tragedy is coming but you can't stop it and you can't look away the multiple narrators remind me of as i lay dying and engage me on all levels i won't get over this story anytime soon","494":"this is a great read the characters are fully developed the plot is interesting and the scenic descriptions are so realistic that i felt as though i was a hidden inhabitant of this county for the short span of the book it is the story of a rural north carolina town where a church and its members develops cult like rituals where relationships are torn apart and as a result of these actions the fallout is disastrous for all concerned very well written","495":"if you don't know how to heal yourself then you don't know how to live when times are hard p210","496":"authored by a former college professor of mine a land more kind than home is one of my favorite reads in a long long time a few critics have drawn parallels between this book and the classic to kill a mockingbird and i definitely see it great villain great protagonist an all around great book can't wait for his next","497":"perhaps 4 1 2 stars really really good book southern in every way the author's writing was just beautiful and really set the tone for the entire story a boy dies in a church during services and all that surrounds the event and the church preacher boy's family are part of the story told from several points of view which really works highly recommend","498":"this is an amazing book beautifully written it evokes the feel of the small north carolina town told through three voices an older woman who is a midwife and the conscience of the community a young boy who has seen many things that he should not and the local sheriff this is a novel about good and evil and all that is in between this book is haunting one that will stay with the reader for a long time","499":"fairly neutral about this book although i appreciated some parts of it i don't feel glad to have read it dark story with heavily stylized narrative that got in the way for me because it wasn't done well enough slippery slope for books","500":" i picked up a copy of this at our independent bookstore in bozeman god help me i paid full price based on the review i saw on the tattered cover website by cathy langer a first novel this is a writer i will do my best to keep an eye on told from three different perspectives this novel of a family in crisis in the hill country of western n carolina was riveting set in the early 60's the action centers around a charimatic but dangerous pastor of a community church a tragedy that occurs within the walls of the church that spills out into mayhem in the present while conjuring up the tensions of the past that led to the undoing of the principle characters the writing was solid and the characters sympathetic","501":"hard to believe this is a first novel spare bold muscular prose such beautiful writing each piece of dialog is pitch perfect it's set in the mountains of western north carolina and told in the voices of three people viewing the events from three different perspectives addie lyle a midwife and healer jess hall a 9 year old boy and clem barefield the sheriff it reminded me of flannery o'connor's short stories in the way small seemingly insignificant events and the innate qualities of each character build on each other until their cumulative weight force an inevitable crisis this book is a page turner and you know it's bound to end badly for someone but there are several possibilities and you don't know which of these characters you've come to know and love will walk away at the end here's just a smidge of description that i loved i knew there were hollers in places below me where it had been dark for almost an hour but up here on the ridge the sun was struggling to be remembered and i could see red and gold still lighting up the sky in the distance on the tennessee side of the mountain i love that image of the sun struggling to be remembered it put me right there standing on the ridge with him how is it that so many great writers come from this part of the country flannery o'connor fred chappell lee smith clyde edgerton many more now i have a new writer to add to this list wiley cash he's a writer to watch i will look forward to his next books","502":"3 5 really suspenseful story but i couldn't get over the fact that there was not enough explanation given as to the how and why and the ending seemed to me just a tad too convenient","503":"i really enjoyed this book and especially the writing style it was told from three different perspectives but you stayed with each character for several chapters so it didn't jump around too much i had some unanswered questions but i thought it was very well done","504":"full review can be found here but in short i definitely recommend this book it is not what i would call light summer reading by any means but it is well worth the time and emotion to read it it is a good solid first novel and i look forward to seeing what wiley cash will write in the future","505":" i love debut novels there is nothing quite as exciting as hearing a literary voice for the first time particularly if it is fresh and vibrant and new of course there are the inevitable one hit wonder books that seem to suck everything the author has from them or the debuts that garner so much acclaim that their authors' sophomore attempts inevitably pale in comparison but then there are the books like this one a land more kind than home tells the story of a young boy whose innocent curiosity sets into motion a series of devastating events we watch these events unfold through jess's eyes as well as via the town midwife and sheriff the writing is pure and sweet the story is one i haven't read before and the characters were vivid and memorable there were some issues with pacing and focus i think but overall there was something terrifically exciting about this novel and i suspect that wiley cash will be back again with more excellent storytelling and just so much promise here","506":"loved this story","507":"3 75 stars will let this one marinate for a few days","508":" the first half of the book was so good after that though i felt like the story wandered the author would go on long irrelevant tangents about characters that i didn't care about i thought the book didn't come together very well either i think the book was about change how people react to different events in life and how those events change them at the end of the book some people had changed for the better and some had changed for the worse my main qualm with the book was that there weren't any truly redeeming or inspiring characters it wasn't particularly moving it ended kind of blah the first half was great though","509":"i liked it but would have rather the mystery element was excised altogether and the book just examined the lives of the people tangled up in the church decent characterization but it lacked that certain sense of place or time that is able to teleport the reader to the setting a good debut though and i'm curious to see where wiley cash goes in the future","510":"this is a disturbing story of the catastrophic results of following a religious cult and the disturbed man in charge this is a powerful well written novel","511":"loved it i was drawn into the story right away not a happy one to be sure but compelling and beautifully written","512":"i'm partial to books set in the southern u s this book is well written but the story is rather creepy a good read though and worth finishing","513":" this is not my typical read it's set in appalachia and involves a snake handling almost demonic preacher who holds undue sway over his congregants it's told from the point of view of a 9 year old boy the elderly midwife and the town's sheriff the plot gets spun out as the narrative bounces around from one to the other in turn just occasionally i think the author gets slightly lost in back story but never for a moment lost my interest i read this in just a few days it grabbed me from the first word to the last it is absolutely worth your time to read","514":"it is a wonderful feeling to select a book begin reading and then to discover that you are captivated by the characters and so impressed with the story and the prose that you allow yourself to savor every word very sentence and every paragraph nine year old jess is an old soul living in a young boys body his love and dedication to his mute older brother reminded me of the bond between my own sons the situations issues and circumstances could have been rough to maneuver but...wiley cash wrote with both courage and finesse highly recommend this story to everyone who loves a book who challenges readers to think to feel and to react","515":" a land more kind than home is based in rural america and is about a church going family that try to heal their son christopher stump in church this goes tragically wrong and stump dies the book is told through the eyes of 3 people and each chapter is intertwined around these 3 characters and this is how the story is told the characters telling the story are adelaide lyle sunday school teacher and local midwife jess hall the brother of stump and clem barefield the county sheriff i found the book wonderful to learn about country church life and the way they feel about hands on healings but i felt the book ended without a climax it just seem to drop and end i would have loved it to have gone into more details about how the family dealt with stumps death","516":"beautifully written and hard to put down can't wait to read wiley cash's next book","517":"beautifully written with wonderful characters and a poignant story","518":"occasionally it comes to me that i have been enormously fortunate to have lived long enough to experience a particular piece of art this is one of those times i would hate to have died before getting to read cash's first book in my opinion this is right up there with steinbeck faulkner raymond carver and larry brown","519":"as sad as this story was i really enjoyed it and couldn't put the book down i got into the characters and kept hoping for the best for the family","520":" just finished this stellar debut novel in a matter of hours because after the first 50 pages or so i couldn't put it down the voices of the characters are so clear and genuine as a north carolina native i could hear my home state in every page i loved the way that cash explores rural communities religion ethics and fear through the lives of these characters full disclosure i went to high school with wiley and his brother cliff so i might be a bit biased but i would and do still recommend this book unreservedly to everyone who can appreciate a well told story that thrums with the pulse of real life","521":"a great read from a debut novelist","522":"this was an excellent book wiley cash's use of voice was amazing the story was told by a several different characters and each had a distinct voice a land more kind than home was set in the south and each time i picked up the book i felt as if my own place shifted the air became heavier pace slowed it was that good i read this book in 3 days because i couldn't wait to get to the end looking forward to his next book coming out in january","523":"very good story","524":"although it was a pretty decent book i didn't think it was one of the best i have read","525":"very well written would read this author again slightly disappointed in the ending after the climatic scene at the end it started to fall apart for me but still a good read and would recommend","526":"loved this book loved the three voices who tell the story the beautiful prose the character development i loved the symmetry of the plot and i even loved the end we don't need to know it all we knew enough bravo","527":"wow what a debut cash has written a page turner set in rural north carolina where even though the reader has a good idea of what is to come one cannot put the book down the story is written from three different points of view all three characters who give voice to this story have distinctive and believable voices cash's characters and dialect are rich and convincing with the exception of julie whose values and choices seem too internally inconsistent to be believable i know that julie was meant to be a conflicted character but i believe cash took her lack of steadiness too far a land more kind than home is such a strong novel that i still believe it is a five star worthy book i look forward to cash's future novels not since deliverance has an author so perfectly evoke a particular part of the south","528":"couldn't put it down but the ending was not what i hoped for","529":"a must read","530":" what a good first novel i could hardly put the book down from the first page lots of tension throughout vivid imagery and detail a good read told in three voices--adelaide lyle the town midwife spinster moral conscience who has not attended the church for ten years clem barefield sheriff who continues to grieve the death of his son and jess hall a 9 year old who has to grow up too fast jess has an older brother christopher called stump who was born a mute jess and stump see things they never should have seen and those events contribute to death and destruction for jess's parents ben and julie julie attends a snake handling church led by carson chambliss a pastor with a very troubled past he's very charismatic--and exercises power and control over the congregation even to the point of having death covered up by members in spite of adelaide's confronting him with the truth stump dies after an attempted \"healing\" by hugging and laying on him julie doesn't see the sham of it all the love has gone out of her relationship with ben who's become a drinker just like his dad who was inadvertently responsible for the death of barefield's son jeff i wasn't expecting the ending even though i should have there are no winners in this back hills tale the book blurb says \"a haunting tale of courage in the face of cruelty and the power of love to overcome the darkness that lives in us all \" the reading group members and i disagreed with that writer's opinion we weren't sure of courage nor the power of love overcoming darkness in this novel we also had some questions about setting and time some aspects didn't quite jibe","531":"interesting subject matter on a rural evangelistic community church and the evil pastor who totally manipulated his followers depressing but well written and an engaging read","532":"this book is delicious the writing is beautiful the characters are real and the jackleg preacher is scary one of the absolute best appalacian dramas this year can't wait to read what else wiley cash has to offer","533":"wonderful riveting tale of a north carolina family their church and a bunch of poor decisions","534":"very we'll written and a bit of a page turner the only thing keeping me from 5 stars is that i just wasn't in love with any of the characters and didn't really move me but i liked it very much love books written from multiple character perspectives with change in each chapter","535":"really more of a 3 25 3 5 star rating for me due to the pacing which seemed off however i think the author did a great job expressing the consciousness of the various pov charaters especially the nine year old boy","536":"i really liked this book at first i wasn't sure about it because it bounces from character to character but the story comes together nicely it was a book i saw on this website and i am glad i read it","537":"a strong plot interupted in the middle of the book by a collection of short stories that are intended to add depth to each character but does really very little to develop the overall plot of the story i didn't feel that the climax and conclusion of the story was particularly well tied up","538":"this book has everything i love a southern setting secrets family tragedy religious zealotry run amok and strong narrative voices if i had read it it would have been an easy four stars but because i listened to it and the audio version is one of the best i've ever heard it's getting five stars this is a debut novel is it flawless no but you know what i didn't care i don't think you will either i got so swept up and carried away by the story i was being told i was living it i was right there in that small town watching it all go down with a flutter of anxiety in my stomach and a lump of sadness in my throat what really made me love this story as an audiobook is that we have three narrators read by three different readers 1 jess hall a precocious nine year old who has a penchant for spying and will eventually see something he wishes he hadn't that will change his life and the life of his town forever 2 adelaide lyle a feisty old woman who has born witness to much of the town's history and dark secrets and 3 clem barefield seasoned sheriff with a painful past who must confront the evil that has taken hold of his town like a cancer getting the story from these three very distinct voices and points of view is fantastic it makes what is essentially a simple and straight forward story feel richer more layered and emotional i loved the reader for the sheriff what a fantastic performance that voice married to the author's prose is a match made in heaven in the best ways it reminded me of tommy lee jones's performance in no country for old men a land more kind than home is set deep in the heart of snake handling country where you better hope that when the preacher arrives in town he ain't the devil in disguise read this book and if you do the audio thing listen you won't be able to stop i promise and since i have a thing for book trailers this one does a great job of capturing the edgy southern gothic mood of this novel that's so portent with revelation betrayals and tragedy this review can also be found at busty book bimbo","539":"probably should be 3 5 stars beautifully written southern fiction with complex characters it reminded me quite a bit of the movie sling blade for some reason although the evil faced by the young boy in this book is the town preacher instead of the stepdad the plot meanders a bit that is my only complaint","540":"it's hard to believe that this is a debut novel the prose is stirring the atmosphere nearly touchable the characters memorable of course he had one heck of a mentor ernest gaines but this guy has all kinds of talent plus he's smart enough to stick with what he knows best the folks scenery and culture of north carolina this story is about an old midwife a charismatic preacher a sheriff and two small boys one of which is autistic it's about secrecy and forbidden knowledge that starts a chain reaction of tragedy that leaves one family and a whole town changed forever this is an exceptional book and the start of what should be a brilliant literary career for this impressive young man","541":"i think what i like best about this book is the revealing of raw emotion wiley cash is very good at ripping the heart open and showing how it beats","542":"southern literature at it's snake handling best i really enjoyed this book and it left me thinking about the symbolism of the snakes the mute boy and the scarred preacher","543":"what is the reason that this book is so well received sorry to say i thought it less than suspenseful interesting or well written","544":" i'm glad i didn't read a blurb about this book before i purchased it on my kindle b c if i had i probably would not have even given it a chance the story line plot sounds awful and it is but it is so well done such good writing i'm so jealous of his writing the story didn't grab me at page one like someone else mentioned it took me a few pages but very soon this book has you heart and soul it's a fascinating read and a page turner which i love love i do wish i had read it in a paper real book format because on the kindle i was frustrated when i wanted to turn back and read the first few pages again the more i read on my kindle the more i like real books that said i still like my kindle when traveling but i digress this is a great book i recommend it and hope the author gets another book out quickly","545":"i really enjoyed this book and especially the three perspectives the story is told from these three characters gave the story unique perspectives of the same town events and people and were interesting voices to read i love novels about extreme religious events groups cults somewhat of a suprising ending too","546":" wiley was an acquaintance of mine in middle and high school and we attended the same church i was always fond of wiley when i saw he had written his first novel i was anxious to read it i pre ordered the book on itunes and the day it was released i can remember sitting in my university's library reluctant to bookmark my current page to attend classes that evening though i devoured the rest of the novel it captivated me from the beginning it's a provocative tale of courage and self discovery i highly recommend it to all","547":"i have nothing to add to the most deserved praise this book already recieved from other reviewers i read the german edition furchtet euch and can only recommend this pageturner wiley cash is certainly one writer to watch this one could become the next jim thompson","548":"this sounds like an incredible read i'm really looking forward to reading it lots of dynamics and i love stories from small towns always makes the characters spring to life","549":" this is a near perfect book by wiley cash it was given to me as a gift and i'd never heard of wiley before that now i'm in that place where i'd love to devour anything he's written right down to his to do lists it's a simple story really a tragic tale set in the appalachian south that covers snake wielding preachers adultery addiction betrayal and a mute but beloved son the story is less important than the way it is told the viewpoints vary between characters and the story slowly unfolds as we learn about the backstories of the major players the most captivating parts for me were the sections told through the eyes of jess hall the younger brother of christopher who is mute and everyone calls stump this is a must read if you like in depth character studies where the plot although rather obvious unfolds over time","550":"this book absolutely consumed me i loved every second of reading it i could barely put it down and when i had to it preoccupied my thoughts it is thoughtful and though provoking heart wrenching and rich with character emotion and story i cannot say enough about this writer's ability to affect and engage his audience","551":"for the first 100 or so pages of this book i wondered what i was doing staying with it i was almost bored to tears but then i got roped in a gentler and more prosaic donald ray pollock style of writing it was very interesting a the end and by the time i got there i was glad that i kept turning those pages very different but mostly pretty darn good","552":"meet carson chambliss evil personified and the small town people who have to negotiate their lives while he's in town this character is creepy beyond words and harms many people i think it's worth reading","553":"thriller i don't think so i saw the ending coming from the second chapter it was a fine story but nothing about it made it stand out from other regional authors it could have just as easily been written by nicholas sparks or anne rivers siddons i did like how it was told from the different viewpoints of three central characters that was the only thing that kept me interested enough to finish the book","554":"not often do i find a book that refuses to let me put it down a land more kind than home was that kind of book","555":"this story of terrible events related to a fundamentalist religious community could have been set anytime in the past couple of hundred years so it was a little disconcerting when modern touches crept in the story itself is compelling and well constructed with sympathetic and recognizable characters","556":"a great first novel about a death in small town north carolina told in alternating voices a writer to watch great atmospheric feel conveyed","557":"except the ending","558":"great southern thriller about the crazy mountain people of western nc loved the fact it was told through 4 different characters and their voices around a tragic event with 2 little boys great story told so well definitely a page turner","559":"this was one of the best books i have read in quite some time genuine heartfelt story","560":"not many books make me want to move to west virginia to take writing classes from its author matter of fact not any books prior to this one but this book moved me it made me cry like i was reading an earlier larry mcmurtry novel actually this author treats his characters with a love very much like mcmurtry although the plot of \"a land more kind than home\" doesn't quite live up to some of mcmurtry's novels it's a rather simple story not simplistic but just kind of predictable and lacks complex social commentary however the three protagonists who take pov turns in the book are so well drawn that even though i've never been to appalachian country i still felt like i knew these people a really solid debut novel from an author i'm excited to follow","561":"i received this book from goodreads as an advanced readers copy this book kept my attention throughout and although i usually don't read anything that has to do with snakes i read this whole book i have encountered people like the ones described in this book i can't wait to read more from this author i don't want to give away important parts because i feel it leads the reader to not form his or her own opinion but i really liked this book and think others will as well i have several of my friends that i think will really like this book as well","562":"as others have said this book definitely evokes tom franklin both in tone and scope the story of two brothers who innocently become involved in a towns scandals and aberrations a sheriff whose own life is broken and irretrievably linked to their family and an elderly woman who stands witness to all seething with small town passions this tale rushes to its conclusion but leaves much to contemplate in its wake","563":"at first i wasn't too sure about this book because i figured the southern hick speech would be too off putting for me but i quickly got over it as i became immersed in the story itself wiley cash has a great way with words that sucked me right in and wouldn't let me go i plan on reading more of mr cash's books he impressed me so much with this one","564":"a fantastic debut novel chilling read","565":"was pretty boring could not get into it no character development whatsoever and then everybody dies i felt nothing but boredom and when will i be done with this drivel since the get go","566":"i planned on liking this book it had a great deal of promise from the get go with it's setting in a small town in western nc and a title taken straight out of thomas wolfe unfortunately wiley cash didn't quite live up to the wolfe legacy and it seemed he could have but just missed the mark the story of carson chambliss a sinister snake handling preacher and the hold he has on his congregation is told through three different points of view there is adelaide lyle a elderly midwife who senses more than she wants to reveal clem barefield the sheriff determined to bring the pastor down and jess hall a nine year old boy whose mute brother dies suspiciously during a healing a land more kind than home was touted as a southern gothic tour de force and a literary thriller but it fell short it wasn't an entirely badly written book as far as prose is concerned in fact i'm hoping wiley cash gives novel writing another shot this was a good concept just a bit watery the story could have been a bit darker chambliss just wasn't fleshed out enough more attention could have been spent on his malevolence under the guise of faith jess was the same little boy growing up fast we've met dozens of times before and adelaide and the sheriff just weren't compelling characters despite the generous treatment of their respective backstories this isn't one i'd particularly recommend","567":"well written good character development i could not put it down","568":"a little hard to get into but ultimately i enjoyed it","569":"tragic story told by 3 of the characters was hard to put down once started because i wanted to see what happened next very good book","570":"overall it was a great read and hard to put down it meandered a bit in the middle but not for long solid characters plot and writing","571":"i haven't read the complete book because it won't be published in usa until april 17 however i have read the first chapter and an excerpt from chapter 5 wiley cash is a new writer and this book shows literary talent i'm hooked on the story line and can't wait to find out more about his characters who seem real sometimes an author's first book is overlooked until the second one comes out and then people go back and read the first book john grisham's a time to kill wasn't noticed until the firm was published i believe this first book by wiley cash will be successful","572":"superbly written the story and characters drew me in a tragic southern gothic novel that is slowly pieced together by three unique voices i'll keep an eye out for cash's next novel","573":"i really liked this one there were 3 narrators in this audiobook the old woman the sheriff and the boy and all were just right for this southern gothic with a nasty snake handling villain my kind of book","574":"told from three perspectives 9 year old jess hall 80 something addie lyle and sheriff clem barefield the story describes what happens after a healing goes wrong at jess's mom's church still thinking about it after i finished it last night","575":"great book reminiscent of turtle warrior","576":"this is my first review of any of the hundreds of books i have read on this site and i thought it was excellent i love a book when i cannot put it down this had me from the very beginning not too dark and the characters were developed just enough a must read","577":"this kind of book is unfortunately a dime a dozen small town crazy people things go bad that involve children a villain a hero a loser a winner all in a package of words i read it for the purpose of book club on to the next","578":"extremely well written i felt like i was right there in each scene great characters who are all complex and interesting","579":"dark and absorbing i've read two mountain southern books in a row and the evils of liquor are herein replaced with the evils of religion and misplaced hopes and the darkness and goodness that exist all at once deep within the human spirit a damn fine novel all the better since the author is a north carolinian","580":"in the mountains of north carolina two young brothers see something they shouldn't and experience their world spinning out of control","581":"a quick read well written and intriguing","582":"anyone who doesn't read this book is going to miss something very special this was one of the most amazing reading experiences i have ever had","583":" set in a small north carolina town this is the story of jess hall and his mute brother stump its told through the voices of adelaide lyle the town's midwife clem barefield the sheriff and jess being children jess and stump snoop on the adults and see something they shouldn't which has far reaching consequences jess must grow up clem forgives a past wrong and adelaide reveals the truth of an old crime you feel for jess and his confusion as he doesn't understand the adult world but must live with the decisions made by his parents and the minister this an interesting look at the power of one man can have in a small community and how the people allow him to have that power you won't be able to put this down once you start","584":"i read to the end of chapter 2 page 52 in my text edition and found even that hard going the dialogue read like hackneyed stereotypical appalachia and the details such as they were were not enough to spark my interest in the past from having stuck to the absolute bitter end with such over hyped tomes as the story of edgar sawtelle i've learned that 50 pages is a fair run if there's not enough to recommend a book by that point there is good reason to move onto something else i'm not sure who this book would appeal to to kill a mockingbird it ain't i suggest passing unless you have a particular fondness for reading about snake charming preachers who bed female members of their congregation not recommended even the quality of the writing though not abysmal hasn't left me eager to sample wiley cash's future productions","585":"great first novel very descriptive of characters u0026amp surroundings i'm sure more fine works will be written by wiley cash","586":"this was a good story and a well written book but i didn't really enjoy it all that much the pace was too slow for me and there wasn't quite enough action","587":"unlike the characters in much inspirational fiction this bunch does not wear their christianity on their sleeves it's truly embedded in their rural appalachian culture nor is it always inspiring the religion the worldview the landscape of this rather isolated place feels truely lived in this tale of a faith healing gone terribly awry","588":"wow i can hardly breath great audiobook","589":"an interesting story with well developed characters i have a hard time with stories told in character chapters the three star rating is for that kind of telling","590":"started audio book on way to atlanta only got through 2 cd's and wasn't getting it but picked it back up today and may try to finish just ok for me","591":"loved this debut novel i have an affinity for stories about crazy religions cults and this one is fascinating to me a 13 year old autistic boy sees something the pastor of an evangelical church thinks he shouldn't have seen and the church has two healings to try to save the boy the second healing kills him i'm not giving anything away with that three povs tell the story the younger brother the sheriff and an older woman who has spent the past 20 years trying to protect children from the church great voice straightforward writing that tells you more about settings and people than any metaphor can southern gothic","592":"i don't know if it's the whole story as i felt that's not the end anyway i like it","593":" in this his debut novel wiley cash demonstrates enormous talent and potential particularly i think in his ability to compellingly narrate from the perspectives of both an eight year old boy and an eighty year old woman and that's why i'm awarding the novel four stars and for the sake of consistency i enjoyed this novel at least as much as chad harbach's debut outing in the art of fielding which i also awarded four stars however i didn't particularly love the story which was incredibly intense yet slightly boring all at once and which failed to engage me emotionally notwithstanding how moving it should have been in addition the story telling itself could have used some tightening up less superfluous narration less superfluous back story e g the chapter dedicated to adelaide's girlhood and more focus on the characters of ben and julie and their failed marriage which is more or less just thrust upon the reader and on preacher chambliss who at times seemed little more than a caricature replete with a past life as a meth cook was he really the penultimate villain as many reviewers suggest was he truly evil as adelaide believes i just don't know i suspect that if a land more kind than home had gone through a few more intensive drafts something truly incredible would have resulted in the end but the novel as published is merely good not great and as noted it is also somewhat boring largely due to the narrative superfluity as i remarked to a friend it reads like something that would be assigned in a lower level high school english class over written and emotional an impressive debut but a novel that i can only recommend with reservations nb not sure where this fits in my review but i couldn't help but be reminded of donald ray pollock's the devil all the time when reading a land more kind than home both are to some extent redneck noir and both include a young boy to whom terrible things happen and an evil backwoods preacher but whereas the former aims and strikes low the latter aims high and strikes somewhere in between the difference between the two authors however could not be more stark pollock is cruel nihilistic exploitative sensationalistic unredemptive cash is the very opposite for example when i ran home in the drenching rainstorm more than could have sufficed we get this i stopped running when i ran out of breath and i slowed down and walked up the road toward where it curved around in front of the rock wall below the highway right above me water ran down from the highway like a little stream and it spilled off those rocks like a waterfall i stood on the side of the road and reached my hand over the guardrail and let the water run through my fingers it ran in the gully beside the road and then got carried down toward the river i followed the gully where it ran alongside the road before it headed down the bank toward the river i stepped out onto the bridge and looked over the side at the river where it ran faster and louder than it had when i'd walked over it on the way to joe bill's house there were sticks and leaves and stuff in there and i watched it all float toward the bridge before it went under there and came out the other side i pushed back off the rail and walked to the other side of the bridge and looked over a car passed by and slowed down when it saw me like it was going to stop i waved but it just kept on going i figured whoever it was in there probably wondered what i was doing out there in all that rain given that the novel is merely 300 pages long a great deal of the text is wasted on narrative frolics like the above which are simply not sufficiently lyrical to justify their inclusion","594":"beautifully told and story reminiscent of kent haruf's plainsong and eventide i did the audio and the readers were excellent","595":"my mother always warned me that sticking your nose in places it didn't belong might get you in trouble jess definitely saw something he couldn't unsee and it affected him deeply writing from a child's point of view is tricky especially when the child is faced with such complex issues i thought wiley cash easily captured the emotion and actions of a young boy although i wasn't thrilled with the ending of the book i recognize that it could have ended no other way the story line was easily believable i have been to a snake handling church and let me tell you nothing that happens there would surprise me and the writing itself was good enough to not get in the way of enjoying the story","596":" cash wiley's debut novel a land more kind than home is a glorious read he has a fabulous descriptive writing style that makes the reader feel like they are right there in the hills of north carolina he brings the way of life of the people there to life he is a storyteller who has a powerful story to tell i love southern stories for some reason probably because they celebrate the reality that people are are far from perfect we have faults and idiosyncrasies we are all a product of our surroundings like people everywhere many of the people in hills have religion at the center of their lives and like people everywhere they can be easily be misled by a charismatic preacher a wolf in sheep's clothing such is the case in a land more kind than home i can easily relate to false prophets and wiley cash is portraying a particularly evil one here the relationships between the characters and the vivid portrayal of each of them brings this story to life you can feel what each character is feeling there is nothing more sad than the loss of a child and for a young boy to lose his only brother it is easy to feel young jess's pain the sheriff clem barefield has suffered his own pain in the past and his story is interwoven with that of the halls adelaide lyle knows something is terribly wrong with the church and she does what she can to keep the evil from the children until she can't all these events lead up to an explosive ending that affects every character in this tale a beautifully written story by an amazing new storyteller that will haunt you for some time to come","597":"could it be that i was drawn to this book because the author is a cash i don't know if that's the case but i did enjoy it a lot cash is a great writer he did a fabulous job of using 3 different voices as narrators and when he used adelaide's voice i had to keep reminding myself that he was a male author i love a good southern book and this had all the flavor of one this book is heartbreaking and shocking on so many levels but was such a page turner for me a great first novel","598":" an atmospheric southern novel a land more kind than home in some ways reminded me of tom franklin's crooked letter crooked letter in its use of setting and dialogue to convey mood and character the plot moves fast starting with two brothers ages 9 and i think 11 who each see things they shouldn't have consequences are swift and devastating the story is told by 3 narrators the nine year old boy an old woman who's lived in the town almost all her life and seen a lot and the sheriff wiley cash does a superb job of weaving in the back stories and flashbacks seamlessly to provide a nuanced account of not only these few tragic days but also what's led up to them snakes crazy christians tragedy healing and perhaps even redemption this book has it all and you won't want to put it down plus it has a great title who can resist","599":" the book started off well with the voice of an elderly woman telling the story of her small town church and how it had been changed by an over zealous pastor the author did a good job of conjuring up the atmosphere of a remote setting and i was intrigued by the religious sect he described however as the story moved along at an excruciatingly slow pace it only uncovered a thin plot line and frustrating characters who were not fully developed the book just didn't live up to my expectations","600":"beautiful story told from several perspectives i especially liked the little boy's perspective and thought the author did a good job of conveying the mystery of the inexplicable adult world from a child's perspective i also loved the beauty of the north carolina mountains through this child's eyes the author infuses this murder mystery with background about family and connections in rural communities helping us to see that when two men in this small town confront each other they are joined by their daddies and grand daddies even if just in spirit there is a great deal of sadness in this book the people who inflict the most pain on each other are often those who are supposed to love each other and while some of the characters are consumed by their past as well as their inherited past others find a way to somehow turn things around and get back on a good path surprising everyone around them","601":"a land more kind than home is a riveting story set in a small town in north carolina i couldn't put this book down i guess my final feeling was god bless the child","602":"glad my book club picked this i would never have read it otherwise the title and even the author suggest that it may be a western it's not although in genre sense it fits into the cowboy mold there's a good guy sheriff bad guys zealous pastor and a town drunk naively trusting woman a climactic event and the fallout i liked the format which tells the tale through different characters' viewpoints the story unfolds in an attention grabbing way my favorite character is jess an 8 year old boy i was a little disappointed with the end that is the actual last couple paragraphs at the end otherwise it's a well done book and a good read","603":"we read this for book club and i almost didn't read it i am glad that i did although it is not a happy tale it was fascinating to read about the lengths that people will go to follow their faith i was incredibly sad for the main character a young boy but i liked the writer's style and thought the book was a good read","604":"i enjoyed this novel for the most part the portrayal of the people of marshall and their lives is true and touching i'm still thinking about the ending though it is what it must be but it still disturbs me i'm looking forward to meeting wiley cash at bookmarks movable feast in february","605":"a wonderful read","606":"i loved this book made my weekend a couple months ago","607":"very absorbed in this story so far","608":"i really enjoyed every minute of reading this book finished it with tears in my eyes which is for me a signal that i have been brought to that moment for a reason","609":"i listened to the audio","610":" i was a little torn between 2 or 3 stars but i think it's that i wanted to like it more than i did the story is set nearby and i have researched the local snake handling religions myself so i was curious to read this i think cash could be a pretty good writer he has an easy style for the most part and there's just something likable about his tone however this one smacks of being his very first book i know he must have labored over it but i hope over time he'll learn to be more objective and critical of his writing before the final edit i would be rolling along with the story and then get so hung up on the non story items so often that it would bug me he is in the bad habit of being repetitive as well as contradicting himself when he gets carried away early on i remember a scene where the boys are peeking in the church windows and every few moments we hear again about the hot air blowing across something then when they are spying the a c is too loud to hear anything when that seems to be a handy descriptive reference right up until it's not that handy and they can magically hear what they need to cash will make you roll your eyes at times and wish for more meat often but i have hope for him this story is told from 3 view points a boy a woman and a man strangely he is better as the woman than the man but i thought most readable though strangely not necessarily believable at least not age appropriate as the boy i was let down by the ending but mostly by wanting more substance maybe more digging in and fewer voices for his 2nd book would be a good idea i would be willing to try him again in a few years","611":"while trying to decide between three stars or four i let clem barefield talk me into four his narrative voice was the strongest his story of his son's death and jimmy hall's part in it was beautifully told addie lyle was also an interesting narrator but i have to admit i found myself wondering why we heard as much of her back story as we did when jess narrated i really felt i could hear the child but his story broke my heart","612":"i loved this book the character description made it easy to see these people interacting with one another i never saw the ending coming","613":"brutal fiction about a special needs child who meets tragedy in the mountains of western north carolina plenty of cultural dialog on religious zealotry hypocrisy and the forces that drive small communities","614":"such a good story with vivid characters telling a tragic tale it was hard to put down","615":"a great story told from three points of view southern fiction at it's finest if wiley cash keeps it up like this then he has an amazing future ahead of him i'm looking forward to the next one","616":"i enjoyed this book really comes close to achieving greatness","617":"really all those stars peeps to me so so i've read a lot better with similar themes","618":"i read this novel in one sitting which i haven't done for a long time it's a dark tragic piece of southern literary suspense that i couldn't put down the author makes the small nc town and characters truly come alive i thought the alternating narrators added depth to the story by giving us bits u0026amp pieces that otherwise would have been lost","619":" i truly enjoyed the writing in this book the story revolves around the death of stump a mute perhaps autistic boy who dies during an evangelical healing three narrators tell the tale of life in this town and the ties that exist or are broken the near retirement sheriff who doesn't really want to see much more stump's younger brother jess who is trying to cope with his brother's death and wonders if he is somehow responsible and adelaide lyle an elderly woman who came down from the mountain many years ago at the core of the tragedy is the evangelical preacher who has too many of the townspeople in his thrall including stump's mother some readers have complained this novel moves to slowly yet i thought i did not get enough of these three characters and their voices of the three adelaide is perhaps the weakest voice but still an important one this is a story with a tragic trajectory with very believable humans i was never bored or felt that the plot moved too slowly this is not a plot driven story cash does a great job of getting into the hearts of his three narrators","620":"i only finished reading this book because of my book club i was turned off from the beginning with the snake handling church i am not sure if the author could have made this book more interesting with deeper development of the characters but it seemed to just skim over any details i would have loved to know more about ben and what happened to him and also to his father what happened to him all those years he was away it was a quick read but not a favorite book of mine","621":" i like stories set in the south especially nc but i didn't find this to be suspenseful and a lot of it didn't mesh together for me i know what the author was aiming for but i felt he either overreached his goal or missed it completely i love the cultural elements of it the old lady who grew up in the mountains the folklore of healing but the character of the pastor was never fully explained and the mother in the story was just a shadow i'd like to know more about her and her motivations and because you know why the death happens right from the start it all feels anticlimactic","622":"whoa this book when i first read the review it sounded interesting but i didn't like the cover then when i needed to read the book for a committee oh gosh i am soooooo glad i did it's a heartbreaker for sure but i fell in love with the characters and you're left with a little bit of hope at the end beautiful","623":"appalachian literature has had its good and bad periods but perhaps wiley cash's first novel bodes well for the region's fiction as well as for the author cash's story is a bit of a whodunit a bit suspense with a whole lot of appalachian culture and color in a literary novel the author tells the story in three voices jess hall - a young boy whose parents are going through a never ending rough patch clem barefield a local sheriff and adelaide lyle an old woman jaded by age and things hidden in local people's souls but the story jess' brother christopher called stump is a mute and meets a mysterious end while in the hands of a local preacher as with many southern tales the boy's death doesn't end there - it causes a stir of the kind one might only find in such communities reminiscent of james dickey's deliverance the story is paced well doled out in these three voices and calculated to have the reader turn the next page time after time if i find any fault with the story it's two fold *tthat jess's voice sometimes seems childlike at others almost too adult too aware in an adult sense still cash covers his writerly tracks well and it hardly detracts from the story's telling *tas the story progresses barefield confront the preacher in what seems an out of character almost milquetoast way again the story's the thing and it hardly detracts the book is the stuff of southern writing - and southern movies cash would seem to have a promising future before him","624":"set in the mountains near asheville cash captures the feel of a small town through the eyes of his characters as tragedy unfolds having made it through the first chapter after my own run in with a copperhead i really enjoyed his book i am looking forward to his next due out in jan","625":"a tragic story but so moving and thought provoking a part of our country and culture i wasn't familiar with a very enjoyable read","626":"3 5 really decent 1st novel wish we could have had ben and julie's povs also end fizzled for me","627":"having grown up in nc not the mountains i loved this book my dad's side of the family were country folks and lived a lot like these people as well as growing up there was a family that lived down the street that reminded me of jess and his family the story and characters were believable and kept me turning the pages it was a sad book and the ending wasn't what i had hoped for honestly i should have known how it would end based on the vision of the characters","628":" at a holiness church in a rural appalachian town a healing service for a mute 13 year old boy goes horribly wrong the story is narrated by three characters the boy's younger brother the town's sheriff and a church member who is critical of the charismatic preacher with a dubious past the initial chapters drew me quickly into the story and set a vivid tone but i felt that it lost momentum as it progressed the three voices began to meld in tone too many idiosyncrasies were not addressed for example an abusive alcoholic father reappears after 10 years and is a wholesome grandfather who can drink in moderation and is immediately trusted by his adult son but there is no explanation for this transformation meanwhile other details of scenery or other back stories that have no bearing on the story are well developed the ending left me unsatisfied","629":"i did not expect it to end the way it did the blurb made me think that this was a whodunnit but it is not we know and do not know what happened and that doesn't matter in the end the story is more a description of some people's reactions to an event and it's written quite well i'm also quite partial to it because it's set in the mountains of nc though i've never been to madison county i don't think","630":"ok not sure it was necessarily as good as publisher's spring book talk hyped it","631":"i loved this debut novel set in the mountains of western nc the story is told by three narrators the sheriff an old mountain healer midwife and a 9 year old boy the story centers around a small church led by a pastor who is suspect they speak in tongues handle snakes eat poison etc at his direction makes you wonder how people fall for such religions the death of the little boy's brother is central to everything that follows in this tragic but moving story a great read","632":"good pain violence and lil bits of redemption everything you want in your southern gothic writing felt a little simple at times but the character voices felt honest definitely an engaging read","633":"loved this novel cash writes in the tradition of southern fiction i think and i loved most of the characters in this book despite their brokenness in part about the problems with christian zealotry and following christian leaders blindly no matter where they go","634":"i loved this book the voice of time and place was so clear as well as the characters it is hard to believe this was a debut novel but after reading his essay why i write about north carolina it became clear i look forward to taking another journey with mr cash to the mountains","635":"a splendid first novel effective use of character narrations imaginative plot developments southern gothic in many ways","636":"wiley cash what a great name has done such a good job here the voices are wonderfully true and the story keeps you turning pages some problems in the conclusion a bit over the top i thought and that weakened it still i loved the characters and personally i loved being in this land so close to home","637":"i felt this book was a little slow moving and depressing what a bummer after reading some the reviews i was expecting something more what exactly i couldn't say but this definitly fell short of my expectations however i did enjoy the southern dialect this book reminded me a lot of the rapture of canaan by sheri reynolds","638":"great book well written with interesting characters really enjoyed it","639":"unusual plot that brought out a topic that was new for me there is a very fine line between religion and cult","640":"at first i found this book a bit disturbing with the quirky beliefs and actions that pastor chambliss has i even thought of stopping after 50 pages because it didn't sound right but i'm glad i kept reading because after reading this book i got something beautiful and precious out of it i understood why the author wrote this book it has a purpose not only i love this book it is naturally a page turner i'm looking forward to read his other book this dark road to mercy","641":"this is the most beautifully written book i've read in a long long time the characters are so well drawn that i would not be surprised if they appeared on my front porch this is especially notable in the protaganist 9 year old jess even though i've finished the book i still want to hug and comfort him the work reminded my of barbara kingsolver's early book","642":"his writing is lyrical and captures the cadence and rhythms of the mountains splendid","643":"i could not put this down well written great characters heavy topic loved it","644":" this sounds like a backhanded compliment but i don't mean it to be it was surprising to me how easily a land more kind than home could've gone wrong and how it never ever did by which i mean that i've read no shortage of hicksploitation narratives stories and novels that use rural folks as their protagonists without fully understanding those characters that have tried and failed to accomplish what cash seems to do so effortlessly one of the things that works so well is cash's decision to use multiple pov characters to tell this story especially because the story is a complicated one there are multiple deaths infidelity backwoods snake handling the works the book jacket likens cash's writing to cormac mccarthy though i'm not quite sure that's it cash isn't nearly as sparse or non emotive as mccarthy and there are plenty of occasions where the heartstrings are pulled masterfully here o'connor seems a closer comparison though that doesn't quite capture it either i'll contentedly describe cash's voice as wholly his own i've read books for plenty of dubious reasons but this one might be the most my brother sat next to the author on an airplane and then told me to pick up his book i'm glad he did there's plenty to recommend here a page turner that asks the reader to luxuriate over the lines","645":"i wanted to like this book more than i did i appreciated the feeling of the south and the questions that the book raises about religion forgivenss and family i just wanted a more original stoy","646":"story is just a bit depressing there is a glimmer of hope at the end shows how people can be such followers rather than thinking and processing thoughts events and ideas setting was so authentic probably comes down a bit hard on charismatic religious leaders tongue in cheek while writing this i would recommend this definitely has a flavor of its own","647":"really glad that i grabbed this off the new books shelf at the library well written great characters my favorite was jess and descriptive to the point you felt like you were in rural nc","648":"this is one terrific debut novel set in the rural mountains of north carolina the main character is a 9 year old boy who while spying with his brother sees some things that set in motion a series of tragic events what a well told story and total page turner it's a great example of how a misguided charismatic religious leader can wreak havoc on a whole community","649":"a great summer read loved this story","650":"north carolina author wiley cash nails the characters of western nc in this novel about a young boy in snake handling church country of madison county it was a good read","651":"it had good potential but just ended up being sad sad sad","652":"this was a very powerful and very rough read definitely worth a try if you're from the area and are interested in local storytelling bat shit crazy religion and or a good cry","653":"grim but beautifully written","654":"told by 3 storytellers jess a young boy adelaide the town midwife and sheriff clema story of how religeon can be a good or evil thing in a small town","655":" wiley cash has written a story so impressive that you hope there is another book that comes out of his creative genius very soon the story is told through three characters living in the backwoods of nc about 50 years ago a church is the center of this tale one that would seem unbelieveable today because it is based on healing with snakes and other physical attempts at deliverance from evil when a child dies because of the beliefs in the church it is then that the reader learns of the past through these characters and how their lives revolve around this small community of nc it is a must read","656":"this is a beautifully written story i enjoyed it very much and not just because i enjoy reading in a southern accent there's very little excess here in the way of character development but you feel you know them all intimately the descriptions of the landscape and scenes however are striking and paint vivid backdrops for the story","657":" wiley cash's first novel is a winner right out of the starting gate the way he weaves the story through the perspective of three different characters is wonderfully woven this book is reminiscent to me of to kill a mockingbird although i don't know if that's due to the book's setting or the chapters of the book told by jess hill the young boy in the novel i can't say enough positive things about this story the first page grabs you and doesn't let go until the end although i stayed awake until after midnight on a work night to finish this novel it was well worth it to me if his future stories continue with the same eloquence and skill with character development i think i've discovered a new favorite author","658":"great first book keep writing wiley cash rural north carolina fanatic religion life and death and everything in between","659":" from the back cover a haunting tale of courage in the face of cruelty and the power of love to overcome the darkness that lives in all of us in my opinion not exactly cash's first novel is beautifully written with strong characterization and there are plenty of tragedies in this medium length novel however i felt that the ending was too abrupt and somewhat contrived i enjoyed the setting the mountains of western north carolina i do feel that cash has potential as an author and i will look for his next book","660":" what an excellent debut novel all the characters in this story were fully developed and while it is told in alternating perspectives you never get the slightest bit confused about who is talking because they each have their own unique distinct perspective my personal favorite was adelaide i would read a stand alone novel about her she had such a unique and interesting story and way of thinking about the world all in all a great novel that shows you how the past can always come back to haunt your future","661":"mercy this is dark favorite part is the epitaph from thomas wolfe's you can't go home again because honestly sometimes a body just gets tired of it all something has spoken to me in the night and told me i shall die i know not where saying death is to lose the earth you know for greater knowing to lose the life you have for greater life to leave the friends you loved for greater loving to find a land more kind than home more large than earth","662":"easy book to read telling a story from many characters point of view book about nc mountain people and their evangelical church and a crime","663":" a land more kind than home is the story of the hall family's falling apart after the horrifying death of a child told through the points of view of the sheriff church school teacher and the child's brother i read this book in a couple of sittings wiley cash captures the different narrators' voices well and allows the story to develop through their eyes this however left me feeling a disconnect with the other characters i wanted to know more about them to better understand how they got to be where they were and their motivations all that aside though i highly recommend this book for a quick compelling summer read","664":"this is fiction that doesn't disappoint i just couldn't square the story with the time it seemed as though it should have been set in the 30's or 40's but maybe that's the way that part of nc is lost in time","665":"this is the author's first novel and it is a quick read quick because you don't want to put it down however if you have a strong fear of snakes don't pick this up interesting characters and good writing made me wish it was longer","666":"this book got rave reviews but i thought it was really really slow and not the good way where you can still appreciate things i was just bored the whole time","667":"really good book read it in two days grabs me and love how it is told from different points of view would make a great movie","668":"this book was so well written and so sad such a tragic story but i couldn't put it down highly recommend this one","669":"great first novel having grown up in the south i recognize these people and am even more grateful for the safe passage from those belief systems moving story of learning truth and when to tell it","670":"what a wonderful book the story is beautifully written and is a page turner i look forward to more books by wiley cash","671":"wiley cash has an ear and appreciation for the part of western nc he portrays it never felt cliche or like a caricature i could hear people i know in their voice without feeling like it was trite or forced jess might be one of my favorite characters ever my only complaint the book was too short i could have followed the aftermath of this tragedy further i wanted more on stump christopher ben and grandpa","672":"such a beautiful dense southern gothic it took me just two sentences to live in this book to see the gorgeous characters and the and their weird little town his language is incredibly lyrical and his vision of religious obsession just frightening it's a shame wiley cash loses his grasp on the story in the end for one i'm not sure i quite agree with his message about religion but that's very subjetive anyway what i really disliked though was the not very subtle way in which it is conveyed in the very last chapter the denouement of the story takes place a little earlier and that too fell short for me it just wasn't clever enough for the grandness of the rest of the story but the way there is just mesmerizing if you like southern gothic twin peaks carnivale or just atmosphere in general you'll probably love this book","673":"i would have given this book five stars had it not been for the ending i hated the ending cash could have taken it in a direction that worked much better in my opinion he is however an excellent story teller and i'll definitely be reading more of his work when he writes another novel i loved jess i loved adelaide i loved clem read the book so we can talk about the ending together will you","674":"nine year old jess sees something he shouldn't the faith healing ceremony for his older brother at his mother's church his fear keeps him quiet and sets off events that will destroy his family told from jess' perspective as well as that of the town's sheriff and also long time resident adelaide has a to kill a mockingbird feel with strong characters and evocative of place","675":"a land more kind than home was a thoughtful lyrical read so packed with action i found myself torn between wanting to reread passages and tear through pages i am not sure which voice was my favorite each was so distinct and will remain with me always","676":"ok but don't believe the cover blub that it is a modern day to kill a mockingbird","677":" this is a first novel from a young writer from north carolina it is a small town appalachian story told by three narrators a young boy the town midwife and the sheriff and there is a small spirit filled country church called river road church of christ in signs following where snake handling and holy ghost power turn up the tempo trouble ensues bad stuff happens this story is well written and riveting downright scary in places perhaps one lesson to be taken from this tale of woe is not to be holding secrets and information that impacts the lives of others and yourself as well but when you're a child fear and lack of understanding govern a lot of your decisions that involve the bad adults around you somewhat aside from the narrative there were two new pieces of information that i received in the course of this tale the first involves the use of the placenta after childbirth in this story the self trained country midwife helps deliver a baby and then advises the father to boil the afterbirth into a tea for his wife assuring him that it will be good for her i had never heard about this use of the placenta so i researched a bit and found that most mammals in the world eat the placenta including many primates all except the majority of humans so there must be a good reason right the placenta is rich in nutrients and hormones consider that it has been the lifeline between the mother and developing child and some midwives and \"earth mothers\" believe that eating it can help with problems from postpartum bleeding to postpartum depression the placenta is high in progesterone and has a small amount of oxytocin the drug that is usually administered after birth to help stop bleeding and help seal up the uterus where it was attached the placenta is nature's source for this helpful substance evidently it is considered best to eat it raw in small sliced pieces for maximum hemorrhage prevention it is also considered helpful for the production of mother's milk for postpartum depression the placenta can be consumed raw over a period of time by cutting it into bite size pieces and then freezing them while fresh and then taking them out of the freezer a few at a time when the 'blues' hit or it can be ground up and kept well refrigerated until used in drinks or powdered form placenta has also been used as a remedy for anemia all very interesting the second new piece of information is about \"petechiae\" a medical term new to me they are tiny red dots caused by bleeding under the skin from broken blood vessels blood rushes to the skin and presents as ugly red spots and blotches it can be caused by hard coughing crying or vomiting especially if someone has a problem with their air supply and breathing while doing so very unsightly this was a sad story and wiley cash did a good job telling it","678":"i would rate this at 41 2 stars if i could a couple of reservations prevent my giving it 5 stars but overall this was very good suspenseful well written and emotionally riveting","679":"not quite a 4 star but very very close it was hard to put down this is an excellent beginning for this author the characters are vivid and i can almost hear the stream in the background as the children play outside the church fast read with characters that quickly draw you in i would recommend this to anybody","680":"first book for this 2012 author what a story told by 3 people an old lady of the church the younger brother and the town cop it's about boys' spying on things they shouldn't be seeing like an adulturous relationship involving one of their moms and the spiritual healing practices of a weird southern church the story deals with death and relationships and family and forgiveness it's amazing","681":" i would have given this novel 2 stars from an enjoyment perspective but i begrudgingly gave it 3 stars because it was quite well written as a cancer survivor i feel i have had about enough darkness in my life and don't really need any more from fiction i knew there would be dark themes but i was hopeful that there would be more redemption and hopefulness in the end basically a charlatan preacher held sway over vulnerable people in the mountains of north carolina in that the theme was something of a cliche and even somewhat offensive to this southerner i did not enjoy this novel and would not recommend it to others","682":"sad book life turned cruel for young jess and his brother stump a novel rich in religion and its potency when it dominates your very existence redemption in the end for some of the characters but it came with a price recommend this book author understands the people and landscape of this rural north carlolina community","683":"snakes and church was reading this on a saturday night before i went to bed the next morning as i sat in our beautiful sanctuary i was so thankful nothing was slithering","684":"wow great book for those who love characters over plot perhaps a touch heavy on the dialect from time to time but not much and not too distraction it's not until close to the end that you know who the story is truly about not a surprise but not who would initially think","685":"does the writer for the richmond times dispatch who says this book reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's to kill a mockingbird know how to read while cash does a decent job of telling a story his prose lacks poetic presence and his use of language is as common as what one reads on the back of a cereal box no quotable moments no transports of language no poignant insights as the story goes it has all the qualities of a typical narrative a beginning middle and end even an interesting climax if you like the way a lifetime movie unfolds but in all it lacks any invention but what annoys me most about this novel is that on some levels it highjacks a culture only to remind us of the stereotypes associated with said culture back woods bible beating preacher snake handling believers ignorant followers and meth makers add to that shout outs to sundrops homes that only recently added indoor plumbing darkened hollers and alcoholic fathers then i'd say you have a novel set in western north carolina or err really the basis for the story comes from an actual incident that occurred in milwaukee when a church tries to heal a boy with autism the child dies while being healed and the death is ruled a homicide but who would believe that something like that could happen in milwaukee retell the tale in the appalachian mountains and it becomes plausible fiction i'm not saying that stereotypes have no roots of truth it's just that sometimes those roots are so tenuous gossamer even yet captured in the right sort of print they take hold like kudzu and choke out everything around it unlike other regional writers such as ron rash or silas house cash's rendering of mountain culture seems forced and unaware lastly i'm not surprised this was a nyt notable book last year it seems those reviewers are always looking for a resurrection of faulkner or o'connor a resurrection of some dark tale that can only unwind in the south and while it may be true that the past is never dead it's not even past\" a good writer has an eye in the present and conveys place with a fresh understanding of even old ideas this i think is something cash needs to learn he does have potential as a storyteller but maybe he needs to explore the cracks in the sidewalks of the piedmont and stop imagining what's really in those hills to the west p s i may be overly harsh here he seems like a nice fellow i saw cash speak not too long ago and he is witty and charming and his next book may be better","686":"not what i expected but better good sad characters in the south explosive ending","687":"this debut novel is an extraordinary work by a brilliant writer listen to my interview with the talented wiley cash may 29th may 29 3 p m et on the halli casser jayne show talk radio for fine minds http bit ly u4eemd","688":" reviewers are praising this book from an unknown author to the skies the leisurely paced writing tells a disturbing story from multiple perspectives the story centers on a group of extreme southern christian fundamentalists and a convict who leads them woven throughout however are other stories of a mother's hope for healing for her son an adult man's angst over his relationship with his father the influence of alcohol on each generation loss compassion fate and redemption this is a new southern story teller","689":"i thought it was overrated the comparison to to kill a mockingbird was awfully fabulous for the writer i'm sure but didn't even come close only 1 of the 3 narrators were sympathetic characters and the boy jess's voice was not quite convincing it was one of those books where every detail is drawn out 5 pages might take up ten minutes of time okay so i exaggerate but not one of my favorites and not memorable","690":"it was better than i thought it would be the story was based on the life of a slave that came to america by boat from africa her trials were many but end in the end she gained her freedom the story was very stirring about slavery and all they endured","691":"great book this book was so rich in characters and they were well written the story was well written and kept you reading to see what happened this is a story of secrets and the cost of keeping them","692":"library book overall excellent work but did not like the sense that the mother was a sympathetic character when she was clearly doing wrong from the beginning dad was somehow turned into the bad guy over night the actions if not the thought process of jess was extremely frustrating","693":"other reviewers have described this book as captivating and i can't think of a better word than that i was enthralled from the beginning and would have stayed up all night to finish it if i hadn't had plans the next day the first person narration from three different characters was an effective way to give different perspectives on the same events as well as to allow us to learn some of the back stories from those characters too cash has an ear for the dialect north carolina appalachia so all the notes ring true just a beautiful enchanting novel i can hardly wait for his next","694":" it's amazing what expectations can do to your enjoyment of a book if i hadn't heard and read so many rave reviews i'd probably be giving this a 4 but when you start a book that's been touted as the next to kill a mockingbird well there's pretty much no where to go but down that being said i did enjoy the book and i do recommend it the multiple voices work well to tell the story and the story is a good one no doubt cash is a gifted new voice and i look forward to reading more from him in the future he also has an exceptional undertanding of place","695":"engrossing setting fascinating characters story about what happens when a charismatic preacher's secretive practices run amok the only thing i would have liked more of is more development on what made the characters tick the bad guy was so horrible but what was going on behind that and what was it about him that was so charismatic exactly but maybe the ambiguity was sort of the point could be","696":"through the eyes of a 10 year old elderly midwife and sheriff we expeience life as it unfolds in the hill country of north carolina wiley cash did a superb job bringing this story to life remnds me of sharon mccrumb's songcatcher a book i read years ago looking forward to reading his next book","697":" this book hooked me from the first page and i simply could not put it down i lost sleep while reading this book and to me the mark of something good is how heavy the bags under your eyes are i liked the premise of the three narrators and their voices were different enough but i did find them all blending together near the end i love books that tend to focus on losing one's individuality ability to think for oneself and that theme continued to surprise me throughout the novel great dialect too","698":"this was an excellent first novel totally engaging","699":"i was looking for something that wasn't a mystery or upsetting this was not the book for that really liked it however and will be thinking about adelaide and jess for a long time","700":"i loved this book can't wait to read more by mr cash","701":"best book i've read for adults this year i don't know what took me so long to read it but i'm kind of glad i waited although i loathe fanatical religion and the evils that usually accompany i am riveted to the subject especially when snakes and tongues are involved it didn't hurt that i read this book in the mountains of nc which are near and dear to my heart wiley cash is an amazing new young author one that i will be on the lookout for","702":"our book club read this i thought that it had potential but dragged in parts i liked it better than anyone else in our group","703":" i just finished a land more kind than home it is written by wiley cash it's about a mute boy who's killed in a church everybody tries to make sense of what happened and why the story line is told in three different points of view the boy's sunday school teacher his brother and the town's sheriff it goes into a lot of back stories that leads up to the main story at hand i personally really enjoyed this book it moved me deeply i fully recommend anybody read it i highly doubt anybody won't be as moved by this book as i was i was especially moved hearing it from the brother's point of view it was very touching to get it from that angle wiley cash was pure genius when he thought of doing it from that perspective","704":"i really enjoyed this absorbing tale of small town southern america religion and families long held sadnesses and belonging","705":"the pull of a religious doctrine is the bottom line if this story loved the style of writing as a narrative from multiple people's point if view","706":"this book began with such promise but the final quarter of the book went downhill for me","707":"for a first novel this book was amazing mr cash kept it all together perfectly i was truly impressed at first i kind of cringed because i thought it was going to be about religious snake handlers but it soon switched to a very interesting story with many key characters the climax was a little bloody but the story ended on an upbeat note","708":"i found it hard to believe a book this well written was a first novel the writing was so evocative of the time and the place i think if you didn't know at least a little something about snake handling in some southern religions you might miss a little of what is happening at first i recommend they shall take up serpents by weston labarre if you want to explore that topic i did find this book a little slow going at first but then it grabbed me and wouldn't let me go","709":"simple language well executed perfect cast of characters not too overloaded and a fine balance among them led me through what really felt like a mellow drama but had so much more going on within it looking forward to reading more of cash's work","710":"reminds us of to kill a mockingbird vivid characters in a small town summer as claustrophobic as a darkened church lives dangerously entwined beginning and ending","711":"i think i would have enjoyed this more as an audio not available through my library i got distracted the vernacular which might not be true listening","712":"this book was a compelling read that left me asking questions about what will happen now for the characters they were quite believable even though the situation in which they evolve seems outrageous to me it also left me with questions about religious practices that are so far from the main stream but are still practiced what are these people thinking my book club with be skyping with the author in february and i have a slew of questions for him i can't wait to hear what he has to say","713":"a great first novel it's the story of two young brothers and the evil they face in a small north caroling town it's told from the viewpoint of three people jess the nine year old younger brother adelaide the town midwife and it's moral conscience and clem the local sheriff the characters are vivid the setting is believable and the plot is mesmerizing","714":"well written too sad for my personal tastes excellent imagery and dialogue makes you feel like you are with the characters suffering alongside them and their personal tragedies heartbreaking this one will stay with me for a while","715":" a beautiful first novel by a writer born in north carolina wiley cash it is a story of three generations of the hall family who live in western north carolina and the people who intersect their lives adelaide lyle the town midwife sheriff clem barefield and the one person who plays a defining role in all their lives carson chambliss the preacher a preacher who speaks in tongues who tests god will to rid people of evil by having them confront poisonous snakes and who papers over the windows of his church so no one not attending his service can be aware of what transpires inside but the book is mostly the story of jess hall the son of bill and julie hall and grandson of jim hall but it is the reverend who sets the story in motion jess is very protective of his older brother christopher who is a mute and nicknamed 'stump ' and it is what happens to stump that will either bring the community of marshall closer together or forever divide it the book is divided into sections each highlighting one of the main players while still bringing the story forward it is a fascinating look at a part of our culture that is often ignored in today's fast paced electronic existence it is wonderfully written book that makes it easy to predict the author's continued success","716":"i had mixed feelings about this one there are three narrators two of which worked their magic on me the third the female narrator not at all i was also bother by the rushed ending and my worry about the mom and her relatioship with jess not going to spoil anything but it felt incomplete to me","717":"i liked the southern setting of this book that was a new thing for me and you had to like the characters to almost feel protective of them but the snake handling church felt too drastic to me like a pull for my attention i don't like being dragged around by my emotions and the story wound and twisted in a way that made me impatient not my favorite","718":" i maybe shouldn't have started another southern book so soon after finishing the homecoming of samuel lake which swept me off my feet and gave me a heck of a book hangover there were times i was really into this story then it would cut back to the past and talk about something else which was somewhat related to the story being told but took me out of the present story if you are a follower of my reviews you know i like a story that goes back and forth in time but this one seemed to do it without warning and took me a bit to catch up the zealous religion in this one reminded me of rapture of canaan by sheri reynolds the pastor is not a good man and is pretty much a psychopath it had me thinking the old saying \"lord save me from your followers \"there actually wasn't many likable characters in this book because everyone seemed to be hiding something and when the big no spoilers came i would have done the same thing as ben did and didn't feel one bit sorry for the other parties my problem with the characters was if even one person who knew the truth had spoke up would events have been different i am not talking just jess either the midwife too if you read her first section what if she had told the truth then this is a very sad book without a happy ending and as i've said in other reviews i like a hea even if it's just some kind of redemption and this book didn't really have that or a conclusion i felt like jess was left hanging at the end and am curious about his relationship with his mother as he got older this was a good story nothing really groundbreaking but a good well written story none the less and i would read other books by this author the narration by lorna raver mark bramhall u0026amp nick sullivan was very well done and they embodied the voice of each characters perfectly if you are looking for a happy story this ain't it but if you want a well told story about the dangers of believing that some crazy snake charmer is a man of god then you'll enjoy this one 3  1\/2  stars","719":"in simple straight forward style he is able to bring to life the characters even some of the minor characters i would just have ended the book a little differently since i think all religions are just currently accepted mythologies","720":"this new southern author has created a very well written story with a strong sense of place and believable characters i especially enjoyed the three points of view although not christian fiction there's a strong theme of faith and of what happens when people lose faith follow charlatans or allow the christian message to be subverted it would make a good discussion book i think","721":" this was a great book--the main story is about stump a mute boy whose mother's snake handling pastor decides to heal as you might imagine this does not turn out well the story is told from the perspective of stump's younger brother jess the town sheriff clem and long time local addie who left the pastor's church long before the story started this is an appalachian story and the characters' language seems pitch perfect they are also more complicated and interconnected than they appear at first glance the main plot is absorbing but so are the undercurrents there are a number of narrator flashbacks that are well placed and timed they flesh the characters out and therefore the underlying themes and subplots without interrupting the general pace of the plot so glad i picked this one up thanks to npr's lesser known jewels list","722":"the problem with me reading an e book is that i don't check to see how much of the book i have left so sometimes the ending catches me completely by surprise that is what i felt with this book i enjoyed the characters lyle jess the sheriff and their stories i hated chambliss the villain and eventually julie too i couldn't put it down but i felt the characters the writing and the reader deserved a better more thorough ending we needed to hear from each of the characters not just lyle and the ending about the church seemed a little silly and stiff i wanted to hear that after 10 years of evil and ill spent faith that the building had been burnt down and rebuilt or at least completely remodeled i wanted to hear that the misguided towns folk had learned an important lesson about snake charmers and secrets behind taped up windows i wanted to hear that jess' grandpa wasn't drinking and that jim bills brother scooter and clay had gotten the tar beat out of them by tuned in parents i know it couldn't and shouldn't end all happily ever after but we should have at least had one more wrap it up chapter by each of the characters especially jess","723":"oh wow what a find what a great read i was desperately searching for a book in the st louis airport where i was facing a 3 hour layover only to realize i had already read the book i brought with me on the trip i had never heard of this book but bought it strictly from the words across the front cover stating that it was a ny times bestseller and then from the short blurb on its back cover i scored on this purchase and had almost devoured it by the time we landed at our destination it's set in rural north carolina and had me spellbound from the first page to the very last sentence a must read","724":" ahh what a story what a story a land more kind than home is a contemporary southern story about the power that some people weld it's told through the three perspectives of jess a 9 year old boy clem the local sherriff and addie a local healer and elderly spinster bad things have occurred in the nearby church and addie realizes that she didn't do enough to prevent it jess is caught in the middle as he tries to protect his older brother stump but finds himself in the middle of events that he doesn't quite understand clem must fight through his own tragedy and solve the new tragic mystery all the characters search for answers while reflecting on past events in their lives it is only jess who knows the truth but he isn't old enough to see it for what it is oh how i enjoyed this book i found the southern setting to be both charming and authentic i also loved the writing style which created a mesmerizing simple tale each voice stood out and i felt i could hear the characters in my hear oh so clearly this story is wonderful because it is unveiled in such a magical and engrossing way it isn't quite a mystery the reader quickly recognizes the coming issues and knows how the events unfolded however the characters are unaware and we follow jess addie and clem as they search for answers and the events unfold overall you can finish this book in one sitting easily it's easy to fly through it's the kind of book that you don't think you'll love but the writing is so spectacular that it picks you up and sets you down in a small town and it makes you love it even if the description doesn't rock your boat you should read it anyway it is poetic and easy","725":"3 75 rating i've finally despite my rural setting gotten enough women together for a book club - and this novel was chosen for our first discussion in late march with its fanatical preacher chambliss and the personification of churches as living breathing things it's sure to elicit quite a bit of conversation i can't wait a southern novel set in a rural north carolina town wiley cash's debut is told in alternating first person voices an old midwife named adelaide lyle a nine year old boy called jess hall and sheriff clem barefield i have to confess that the story came to life most for me during clem's chapters and his personal story i had some difficulty relating with the young narrator a tragic accident is at the center of this novel interestingly it is stated at the very beginning of the book so that there is no wonder about what big event will happen to transform the characters the reader spends the remainder of the book learning the backstory behind that fateful day and how the characters are tied to it the surprise comes during the quickly paced ending as it ties back to the beginning chapters and effectively concludes the book with some heart thumping action father son relationships are key throughout this novel - not just in the religious sense - and i thought cash handled the parallels of various father son relationships with great skill one of the key themes of the story is summed up by clem \"...i couldn't keep from thinking about how unfair it would be ... but since then i've learned to just go ahead and take fairness out of the equation if you do things stand the chance of making a whole lot more sense \" this story brought back some memories of my own upbringing in a rural church in pennsylvania the good and the bad it was a reminder of the power behind religious belief not in a preachy self rightheous way this novel did an excellent job of showing both the good and the evil sides of organized religion great for discussion","726":"i loved cash's prose it seems effortless and authentic and i liked the characters but the book ended far too abruptly i think it left me wanting more for from the narrators","727":" this was my north carolina book for the around the us in 52 books challenge it takes place near asheville brief synopsis this is a story of a troubled family and a snake handling church and the way those two things intersect with tragic results it's told very effectively i thought from three different points of view one is a child one's an old woman and one is a middle aged man the stories overlap a bit but the 3 characters advance the plot at different times rather than giving competing views of the same events the book is not really a mystery you know the basic facts of what has happened early in the book but there is some suspense in wondering whether the main characters will learn all that the reader knows when they'll learn it and how they'll react but this is done in a relatively low key way with some very lovely turns of phrase","728":"loved this wiley cash is not ron rash cormac mccarthy yet but he'll get there one day","729":"brava wiley cash on your stunning debut a land more kind than home i surely hope that this is the beginning of a long and successful career for this writer it was hard for me to believe that this book was a debut from wiley cash it's not often that an authors first novel is as compelling and thought provoking and real and honest as a land more kind than home was this book stuck with me and i don't believe it did so because of my crippiling fear of all things snakes but i think it was more to do with mr cash's writing style and his ability to make the characters part of you this is the story of a dysfunctional farm family living in marshall north carolina there is a father who has lost his faith and it's a wonder he ever had any to begin with since his own father was an abusive drunk a filandering and naive mother who can't love her husband or her children because she is so blinded by her faith a son who has been mute and slow since he was born and another son who is at the beginning at least the only disaffected one of the bunch but don't worry that'll change by the end of the novel one day the two boys discover a secret that is held by their mother and the local pastor the mother and the two sons attend one of \"those\" pentecostal churches that used to be more common out in the nc mountains and georgia tennessee and west virginia too you know the kind that are based only around mark 16 17 18 \"and these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues 18 they will pick up snakeswith their hands and when they drink deadly poison it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands onsick people and they will get well \"during one church service a child dies and the book then begins to provoke thoughts on such things as is it right or wrong to have children in those dangerous services with poisionous snakes and strychnine swallowing is it murder if someone dies during a sermon was it the fault of a the brother who withheld information that could have prevented the child from even going into the church that day should the people of this religion be allowed to worship in this way or would revoking that right be revoking their freedom of religion i don't have all the answers to these questions and neither did cash and neither did any of the characters in his book that's what made the book so good and so authentic is that the characters didn't behave in a way that we wouldn't expect them to they were raw characters with real emotions and reactions to the events unfolding around them having grown up in western nc i believe that cash probably did what all great writers are told to do and that is \"write what you know \" it was not at all difficult for me to believe that this story is probably one that was very real and very close to cash and his upbringing i'm really glad that i checked this book out from the library at the same time i also checked out ron rash's the cove these two books were so close to each other both had a mute in them and both captured the feel and the setting of appalachian north carolina to a t my aunt happens to live in marshall north carolina and i love going to spend time up there i remember one summer when she pointed out some of the pentecostal churches in the area that practiced serpent handling and poison drinking i also remember meeting the people in the town and they are all just like the characters in this book as i was reading both books i found myself picturing the people that i had met there as the characters and the homes that i had been invited into there in marshall as the settings perhaps having spent a good deal of time in this area made the book pop more for me and made it seem more like it was actually happening instead of a work of fiction so would i recommend this book and the cove i absolutley do and in fact i'm going to e mail the moderator of my book club after i finish this post and let her know that i want to lead a discussion on a land more kind than home at one of our upcoming meetings the book has violence all through it and like i mentioned earlier ugghhh snakes i have a horrible paralyzing awful fear of snakes and there were a lot of dangerous ones in this book but the worst one of all is the pastor of the church i knew from the first time he was introduced that he was one bad dude and he only got worse as the book progressed do you remember that guy that started up a cult and then he convinced all of his followers that he was jesus christ and then he made them babies and all drink the kool aid yeah that was this guy just not on as big of a scale pastor carson chambliss ruined everything he touched including the church the town and an already struggling family don't get to frettin' none yet did i mention that i am also from north carolina not western coastal actually but nc all the same the book had some good in it too we are told this story through three narrators adelaide lyle who breaks from the church after the first yes there is more than one death and takes the children with her clem barefield the town sherrif who is trying to keep the peace of the town and marshall is such a peaceful little town and do justice and jess hall the \"normal\" boy in the family these three voices are honest and kind and good knowing that they want what is good and right to happen gives hope that there are angels and that not everyone is a devil like the pastor","730":" this book takes place back in the day of the hell and brimstone country church when the preacher portrayed himself as a god and all the sinners of the community were afraid to cross him there are a few key characters in this old fashioned story the 10 year old boy who witnesses a couple of things that he should not have seen and is afraid to tell anyone the old woman who has ministered all her medical knowledge love and support to the community whenever and where ever she is able and the country sheriff who tries to keep the community peaceful even when he himself has suffered tragic loss and there is the preacher who is so full of himself that he can't see the distruction he causes until it is too late this book is very fast paced it will make you tear up and then it may make you smile i would recommend it for a weekend of good reading","731":"a very well written book probably not the type of book i'd typically choose but a good story anyway worth a read","732":"great story set in north carolina a must read for nc folks i couldn't put it down","733":"i love a southern voice u0026amp this book did not disappoint lyrically written u0026amp a terrific story love the multiple points of view","734":"wiley cash is a fresh new voice speaking on behalf of things familiar to anyone raised in the south","735":"this was a 2 5 star book for me i sort of liked it it was sort of okay i enjoyed most of the characters and their dialogue inner and spoken i appreciated cultural point of view but it was just too dang depressing and disturbing sad stuff maybe if i didn't have a 9 year old son who is a tender little guy this wouldn't have bothered me but i do and it did i like books about the south and this was solid on that count","736":"excellent book i'm anxious for another by this new author","737":"great coming of age story very good characterization","738":"excellent a page turner narrated by 80 year old adelaide lyle community matriarch sheriff clem barefield and 9 year old jess hall north carolina i supposed i need to visit this part of the world and see if the stereotypes are grounded crazy pastor carson chambliss comes to town and rocks the world of many in a false faith reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's 'to kill a mockingbird' by richmond times dispatch i concur i've heard it said before that those who don't learn from the past are bound to repeat it and i just don't know what to think about that the past can just weigh on you if you spend too much time remembering it clem barefield i knew that real loss isn't something you feel after watching a child once a week while his mama sings hymns in church it takes a lifetime to build equity in loss","739":"http anita womanwifemom blogspot co","740":"love this book love the rhythm and flow of the language highly recommend","741":"i really liked this book the subject matter was so interesting and wiley cash writes very vividly great first book for him","742":" christopher stump hall has never uttered a word in his young life but one day out with his brother his curiosity gets the best of him and he witnesses something that will end his life and destroy the tattered fabric of his family set in the mountains of western north carolina the story is told in three voices jess hall - christopher's younger brother adelaide lyle the town midwife and keeper of the children during sunday services and clem barefield the local sheriff and a man who has a cross to bear against the hall family wiley cash has done a fantastic job of creating these three distinct voices and a book that you just can't put down bravo wiley cash i can't wait until your next","743":"this would be a 3 if we could do 's i thought the story started out pretty strong but dwindled some towards the end overall still a good read this would be a 3 1\/2  if we could do  1\/2 's i thought the story started out pretty strong but dwindled some towards the end overall still a good read more","744":"growing up in a traditional household jess hall was taught to mind your own business snooping around to get the latest dirt that goes on in small towns rumors that are started because of your good ear and the pressure to keep quiet is harder than it seems jess is overprotective over his little mute brother christopher that goes by stump together the two share a unbreakable bond they eavesdrop of the latest things that is happening in their local church after finding out about what carson chambliss does at his church they try to tell their unreasonable mother but she is convinced that he is doing the lord's work despite the evidence that proves that his teaching is obscene and afflicts harm of his church members adelaide lyle the town's midwife knows all what there is to know about the church tempting to leave the church numerous of times after witnessing things that should not be seen in a church dancing and singing is not the only thing that goes on but convincing her local residents is another story carson's bruised hand tells more about his painful past than the present in addition clem barenfield a shield tries to stay away from the hectic things that goes on in his town but his life takes a turn fr the worst told by three characters this is a story of courage and redemption it is looking pass the bias opinion and seeing the truth that lies behind it all there are a few books that deeply move me this was not an exception i related to each and every character experience they went through and the triumphant victory in solely relying on your faith it is a memoir to what i went through in the church and it is a evocative novel that evoked every emotion that was humanely possible","745":"i don't have much to say about this novel except for i loved it in a strange way i'll compare it to the bell jar in that they're real life situations where society drives people to insanity i recommend this novel to anyone who loves a good yet sad story","746":"a worthy feat of writing and i read with great appreciation not a feel good book by any means but certainly a book of worth i liked the perceptions presented by three narrators an elderly woman a nine year old boy and the sherriff i found myself imagining what certain other characters might contribute if their private thoughts were known","747":"loved this book i devoured it in one sitting the characters reach out and grab you as you try to figure out what is going on in this small town in nc creepy pastor snakes family drama this book has it all plus top notch writing definitely will be on my faves list for 2012","748":"find it here for $ 20 00 https www facebook com pages words","749":"wonderful southern fiction looking forward to book 2","750":"wow it's hard to believe this is a first novel the writing is so confident i thought this novel was deeply engrossing well crafted and original in his ability to evoke a place and its people cash evokes chute's beans of egypt maine i hope he will give us many more books highly recommend","751":"the writing u0026amp setting in the north carolina mountains reminded me of ron rash's novels enjoyed it as a thought provoking tale of a family's tragic fate at the hands of a disturbing snake handling minister","752":"good easy read backwoods story laced with fanatical religious themes","753":"i had a hard timing rating this book overall i would give it 3 5 stars the first half sort of drug for me and i had a hard time getting into it which may be because i had a lot of distractions in my personal life but i really enjoyed the 2nd half of the book and would still recommend it to others","754":"wiley cash has done an amazing job on his first novel this book is beautifully written","755":"this was a good novel it was hard to put down once i got into the story this was the author's first novel it was good from start to finish the author is a great storyteller the setting was southern it an exciting story about a family with a mute son and how the church was going to heal him the church was a snake handing religion that still goes on today it's about family good and evil death and murder and religious faith in the appalachians a very good book","756":"set in small town north carolina jess and his mute brother christopher spy something that leads to christophers death a family drama of religeon and murder","757":"i wanted to like this book more than i did somehow the story rubbed me the wrong way and i don't know if that was due to the writing or the format of the book it's told by three different people the sheriff the elderly town midwife and by jess an 11 year old boy the antagonist is a snake handling corrupt preacher who the townspeople are either blindly led by or just plain scared of a series of unfortunate events leads to tragedy yet that is only the beginning of what's to come","758":"loved loved loved this book the ending was just a bit quick and left me wanting more from each character","759":"maybe 3 5 stars started out really good but then it got a little slow and depressing interesting story though","760":"the story was ok i really didn't like the way the author kept changing the speaker and the time period every couple of chapters maybe if i had time to read the book in one sitting it would have been easier but it always took a while to figure out who was speaking and when this was annoying to me","761":" before you even open this book block out several hours on your calendar cancel all your appointments and find a comfortable spot to relax and read once you start reading you will not want to stop until you've finished the book wiley cash's first novel is the best book i have read in a long time the richmond times dispatch wrote this reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's to kill a mockingbird yes it is that good the setting the characters all of the suspense and suffering reminded me of a joyce carol oates story cash uses a nine year old boy an old woman wise in the ways of healing and hurting and a long in the tooth sheriff to narrate the action old timey religion and all the secrets the members of a snake handling congregation keep sacred the curiosity of young boys and the violence too often present when the lines between good and evil become blurred are the backbone of this tale wiley cash hit a homer with this one i anxiously await his next book","762":"i highly recommend this book particularly to fans of southern literature and even more specifically to my western north carolina friends the story is set here and is incredibly well written i'm looking forward to his next release this dark road to mercy due out in january 2014","763":"i'm in awe of a new author who can have a best seller i'm in awe of a story that grabbed hold of me from the very beginning and didn't let me go it's been quite a while since a book has done this for me in wiley cash's thrilling book i found myself immersed in a land i never knew and people i've never met but they came to live vividly in his page turning book yes a little dark but personally i like books of this nature pat conroy is a favorite author of mine and mr cash is right up there with him for me i love the way he wrote it from three people's perspectives very well done just enough information on the people in this book without becoming boring and over telling i like this man's style and everything i've read about him i am a new wiley cash fan this book is the first book i've ever read on my new kindle though i would like to own it in paper as well it's the kind i know i will re read in the future has that to kill a mockingbird type of story telling and for those of you who know me that is my all time favorite i can't say enough about this story i'm sad to let it go today but it will remain with me for a very long time","764":" 3 5 stars a sad book that jumped around a bit too much for me told via the perspective of three narrators i was hooked until the author strayed away one too many times from the original story of 9 year old jess his mute brother christopher stump and their experiences with the evil pastor view spoiler who uses poisonous snakes and other heinous methods in the name of god resulting in the deaths of the innocent hide spoiler while adelaide's the elderly midwife and clem's the sheriff stories were interesting too much time was spent on them detracting from the main story overall however i thought the book was pretty good","765":"an absorbing debut thriller narrated from the perspective of three very different characters i loved this novel","766":"very well written very sad there is so much evil and craziness and sadness in the world","767":"while this is not a bad book it should not be favorably compared to faulkner worst efforts i received this as a gift based on my appreciation for faulkner and i have to say that it failed to live up to that from any angle pacing is too slow given the minimal grounding and development of characters and the concept of place so central to the title is missing yes it all occurs in one geography but that doesn't have particular meaning place matters when histories matter in an intertwined way and that kind of development in the book is shallow rather than be able to identify with characters that are very different from me i was left feeling like i was reading a book about people behaving oddly for reasons that were due to place without relevant history","768":"from the very first chapter i knew this was going to be a powerful and emotionally draining story the book set deep in appalachian north carolina in 1986 is narrated by three characters 81 year old adelaide lyle 9 year old jess hall and the 60 year old sheriff clem barefield the focus of all of their testimonies is the town's only pastor carson chambliss and his \"river road church of christ in signs following \" the particular signs this pastor has his congregation following come from the gospel of mark 16 17 18 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover pastor chambliss insists on a literal translation of this passage and challenges his congregants with the many snakes he brings in crates for every service the character of chambliss is based on actual faith healers generally of the pentecostal faith and primarily operating in appalachia who have also established \"signs\" churches and who may require snake handling or poison drinking as evidence of salvation this practice has led to abuse in real life as well as in fiction in 1992 for example such a pastor in alabama glenn summerford was convicted for forcing his no longer desired wife to keep her hand inside a rattlesnake cage until she was repeatedly bitten she actually survived but he got 99 years in a bizarre twist to the story the new york times reporter who was covering the story was swept away by the spiritual ecstasy of the religion he was investigating and converted and there's more in 1998 glenn summerford's cousin rev john wayne brown jr died while handling a four foot timber rattlesnake during a sermon his wife had died of a snake bite three years earlier thomas burton in serpent and the spirit glenn summerford's story tells the story of summerford and his ministry via a collection of first person narratives a land more kind than home is in many ways a fictional and more tightly focused version of this story wiley cash's choice of narrators adds dramatic depth by interweaving their stories with that of chambliss we learn of a marriage that has suffered from the birth of a disabled child the lifelong pain of dissension between fathers and sons the repercussions of forgiveness or its lack how a young child might interpret the very adult things going on around him and the way faith can be wielded as a weapon all of the narrators and the others in their lives have suffered pain in need of spiritual healing but chambliss is the only game in town and as sheriff barefield points out to chambliss you ain't christ nevertheless pastor chambliss commands a mighty power over the town's residents through his use and abuse of the church one can't help but conclude that some of the tragedy that results is not even the worst or meanest thing that could have happened as cash writes in the epigraph quoting tomas wolfe in you can't go home again something has spoken to me in the night...and told me i shall die i know not where saying ' death is to lose the earth you know for greater knowing to lose the life you have for greater life to leave the friends you loved for greater loving to find a land more kind than home... \"discussion cash's ability to imagine the thinking of the three such radically different individuals who serve as his narrators is impressive and his atmospheric evocation of appalachia even more so and although the book may have been inspired by real events cash adds powerful dramatic elements to enhance and deepen the story additionally this is one of the few instances i can think of in which a totally evil character with no nuance whatsoever seems so realistic i could hardly bear not seeking him out and doing away with him evaluation this striking novel is not easy to forget the writing is exceptional and the characters well drawn highly recommended","769":" a land more kind than home has borne some comparisons to harper lee's to kill a mockingbird but i believe it stands on its own merits wiley cash's debut novel shares a similar setting but where racial tension is the predominant issue in to kill a mockingbird faith genuine and false are the issues on which a land more kind than home is plotted cash uses three different characters to present the story jess hall adelaide lyle and sheriff clem barefield each character narrates a chapter or two at a time telling the story from their perspective jess is a child adelaide is a elderly lady who refuses to attend church meetings while the current pastor is in control my words not hers and she even goes so far as to have the children join her for her sunday school so they are not subjected to the wild teachings demonstrations and healings of the pastor clem barefield is the sheriff who is called upon when things at church go desperately wrong the three perspectives make a well rounded telling of this gothic novel a land more kind than home will create a great deal of discussion as a book club read and that is just what members love a book they can sink their teeth into as a debut novel wiley cash has written a winner and i look forward to future revelations from him see my full review at http shirley mybookshelf blogspot c","770":"what a lucky find at the library a great story of devotion with a lot of twists crazy country preacher and how it affected the community","771":"the richmond times dispatch says it best reads as if cormac mccarthy decided to rewrite harper lee's 'to kill a mockingbird' i'd also add a pinch of 'gilead' by marilynne robinson 'peace like a river' by leif enger and 'plainsong' by kent haruf that's about as high an honor as i can imagine","772":"cash writes about the mountains of western carolina knowingly and beautifully though i don't think this book is a mystery thriller in the way that the publishers have marketed it for instance you know who has been killed and who has done the killing at the very beginning of the tale so the mystery and thrill of reading this book lies in finding out why its central characters behave in complex ways to the brutal crimes committed at it's heart this is a book about a family torn apart by certain members of a corrupt church people who traditionally would consider themselves faithful and holy this is also a book about the nature of evil and there is no getting around the fact that the book's villain pastor chambliss is a full out single celled villain however the point of the book is to show how the book's other characters respond to chambliss in complex ways i especially liked the character of ben hall's father jimmy an outlaw man who returns home right in the middle of the ruckus of snake handling and adultery and murder jimmy hasn't always been a good man but he is the right man to deal with the crisis at hand and cash allows him to achieve a form of redemption overall the book's more sensational thriller elements the snake handling and the murder are not the elements that make this novel a good story rather it was the humane and nuanced way that cash reveals each character from the most innocent to the biggest sinner that kept me turning the pages","773":" at first i thought oh no more madison county and serpent handlers however i did get into the story and found it a well written fast book it does speak beyond madison county which is good since the author is from gaston county i understand resolution a bit weak maybe but i'll await cash's next offering i do suspect some members of the appalachian community are a little weary of snake handling congregations and preachers but their stories are probably just better material than say methodist stories in this novel it's a device for more significant themes","774":"awesome story couldn't stop thinking about the events long after i finished the book","775":"shows the evil that can go on behind the scenes interesting in a way","776":"http www wileycash com bio htm this is wiley cash's bio from his website this was an awesome read excellent writing and character developement full of local lore and customs in this semi rural w nc setting prominent themes are family and identity as they intersect with evangelical christianity cash was taught by the best ernest gaines who gives a cover review a must read","777":" 3 ish stars it took me a while to get into this novel and when it ended i wasn't quite sure of its purpose because we don't get to see the impact that the novel's events have on jess the nine year old boy who bears witness to the craziness of the local church and its pastor the author does a great job however of delving deep into the psyche of some of the characters all of whom are told in first person narration each of the adult characters has a back story which is carefully drawn out bit by bit this is one i'd recommend for discussion at a book club it would be worthwhile to discuss the whys whos and hows of this story","778":"recommended by a friend thanks heidi this was a great story with 3 narrators that all have great southern accents to fit their parts very well","779":" this debut novel from wiley cash is told by multiple first person accounts that weave together in unexpected ways in rural north carolina a church has been twisted into an ugly hidden place with newspapers to cover the windows blocking the outside world but when newspapers don't cover the sins of the church's pastor from young boys' spying eyes a healing touch goes astray and everyone is pushed to their breaking point the characters sprang to life as you are transported to north carolina while reading this book i thoroughly enjoyed this tale and look forward to reading more by cash","780":"very compelling once i started reading it i couldn't put it down secrets lies religion and family dynamic impact on one family is heart wrenching","781":" the mountains of north carolina have their own culture the families have lived in their own specific valley for years and everyone knows everyone else's business whose farm is doing well who is drinking a bit too much who is sleeping with whom it is a culture ripe to grow feuds an atmosphere where wrongs can be brooded about and allowed to fester for generations loyalty and betrayal are everyday affairs that echo across the years it is also a culture in which religion can play a large part this is the land of small rural churches where some of the more fundamentalist beliefs play out churches where snake handling or poison drinking to prove belief that god will protect the righteous is not unusual churches where charismatic preachers can hold huge influence over the families that attend their churches jess hall is a curious young boy living on a farm with his parents and his older brother christopher known as stump to everyone stump is a mute and jess is protective of him even though he is the younger the boys stumble into a secret that will have consequences that impact the entire community and make life change in ways they could never foresee a land more kind than home is wiley cash's debut novel he grew up in this area of north carolina and his portrayal of the area brings it to life the plotting is intricate and the pacing is excellent the characters are portrayed realistically this book is recommended for readers interested in family relationships","782":"really enjoyed because of the marshall nc setting it was a quick read and i could have done without the snakes","783":"a land more kind than home is not a read for the faint of heart truly great southern fiction has never been about cartoonish characters or moral dilemmas that are easily solved twain faulkner mccullers and o'connor pioneered a style of writing that dealt with sensitive and controversial human issues which when read by northerners seemed secluded to rednecks and white trash from south of the mason dixon and when read by southerners appear to be written by sacrilegious carpetbaggers this tradition was carried on in the second half of the twentieth century by mccarthy gay and conroy now in the early years of a new century that tradition has progressed under the watchful and articulate eye of wiley cash a land more kind than home is a tragedy about a boy killed during a religious ceremony growing up in the south as a baptist i've always been warned about those sign churches and their craziness cash sheds light on some of the cult like attitudes that populate their membership and the dangers of letting any man who thinks he is christ incarnate lead the story is told from the points of view of an eight year old boy who has lost his brother a mid seventies spinster midwife who must define her own true faith and sheriff who must come to grips with his own past in order to make sense of the tragedy i won't spoil the novel for anybody but suffice it to say that there will be those who read a land more kind than home and don't see the message and their will be those who read it and choose not to see the message is it preachy at times sure are there scenes that would have been better left as short stories of course that is true with all novels but for a first time publication dealing with such heavy subject matter it is hard to beat this wiley cash masterpiece","784":" this book was on my list for some time and when i saw that wiley cash has a new book coming out i moved this up to next on my list and am glad that i did one of my oldest friends lives not too far from where this story takes place and i've been there often enough to have spent time in an area where you see more churches than you can count my favorite is still the church of bob with a less than pure preacher behind the story some too curious for their own good children and a few no nonsense neighbors watching out over all in this small town cash's debut novel will surely grab you and pull you in","785":"very good story rich with southern stereotypes you have the evil evangelical the plucky independent old maid the ne'er do well father the damaged son and the good outsider sheriff it's a gripping story and is told well i enjoyed reading it i just hope every person who reads this portrayal of the south reads marilynne robinson's gilead as well","786":" my goodness but this book was fantastic his use of local color and dialect his descriptions his use of the weather to ratchet up the tension and all this from a first time author the town midwife adelaide who sees it as her job to protect the children the sheriff who has plenty of tragedy in his own life and the two young boys jess who is in third grade and his older but mute brother christopher when evil comes to their small appalachian town in the form of itinerant preacher chambliss events are set in motion that will leave few unscathed two boys would pay for their natural curiosity in a way that is out of all proportion to their misdeed i knew this story drew me in when i found myself wanting to grab one of the characters and tell them not to do it i felt the tension in the pit of my stomach like the way one feels before the big drop on a roller coaster yet in ends in a note of hope and a looking forward to that i would not have thought possible absolutely gripping","787":" i would have liked to give this book a 3 5 if that was possible good debut novel that i imagine really captures the southern rural flavor of backwoods north carolina culture especially the religious angle characters well written with the story told by 3 of the characters the boy jess the older lady adelaide and the sheriff clem i like the way the story unfolded with the alternate view of these three mid story the plot drug on a bit for my taste wanted to get on with it and find out what was happening only thing that prevented 4 stars for me this is a very sad story of religious obsession mis understandings evil of some men etc","788":"right after i finished this i read about a snake handling preacher who died of snakebite just like his daddy a snake handling preacher did that guy seemed a lot nicer than the snake handling preacher at the center of cash's excellent debut seriously this book is great","789":" something has spoken to me in the night and told me i shall die i know not where saying \"' death is to lose the earth you know for greater knowing to leave the friends you loved for greater loving to find a land more kind than home more large than earth \"this quote from thomas wolfe's you can't go home again provides the title for wiley cash's novel which takes place in a fictional rural area near wolfe's home in asheville in the western part of north carolina in the hills and mountains of the blue ridge from the beginning this novel feels like a greek tragedy narrated by three people the young jess who sees something he should not the old lady who is the conscience of the town of marshall and the sheriff who has to pick up the pieces when jess' mother makes a terrible mistake and his father does what he has to do a place more kind than home is cash's first novel beautifully written it is not a folksy local color tale it's an intensely suspenseful narrative about people who are unable to forget the past and struggle to cope with the surprises of the present","790":"i enjoyed this book it is written with great simplicity and embodies the elements of tragedy i could clearly envision this small community in north carolina the faith community of one of its churches and its cast of characters however it is the book's epigraph and final chapter that add power and grace to this story for the plot i would rate it a 3 because of the themes and moral of the story i would rate it a 4","791":" i got this book through a first reads giveaway i wanted to like this book more because the plot had great potential but i didn't like how the characters chosen to be used for their first person narratives didn't really help the main healing morale to the story my favorite character was clem but mainly because of the story of how he lost his son i couldn't really feel bad for the boy jess although he was clearly a main character because the people that were actually shaping the story his mother father brother and that pastor were all treated like minor characters i understand why the author might have not used those four important characters to use as first person narratives since the book shifts by different characters' points of view like every other chapter or so so it can be like a kind of show not tell method of storytelling but i would have actually preferred seeing the sides to ben and julie's stories the parents of jess and stump seeing ben and julie's perspectives would have probably made me appreciate the whole story more especially with what happens at the end of the novel everything felt anticlimactic and i had no sympathy for any of the characters except stump and clem and sort of the grandpa","792":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here while a tiny bit dubious during the first chapter this story held my attention while surprising me a number of times a satisfying albeit sad conclusion","793":"i finished this book in two days and could hardly put it down the story of religious zealously written in the first person by three main characters sucks you in","794":"there have been a bunch of alluring books lately and i was doing so well now that the push is to electronic works i was 17th of 48 holds at the library for several works and thought the books would be staggered alas the notice arrived that five were ready fortunately a land more kind than home is so compelling i could hardly put it down the prose is just spare and made me feel i knew these characters different narrators tell the tale set in marshall north carolina the first is midwife adelaide lyle who attended a church there but left when pastor carson chambliss arrives the congregation starts handling snakes as a means of faith addie takes the children to play outside to avoid the snakes she plays a major role in the past and present jess hall is nine and has been spanked by his mother for spying his finds in this book via unauthorized looking certainly move the plot along he has a brother christopher 13 also known as stump who is mute their parents ben and julie started becoming unraveled as a couple when christopher was born julie moved to the congregation of chambliss ben's father was a terrible drunk when ben was young he reappears as the plot thickens the third character we read about is clem barefield the local sheriff who has also had and seen his share of heartache i cared about these individuals and their fates jess is drawn into intense matters and i want to know how he turns out and yes i know these are fictional worries but cash's knowledge of the area and conflicts makes me care","795":"i listened to this on audio and the narrators were wonderful and that added to the story for me i highly recommend this on road trips","796":"loved this book","797":"compelling story i couldn't put this book down","798":"beautifully written but what happens to the characters are so sad the reason i didn't rate it higher is that i wished there was more to learn about the preacher and his church interesting conversation to be had about the power of religion and the willingness to believe","799":"i listened to the audible version of this book i thought the readers were outstanding and added greatly to the enjoyment of the book the author really painted a picture with words great writing the religious nature of the story appealed to me the characters were well developed except for the fact that there were so many deaths not a book for the depressed to read i really recommend this one no bad language in it either","800":"i did not like this book and would not recommend it to anyone","801":"wow elegant powerful accessible because great writing does not have to mean impenetrable pet peeve reminded me at times of to kill a mockingbird but with more grit multiple narrators again sucker for that technique when done well great story strong theme wow","802":"i really enjoyed this book by wiley cash it was very well written and the story was well timed and flowed very well i liked the different voices of the characters that were narrating the book the author did a great job with it","803":"had to give up on this perhaps if i american or had knowlegde of the setting but a chapter for each character just got too much","804":"a really intense look at appalachian way of life from some astonishingly different perspectives i was really drawn into this novel and had a hard time putting it down i found the tragedies the characters had to face incredibly sad but was astounded by their resilience what a great first novel i look forward to reading more by wiley cash","805":"read this for book club very good discussion would recommend","806":" this one had so much potential but it falls short in the ways first novels so often do a good editor would have been a blessing narratives find themselves interrupted by side stories that are colorful and interesting just out of place style falls into the repetitive subject verb direct object sentence structure for paragraphs on end narrators speak in i said i opened i drove i asked constructions that cry for even a little variety and beautifully original descriptions precede and are followed by the most cliched of expressions the characters aren't original but they're very well drawn and then they behave in the most non original fashion the climax is especially unsatisfying with a denoument that feels like a sled ride down a slope so slippery one has no time to see the entire trail the author aspires to thomas wolfe dom and has a long way to go but i'm glad he has begun that journey and i hope that a little more experience and a harder hearted editor will be his friends","807":"a lovely first novel i look forward to more from him","808":"this is a gorgeous novel evocative prose an elegant plot with richly developed characters and a beautiful symmetry in the end tragic hopeful great stuff i'll admit i am predisposed to love southern stories but no handicap needed here","809":" jess u0026amp his mute brother christopher who everyone calls stump live in the mountains of north carolina where folks are religious in a fervent manner inside a church that is full of secrets the boy's mother worships there is an old woman in the town who guards all the children by keeping them out of that church by holding sunday school outside one day stump is brought to the morning service and what happens then and later at the evening service changes lives forever cash writes with a true voice of the people in that part of the country couldn't put it down","810":"this is an easy read it was easy not because it was simple but rather because the author has a nice way of describing things that our familiar at least to a southerner i was particularly struck of how the author had the child jess at times be the most intuitive character from the mouths of babes","811":"i am so happy that i received this first novel through a giveaway what a moving story i am from the area of the setting and i can attest to the authenticity of the voice of the characters this is just the kind of story that coils itself through many old southern families the different points of view reminded me how i've always heard stories like these in my family you have to get everyone's side and backstory to get the whole picture while i was slightly disappointed in the ending i can honestly say i don't know what i would have wanted to happen what wiley cash gives us is probably the most realistic of conclusions yet i still wanted more i look forward to reading more by this clearly talented author","812":"a great book a true literary achievement this is one of the best novels i've read in a long time it is clearly a literary novel wiley's talent is everywhere but it almost reads like a thriller because you want to see what happens next you want to keep on turning the page how late it's getting and the fact that i have to go to work the next day never cross my mind the three characters who tell this story each have their own unique voice and all are great but it's jess who really shines this is a novel that should be read by everyone i met wiley at a reading in pittsboro and he is a great guy really seems like he enjoys talking to people i'm looking forward to his next novel and he's made a fan out of me picture cormac mccarthy with a little more hope that's wiley cash that's the only way i can think of to describe him","813":"wiley cash wrote a very suspenseful novel full of thought provoking events the characters were fully believable and the book was hard to put down can't wait to see what his next novel will bring","814":"4 1 2 a moving read","815":"great book loved it i highly recommend it","816":"oh how i love a good family story and its a southern story my favorite type the story is told by 3 distinct characters captured so perfectly and believable in this writer's first novel congratulations well done i am so happy i stumbled upon it i look forward to your next effort","817":"3 for this one","818":"this is a fantastiv","819":"having spent a couple of years in the mountains of north carolina i was drawn to this novel its focus on small town family religion and brainwashing makes it a gothic thriller people really need to rethink this idea that the country is loaded with innocence and cities perpetuate crime and sin not so but i don't want to generalize a good read","820":"this is now one of my all time favorite books skillfully written and artfully told i can't say enough about every aspect of this book and i am recommending to anyone who will listen just fantastic the only downside is that i can't go right out and read another wiley cash novel because this is his first i am so looking forward to the next","821":"when a book's setting takes place in a church where the windows are covered in newspaper - you know something bad has happened or about to happen a land more kind than home had me captivated from the beginning and didn't let go the entire 300 pages a young boy who is mute gets mixed up with a mother who was depressed a church which had lost its way and a shady preacher through the narration of several different characters this book highlights the fact that people have a tendency to get so confused and hurt each other in unimaginable ways even though i knew this story was fiction--i was still glued to the tragedy and found myself hoping for a positive outcome yet fearing that was impossible i was shocked sad happy and bittersweet all at the same time by the conclusion despite the emotional upheaval i am very glad i read the book i would love to discuss it in a book club sometime so many issues could be tackled i had the pleasure of meeting the author wiley cash last weekend so his voice was my narrator through the book which ended up being perfect if he hasn't recorded an audio version he really should","822":"really good story teller and great first novel","823":"it is written from multiple points of view and i ended up skimmingbecause two of the points of view were more compelling than the others","824":"i didn't hate this book but i was really underwhelmed by it the author seemed to be taking his time and created a really interesting set if characters and a combustible situation but the exciting parts were over too quickly and the character building dragged on for me it was ok","825":"loved the book reading in 3 sittings","826":"wiley cash has written an excellent debut novel of how curiosity in youth can go terribly wrong jess and his brother enjoy spying on people but it's always been in good fun but they're not prepared for dealing with the consequences of seeing something they were never meant to see","827":"a land more kind than home by wiley cash is a novel taking place in a small town in north carolina i saw a lot of great reviews and articles about this book and thought that i might enjoy the story as well jess hall is a young man who has a lust for life and adventure he is also protective of his older brother christopher who is a mute and has developmental problems one day christopher also known as stump sees something he's not supposed to and the consequences are enormous jess adelaide lyle the town's midwife and clem barefield the sheriff all narrate the story with their own unique perspective and painful history i had a tough time getting into a land more kind than home by wiley cash the first 80 pages or so seemed to drag and only when the sheriff was introduced did the story pick up even though the book is cataloged under the \"mystery\" genre the story is pretty much straightforward and there is no mystery per se from a technical aspect this is a superb book mr wiley is extremely talented and even though i might not have enjoyed the whole of the story i certainly enjoyed embracing the literary aspects of the narrative the real star of the book is the atmosphere which gives this timeless story a rich and expansive feeling the set of characters is fantastic each one of them probably deserves a book of their own i don't say this often actually this is the first time i ever said this but it would have benefited the book to have plus or minus 50 pages more of character development the story is slow and steady the drama builds up slowly but ends very quickly without giving any character it's just due however many things happen in the book a lot of innuendos and dark undertones which could give book clubs hours of fun discussing what was could have been or would have been in the story see the reading group guide it's too bad that the author chose to tell the story from the perspective of three characters that all share the same perspective it would have been interesting if another character who doesn't share their point of view has his or her say a land more kind than home is a smooth elegant and enjoyable novel the characters are vivid and interesting mr cash has fantastic talent which is sure to make him a rising star in the literary world and i am waiting to read more from his pen for more reviews and bookish posts please visit http www manoflabook com","828":"this book is like a country song beautifully written with a sincere and rhythmic southern accent tinged with sadness and tragedy from beginning to end i loved it all the way through and was sure i'd give it at least a 4 star rating but the final two chapters just didn't give the characters what i wanted them to leave with nor leave me with i suppose i wanted more redemption for some of them and while it's really not up to me to judge the author's decisions upon their fates i really wish he had made different choices but again like a country song it resonates","829":"this book left me wanting to throw it down and stomp on it i'd really like some other reactions what did you think of it","830":"as sad as expected i think i would like a novel just about adeline","831":" wiley cash is a talented writer with a gift for describing the natural environment he definitely establishes a concrete sense of place and is great at dialogue his description can be so thorough that it becomes a bit frustrating at times i don't need to know exactly how the sheriff closed his patrol car's door i want to find out what happens next this story started out a bit slow but built to an entrhalling and violent climax toward the second half it became hard to put down some of the characters are so frustrating you just want to shake them but they did feel painfully tragically human i really look forward to seeing what cash writes next","832":"good debut novel full of guns religion with snakes rednecks and cheating wives and preachers good read","833":"while appreciating a slight twist of literary technique in that chapters alternated in first person between about half a dozen characters and folded back into the main story line like shuffled cards the style was too formulaic for my taste the cruel twists of fate that doomed the main character were inexplicable and therefore left me feeling sadly flat lastly given that every chapter is written in first person there is no break in the mountain vernacular i finished the book only because it was a book club pick","834":"wonderful writing each character was so fully developed that i will miss them i will look forward to the next wiley cash novel","835":" the short of it while this story had me sitting on the edge of my seat wondering how it would all end it fell flat for me the rest of it it's garnered a lot of praise so i was a little surprised when i closed the book and felt less than impressed but in all honestly this book has everything that i normally enjoy in a book but perhaps it had to do with timing i had just finished a rather meaty book and the other book was still bouncing around in my head perhaps this contributed to my feelings over this book either way i'll try to give it a fair shake here jess and christopher live in the small town of marshall jess is the adventurous one and very protective of his mute older brother christopher christopher thought to be slower than the other boys is often called stump and when stump witnesses something he shouldn't the results are disastrous for all involved the story is told by multiple narrators jess adelaide lyle the town's midwife and clem barefield the sheriff as the midwife adelaide delivered many of the town's children and because of that she knows most of the kids and is familiar with their families at least enough to know how they tick when the town's pastor carson chambliss performs a snake charming ritual that goes wrong adelaide takes it upon herself to move the children to a separate sunday school in order to protect them from what is going on in the main church it's clear from her actions that although she doesn't approve of what chambliss is preaching she is trying to respect his beliefs and the beliefs of others but even with protection something goes terribly wrong and jess is left to deal with the heartache i think the main problem i had with this story is that i felt as if i was reading the story from a distance i never really felt as if i got to know any of the characters except perhaps adelaide she rang the most true to me out of the bunch and i enjoyed reading her parts of the story the other thing that i didn't care for that i rarely care for in any book is the strong religious aspect i am a believer but this book bordered on fanaticism and i just didn't care for it what i liked though and what i felt worked were the alternating chapters had my brain been free to really focus on this book i think i would have enjoyed it more as i did feel moments of intense emotion but in the end it never hit the \"love\" mark for me for more reviews visit my blog book chatter","836":"kept my attention and thought the author did a good job with voice the ending seemed rushed it didn't leave me feeling satisfied","837":"i stayed up until midnight finishing this book last night i just could not stop turning those pages it's hard for me to decide what to rate this book though sometimes i am not a fan of the stars rating because although it is well written and certainly kept me very interested i have mixed feelings about the ending and message faith religion over common sense is sometimes a hard pill for me to swallow and there were times throughout the book that i could not understand the motives of some of the characters or maybe i did understand the motives and was still baffled it is definitely a good read so i'll go with 3 5 stars goodreads needs to allow for half stars in my rating already","838":"i couldn't help but admire this forethought and prediction clem barefield sometimes i think that i might've let ben stay i just finished this book and i'm tearing up but i couldn't tell u that i know exactly why it's just one of those stories you know so beautiful and rich that it leaves you hollowed out and slightly drained in a good way by the end of it absorbing cash illuminates a familiar truth of southern lit many are the ways that fathers fail their sons entertainment weekly*i couldn't help but admire this forethought and prediction clem barefield sometimes i think that i might've let ben stay the night with us not because i was afraid of what his daddy would do to him if ben came home drunk just like his old man did every night but because i was afraid of what ben might finally do to his daddy with that license that alcohol can give a man i wasn't ever afraid of ben hall but i think i might've been a little afraid of what he was capable of doing to other people including his daddy it was the memory of that night especially the look of what i took to be fear or maybe anger in ben's face that put me ill at ease as a drove out to adelaide lyle's house the thought of ben confronting some of those folk with the knowledge that they might be in some way responsible for his son's death made me worry that all those years' worth of beating would come to a head in a violence that ben couldn't predict a violence he'd have no interest in controlling i bookmarked this page as soon as i read out of respect for the author's words through the character this novel has been compared to to kill a mockingbird i haven't read it but i can see now why it is placed next to a southern literary classic","839":"wiley cash is a friend from childhood even in our early teens i always knew he would end up doing something great his new book 'a land more kind than home' is amazing and a pleasure to read the book is so well written that it's easy to visualize the story in your head i highly recommend this book enjoy","840":" a solid 4 star i enjoy stories told from different people about the same event and the consistency and interaction of said events is beautifully portrayed stephen king has many stories with that approach and i can now add wiley cash to that writing style this tragic tale is told from a boy an 80 something year old woman and an aging sheriff their views often cross the same time period and include each other in their observations this seems to add authenticity for me to the story a real treat and totally engrossing tale","841":"kept you wanting to read until you were finished","842":"maybe the best book i've read this year recommended to everyone","843":"i truly hope this author writes many many books in the future this novel was written from three different perspectives an elderly sunday school teacher a sheriff and a nine year old boy heartbreakingly sad in parts and a predictable ending i still give the book 4 stars definitely worth reading","844":"i enjoyed the book a picture of southern life in the hollers snake handling preachers a faithful elderly lady an wife and husband with two boys one of whom is a mute and the sheriff who gets involved there were a couple of times when we got background on both the elderly lady and the sheriff which seemed to be a bit much and took away from the movement of the plot and what i think is a great challenge to any author namely the conclusion of the book in this case seemed a bit abrupt with a little metaphorical lesson tacked on the end the book is written in the words of three narrators a nine year old boy the elderly lady and the sheriff i listened to the audio book and the use of three separate narrators came across as very natural and did not interfere with the telling of the story i understand this to be wiley cash's first book i'll read the next one when it comes out he's a good writer and has a good grasp of his characters and their actions a final thought comes to mind what was the title all about just where is the land more kind than home i'm not sure","845":"wow great book","846":"pretty good especially for a first novel i liked how the story was told from three perspectives that was an effective way to provide context and back story but there were heart breaking events in the story yet my heart didn't break or even ache so either i've turned cold or the writing could improve to draw more on emotions","847":"this is very good book and quite impressive since it is the author's debut well written a grim story of a broken family and the dark side of religious obsession","848":"a good book but once again a sad story it seems like i am reading a lot of sad ones lately i actually finished it on sept 21st seem like this book took longer than most but it was easy reading and i would really rate it between 3 u0026amp 4 stars","849":"easy to read wordwise hard with the story starting with snakes","850":"this book was too slow there were several chapters that i feel like could've totally been left out because they really played no part of the plot the plot and theme were good though i like how it was written from the point of view of three different characters with three totally different backgrounds","851":"loved this novel about two of my favorite topics western nc mountains and religion","852":"the book cover description of cormic mccarthy meets to kill a mockingbird is spot on brilliant debut novel from cash","853":"fabulous great characters though i am not from that area of the country i believe he got the dialect and speech correct plot unrolls easily and each chapter brings new insight using the perspective of three very different characters was inspired and i felt as if i was listening to each one tell their part of the story how the author came to be an elderly woman a middle aged man and a young boy of 9 when he wrote is the art of a great writer","854":"this story of two brothers in a small rural town was an excellent read","855":"i'm not sure what attracts me to these rural coming of age stories but they are attractive while i've read quite a few books recently that use multiple voices this books uses them in a manner that contributes to the gradual unfolding of a mystery not all at once mind you but bit by bit entrapping in a web that pulls you along until you can't stop turning the pages to find out who finds out what next","856":"this was okay but it didn't really click with me like i wanted it too also poor jess","857":"when i think of literature this style of book falls in my definition an experience on paper the characters were alive and the style of writing from various perspectives wove the whole world and story together tightly i was rather impressed and recommend this book wholeheartedly","858":"this book struck a chord in me since it revolves around what happens to a little boy who can't talk i felt like this book had the potential to be amazing but didn't quite live up to it","859":"this is the author's first novel and he did a bang up job on it the main character is a 9 year old boy who lives with his unexplainably mute 11 year old brother and his fractious parents the story is so easy to read and so easy to get engrossed in and then wham a shocker or two are thrown into the mix the point driven home to me yet again is that all kids do not have a fair shot at life and then sometimes if they are lucky an unsuspected person steps in to save them","860":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here the writing is excellent and the plot drew me in i finished this book in two days because it was so hard to put down the characters are amazing this man remembers what it was like to be a kid i do have a couple of issues with the story at one point adelaide lyle puts herself in danger by joining the antagonist at the church when she should have known better i did not completely believe she would have gone there alone or stayed when she saw he had the snake cage with him also there is a p the writing is excellent and the plot drew me in i finished this book in two days because it was so hard to put down the characters are amazing this man remembers what it was like to be a kid i do have a couple of issues with the story at one point adelaide lyle puts herself in danger by joining the antagonist at the church when she should have known better i did not completely believe she would have gone there alone or stayed when she saw he had the snake cage with him also there is a parallel with the death of two young men killed one accidentally by the other's father i won't say the parellelism is strained because that is too strong a word but it doesn't set quite right with me more","861":"is there any innocence left in the world not much in the wilds of madison county n c where a snake handling preacher metes out his form of justice and precious lives are lost this is a hair raising book of actions and consequences told in three different voices the conclusion plays like an apocalypse with plenty of loss and redemption great first novel","862":"i didn't really enjoy this book that much it just felt slow and the author has too many voices going which makes harder to concentrate on what is going","863":"very well written a little slow for me 3 5 stars","864":"interesting read not quite the ending i was expecting but makes sense in it's own way","865":"beautifully written i will watch for future books by this author the story is told through the eyes of three characters an elderly woman the sheriff and a nine year old boy cash's descriptions of the sights and sounds carried me right into the setting of the book","866":"disappointing wish i knew what people see in it","867":"it was a great writing even thou i was torn and wanted to put the book down couple of times during first couple of chapters i was not too happy about the portrayal of the church and faith however keeping in mind that it is fiction and things of that sort happen in the world i have persevered it was a sad book to say the least however very well written","868":"i would give this book 4 5 stars","869":"interesting story and well told","870":"4 and 1 2 stars this book took me by surprise as to how much i enjoyed it it was a powerful absorbing story told by three characters this device greatly enhanced the story telling","871":"well written but to much rambling in parts that made the book longer then need be","872":"3 5 nothing especially new in the story but the alternating narrative voices add an interesting perspective","873":"i love characters that bring out a strong negative reaction i know it's a good book when i find myself hating a fictional character think crooked letter crooked letter meets poisonwood bible an excellent debut novel that i flew through in a day","874":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i really liked the book it is about a boy whose brother is killed in a healing ceremony at his mother's church told from three different perspectives the author did a wonderful job of flashbacks to tie together several characters' stories an easy read","875":"a friend loved this book u0026amp gave it to me to read can't figure out why she loved it so much sad story","876":"an impressive debut that brilliantly captures rural western nc wiley cash is an author to keep an eye on proud to say i knew him when though i promise i am not biased in my review the tremendous reviews by so many others say it all","877":"i rank it 3 5 stars given that the overall rank is currently 3 88 i'm going with 3 stars i look forward to future novels from this author","878":" i wish i could give this powerful novel more than 5 stars a tragedy results from the actions of a truly evil \"snake handling minister \" and a woman who has misplaced faith in him the build up to the tragedy and its \"ripple effects \" are told from the viewpoints of three vivid characters who are involved in different ways i read this book via audio which enriched my experience since all three readers were perfect for the characters they narrated i think it's quite impressive that this excellent work is wiley's cash's debut novel i look forward to his future novels","879":" laurie read my review after you read the book lol this book fell short for me i kept thinking i was getting set up for a big show down or twist or some sort of big bang sort of moment however this didn't really happen for me the ending was much of a surprise and as sad as it was i felt it to be anticlimactic it really had the makings to delve deeper especially into the pastor's character his sinister being could have really been played up more to create an even creepier situation i also felt there were some small tangents in the story that really had no bearing on the plotline they were quite descriptive and well written but i was left wondering what the point was to some of it i just wish it was ratcheted up a couple of notches others will enjoy the subtle angst of the story so i can see the appeal to many people especially if you enjoy southern lit","880":"i have really been struggling with book endings lately i'm sure it has something to do with something in my life but i have no interest in figuring that out that said i enjoyed this book until the end no spoilers here but the end brought it down a star for me i thought the character development of the main character a boy named jess is great and the other characters including a preacher who enjoys using snakes in his sermons are also great the story kept me interested too","881":"i finished this book in one day from page one of this extraordinary debut novel i was hooked a fantastic work of southern fiction can't wait to see what wiley cash does next a great book for book clubs as the story and the characters will undoubtedly give much to discussion and debate","882":" i read this book slowly because it was quietly troubling in an ominous way not quite suspenseful more so that there was so much ugliness simmering in the characters' situation that you knew would push to the surface at some point the three narrators with limited perspectives increase that sense of powerlessness as a reader the writing is good and the story powerful i only wish we had gotten to know julie the boys' mother a little better i would have liked to feel some sympathy for her rather than frustration or at least see into her past for some explanation of where and why her mind went twisted","883":"a very southern book the geography and characters the book is made up of chapters weitten by each of the main players a different way to tell a story i liked it i still don't totally understand the title will see what others have to say","884":"this book reads a lot like a ron rash to me the characters are strong and the western nc location add interest","885":"this book is very well written the characters are well developed i'm not sure julie would have acted the way she did but all in all it was a good read 3 and 1 2 stars from me i will definitely read his next book","886":"this story wiggled right into my very bones and i am happier for it makes me miss larry brown just a little less i will snatch his next book up in a flash","887":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here great story told through a number of voices jess has mute brother named stump his

returned and now he is left to care for jess as his mother is no good for anything anymore this is a rather simplistic retelling of the story was quite good and i finished it quickly more","888":"a must read","889":"loved this book and read it in a weekend when i should have been writing lesson plans the characters are complicated and the prose evocative simple elegant compelling writing","890":"never underestimate the things people will do in the name of religion interesting book liked the different narrators","891":"i like southern lit even took a class on it in college picked this one up when i saw the nytimes bestseller and reads like to kill a mockingbird rewritten harper lee's book is my favorite but i gave this one a try a good example of storytelling didn't think i would like the changes in perspective in the book told as three diff main characters but ended up liking that too","892":"fabulous book set in the mountains of western north carolina three characters weave a tale of history love loss and betrayal this is a wonderful book and a very pleasant read the writing is so smooth that it is hard to believe this is wiley cash's first published novel he writes as a well experienced wordsmith of old read this book and keep an eye on the rising star of wiley cash","893":"sad but beautifully written i expected to see north carolina dust on my shoes when i finished reading the authors notes shed light on how he came to write this novel it does not surprise me he spent time in southern louisiana one of the professional reviews said this book was a little harper lee and a lot cormac mccarthy so true","894":"everything about this book was dull except for the title the characters the prose the plot it all felt so familiar and not in the way that excites","895":" this book initially caught my attention because some of its pre publication press likened cash's debut and writing style to one of my favorite authors john hart unfortunately i cannot really agree with this comparison first of all i would not classify this as a mystery literary or otherwise the plot did not hold any surprising twists or turns and was quite straightforward it was an interesting story with the setting seeming almost timeless in its rich description the book's strength really lies with this strong setting and atmosphere while the characters were not fully developed each narrator definitely had their own unique voice which is a difficult thing to master these strong narrators would lend way to a very nice audio version i would imagine and though the book did not live up to my expectations it is still an entertaining story with more of a focus on setting and atmosphere than plot","896":"i debated with myself whether to give 3 or 4 stars at times the story was so harsh i didn't want to keep reading in the end i decided it was worth the four stars there are plenty of things to keep picking at which i really like in a book it had both rich and tender moments in spite of the tragedy","897":" so sad to know this book could easily be a true story in an isolated mountain town a poor family is taken advantage of by a radical fake pastor the oldest boy is mute and slow and the mother will do anything to help him including casting out his demons in the church she is one of those ignorant church members who do not question pastor even when an elderly member died from handling snakes the story and characters are so real you find yourself a part of the community i hope this author is only beginning to write more books like this i'll read every one","898":"wow this book was amazing","899":" thank you elizabeth for recommending this book it was soooo good i love southern lit and this story was beautifully written wiley cash told his story using different points of view from a third grade boy to an older sheriff to an even older lady there is dark tragedy lurking in the hills of this sleepy north carolina farming community and with the help of a devious preacher who uses snakes to save sinners the story unfolds with a few poignant flashbacks the character of the young boy jess was dear to my heart this is a first novel and i look forward to mr cash's next one","900":"i liked the book esp the writing but i feel like i missed something important that would have made this a great book","901":"excellent debut novel a small southern mountain community torn apart by religious fervor a nine year old boy with nothing left to lose the story was not always easy to read but it resonated with meaning","902":" with narration by an old person a kid and the law set in the south in the 80's i kind of hoped that this book was going to be like an extended drive by truckers song meets a t c boyle book unfortunately the story never really got its hooks into me like i was expecting i thought the beginning played out a little slowly and i didn't start to get engaged with the story until about 100 pages in unlike some other reviewers i was not at all put off by the language of the book or any of the dialects in fact that combined with the setting was probably the most interesting part of the whole book i was fortunate enough to receive a free copy of this book via first reads","903":"a bit reminiscent of faulkner or crooked letter crooked letter this grim southern tale of tragedy in a north carolina town as told from several of the characters' perspectives was really well written and thought provoking this story of an autistic boy's death in the hands of a faith healer will stay with you a long time","904":"the themes of revenge faith betrayal goodness and evil forgiveness and understanding make up this book within the realm of a church in the mountains of north carolina that follows the bible literally the involvement of snake handling effects the characters and their lives this is a haunting tale of courage in the face of cruelty and the power of love to overcome the darkness that lives in us all","905":"this book really felt like the south to me exuding a sense of southern desperation and resilience with every page the multiple perspectives created a rich and well fleshed out story it was like several threads woven together expertly to form one cohesive tale of family tragedy and life in a small town i highly recommend this piece of southern literature","906":"cash tells this well crafted dark tale through the eyes of an old woman the sheriff and a 9 year old boy reminiscent of ron rash but perhaps better this first novel by wnc native may be the beginning of a long and successful career","907":"great coming of age book ending seemed rushed but overall i really enjoyed this one","908":"i wanted to like this book it was highly recommended i just didn't like it","909":"easy to read","910":"this was a well written book that kept my attention wish the ending was a bit different i would read more by this author","911":"what a compelling read this was excellent dark southern gothic fiction at it's best it's suspenseful endearing u0026amp heartbreaking all at once superbly written w strong narrators","912":"wow i read a recommendation for this last week on a message board thread and was warned that this was a hard book to put down and they were right such a great story filled with good twists and grit i really enjoyed this one","913":"this first novel is incredibly powerful the story is told from the point of view of an innocent nine year old boy and two adults the contrast of life experiences pulls the story together a shocking story filled with so much sadness","914":"this book took a few chapters to draw me in but once it had me i was glued broke my heart but still a great read","915":" warning this opinion is filled with strong comparisons that will illicit shock horror incredulity at my own facile observations and call into question my ability to sanely review a work of literature the author portrays this small rural western n c town with such vivid imagerery like steinbeck did for his beloved salinas county the prose as beautiful as steinbeck's is terse full of eloquence wonder majesty good evil and mystery in both the setting and the people that populate it yet for all the comparison's he is still has his own unique style that if the author continues in such a vein of writing will quickly carve out a name and niche beholden to few with such talent and resonate with literary mastery that will be attributed to him and leave other's someday comparing their work to his the americana imbued in his character's reminds me of how steinbeck fleshed out the joads' in grapes of wrath and his sweeping epic east of eden yet he is not steinbeck nor will there be any to epitomize summarily steinbeck's unique and magnificent style nor is cash a cheap immatator this novel is one with a greatness that stands alone a terrific first novel that truly awed me i have never compared anyone to steinbeck and it is just a comparison like no two snowflakes are alike depite their molecular make up they still are examples of nature's beauty and possess their own image or in this case style of prose many of those reading this may deem it full of hyperbole and me out of my head to even use steinbeck in the same breath as a raw newcomer of an author but let me make crystal clear there is no other john steinbeck he is my embodiment of what a great author is and is my favorite author i merely make the humble comparisons and make use of steinbeck's themes as a benchmark to equate this novel's review if i am to be inquisitioned for literary heresy let me be the first to light the match and self immolate with my words metaphorically let's not get carried away people","916":"when jess' mute brother stump spies on someone and sees something he shouldn't have the world changes for both brothers gripping story set in a small town in the mountains of north carolina that revolves around a dysfunctional family an old mid wife and a fringe religion that uses odd tactics like snake handling to prove their faith","917":" received as an arc from the publisher finished this one in just a few days incidentally it put me at my challenge goal 50 books this year this book took me to a place and culture i didn't know the backwoods of north carolina in the 1970's a lifestyle that hadn't changed much in probably a hundred years the land of living in hollers moonshine herb medicine hound dogs superstition and snake handlers in church but i liked these characters except for one and i certainly hope mr cash has more stories in him i'd like to know what happened next","918":"i loved everything about this book all the flawed characters the great story telling the seamless writing an amazing debut novel","919":"i'm amazed that this is a first novel cash has written a very moving story of a people and place so different from our own the culture loves and fears and church that both hold them together and sometimes come close to destroying them","920":"i enjoyed this book i enjoyed the characters and the storyline my heart ached for almost everyone you could see the storyline evolving and could see the horror coming but i had to keep reading always hoping for the rainbow after the rain","921":"i didn't have any idea where this story was going the ending commentary by adelaide just hit home with me in thinking about people and church congregations it was a quick read and tragically entertaining","922":"the world is full of storytellers but few story weavers thank you wiley cash for this tapestry","923":" wiley cash has a real gift its hard to believe this is his first book it reads more like a seasoned author with many books under his belt i like that he gave the story three voices adelaide lyle 80yrs old loved her church until the snake loving carson chambliss became the pastor jess hall 9yrs old little brother to christopher stump hall who was an unwilling victim of pastor chambliss clem barefield 60yrs old sheriff knows that pastor chambliss hides behind a persona made up of lies if this book is a small glimpse inside the mind of wiley cash i expect his future books will cause his name to become widely well known i got this book free through goodreads first reads","924":"i absolutely loved this book but i love southern fiction set in the appalachians it is a quick read with easy to love characters","925":"two small nc boys with a penchant for peeking have their lives changed by what they witness through the window of a southern fundamentalist church wonderful storytelling with fully formed characters from the preacher to the parents to the old lady who knows better","926":"a sad twisted coming of age story about a boy living in rural north carolina whose mother is part of a snake handling church when his brother a mute witnesses an adulterous act the church acts back","927":"sorry amy i read this on the plane to charlotte and back writing on a tiny google nexus was daunting so i went with 3 stars i liked the talk of burley tobacco and such and these people were definitely familiar it continues to amaze me how different eastern is from western nc and not just the bbq there were some lagging sagging parts but overall i did enjoy it","928":"nothing fancy just a great story","929":"the way the characters spoke seemed authentic","930":"started out really good but fizzled out at the end","931":"beautifully written however there is sometimes the feeling that there are a couple of shorter works here that were stitched together some of the paths taken sem to be extraneous to the story nevertheless this is well worth the time you will spend reading it","932":"great book this is wiley cash's first novel and i hope there are more to come","933":"i loved this book told in three separate voices i could picture all the characters and was hooked from page one i also think it would make a great movie","934":"wowwwww i read this book on vacation and simply could not put it down fast moving engrossing beautifully written heartfelt and heart racingly thrilling told from 3 perspectives about an event that changes lives and a whole town i defy you to start this and not agree with every word i've said be prepared to piss off your spouse for the nose in the book vacation argument","935":"i enjoyed the book it was somewhat different it had snakes in it and i hate snakes so it creeped me out a bit the story was a good one i was impressed that this was the first novel written by the author","936":"one of the best books i've read in i don't know how long","937":"this was a terrific one to listen to it is told from the perspective of three different characters the audio version uses a different voice for each perspective and all the narrators are excellent","938":"a five star book in my mind is one that once started you read hungrily not being angle to put down this book is one that captivates you and nothing gets done until it is finished gripping haunting amazing story telling bravo","939":"wow this would make a good movie the scene is set in the mountains of western north carolina and involves family dysfunction a young son's disability religion faith and healing the author pulls the reader into the story with his understanding and grasp of a small mountain community indigenous to this area exceptionally well written","940":"i hate snakes even in text form they give me the heebie jeebies","941":"our wilkes county to read book with author coming to library discussion in october","942":"best book i've read in a long time","943":"i loved this book excited about another good new nc author","944":"i'm a biased reader as i love southern fiction i love family drama and delving deep into characters' hearts i prefer stories narrated by those within and mr cash spins a yarn with flawed and beautiful thread so thankful to have come across this book on the library shelf otherwise i may have missed it","945":"i liked this book it reminded me of crooked letter crooked letter interesting characters and the power of loss and forgiveness","946":"i found the writing in this book nice and the story engaging i read it quickly i liked the 3 points of view but wished they had included one from a believer like jess's mom i would be interested in people who buy into this type of religion i also thought it made the ending very tidy with the preacher just being a bad guy would have been far deeper if he really believed he was a man of god","947":"great read very well written even with the story rotating through 3 different narrations","948":"this felt hurky jerky at the start lurching the present day crime forward in a chronological tangle but before the halfway mark it had smoothed out its storytelling stride the flashbacks becoming interludes that felt like sitting on the porch of the general store to listen to the oldtimers tell of old scandals and how people used to be before life ran over them the end was abrupt and maybe too neat i don't know that this will be one that will stick with me but i did enjoy reading it","949":"we in the south excel at turning secrets into powder kegs and wiley cash is just as good at recounting the inevitable detonations he does so in his debut novel by building an authentic appalachian community where isolation breeds intimacy where characters exhume a long and often tragic shared history in search of the keys to understanding their present lives","950":"a pretty good story i enjoyed reading it","951":"so good i finished it in two nights it's certainly not a feel good novel but one that is well written and more enthralling each page certainly shows you how people can get caught up in persuasive speakers preachers i hope this first novel by this author is not an only novel","952":"beautifully written book really enjoyed it","953":"beautifully written book debut of this writer a real recommendation from my part yes the book is a slow read not really pacy story but that did not bother me at all all the more does the beauty of the story the atmosphere and the writing come through i loved the change of narrator and story line per chapter and you really feel the tension and atmosphere drifting from the pages a land more kind than home tells the story of the bond between two young brothers and the evil they face in a small north carolina town the novel is narrated by three characters nine year old jess the youngest of the two boys and the lone witness to the tragedy that befalls his autistic brother stump under an adult's hand adelaide lyle the church matriarch and moral conscience whose suspicion of a preacher drives her from the congregation and clem barefield a local sheriff with his own tragic past who struggles to untangle the roots of the tragedy in a community that has been intimidated into silence they said he could perform miracles heal the sick like my brother stump after it happened they said that sometimes miracles go wrong they say it was god's will and that's all there is to it but i know what i saw and it wasn't a miracle i hope this author publishes a new book soon","954":"there were times when reading during which i thought maybe i could love this book but on the whole it left something to be desired general lack of character development and a glossing over of some of what i would have expected to be major focal points of the novel sure it would have been twice as long but it would have done the story more justice","955":" in his debut novel author wiley cash tells a chilling tragic tale from the view points of three of the main characters the first is from adelaide lyle an town's elderly midwife and healer who finds that the things that have been taking place at their local church isn't something that the children should be a part of when she confronts the pastor carson chambliss he relents to having the children spend time with her but only if she is willing to keep the secrets of the church to herself seeing herself as the children's only protector she agrees the second part of the story continues with a young boy named jess who has an older brother christopher that was born a mute earning the nickname stump which the reader will learn about later in the book the spend their lazy summer days hunting down salamanders and just being boys in madison county everything was going along perfect until jess and christopher spied on his mother one day and after that nothing would ever be the same again the final part of the book picks up with the local town sheriff clem barefield who has a bitter and painful past of his own being a sheriff and resident in the small rural town of marshall the reader will learn how this man is interconnected with the case of a lifetime when he's called into investigate a murder what happens then will completely change everyone's lives forever i received a land more kind than home compliments of william morrow a division of harper collins publishers for my honest review this was an interesting story with a unique twist i can't give away but once you begin reading the story hooks you until the very final page in all honesty i didn't see how this plot would turn out in the end and think that wiley cash did a masterful job at creating a book that readers will enjoy for his debut i rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars and for those that love a bit of suspense with their murder mystery in a town that doesn't want to share their secrets then this is a must read for you","956":"i always love a book when its chapters are told by the different characters' points of view i think the author did a great job with the voices in the story and how the story unfolded this book kept me interested from the beginning and i did not expect the ending for that matter there were plenty of things i didn't expect good book","957":"a bit over descriptive which tended to draw out the story but overall a good book","958":"impressive and thoroughly engaging","959":"great book beautifully written","960":"religious fanacticism rattling snakes southern mountain landscape curiousity form the outline of the novel this is a wonderful debut from wiley cash about 2 brother raised never to spy one who doesn't speak and one who speaks out and changes their lives forever told from the perspective of 3 un related characters really pieced together the story in an entirely new and fresh way i loved all 3 narrators and the voices and perspectives they offered adelaide lyle an elderly christian who trys to save the children from the grasp of cult leader snake wrangler pastor chabliss sheriff clem barefield an officer in a small town who has demons from the past that tie in with the hall family and then we have little jess hall the younger of the 2 boys in the end i was angry with some of the character's decisions mostly julie hall jess's mother i can understand completely losing yourself in religion and falling blindly behind a leader but her actions for me really made me angry can't wait to see more from this up and coming author","961":"wow i really enjoyed this book some seriously intense business","962":" loved the writing loved the narrators loved the setting the language the intertwined lives and fates of the people in rural north carolina that make up the plot i hope wiley cash writes a lot more as it stands i'd be happy to read anything he publishes i'm afraid to talk much about the book as i don't want to give away the plot or tell you too much that you should discover for yourself suffice it to say that this unlike far too many books is a wonderful debut novel that reads like one by a seasoned writer give this one a try","963":"can you believe it we've hit stop #11 on our summer passport tour the united states of america this is an amazing story about two brothers who were enjoying their childhoods until one day they saw something that they shouldn't have seen this one event set into motion a slew of events that would forever change the boys and their small north carolina town learn more about summer passport by checking out our tumblr page http summerpassport tumblr com #","964":"i absolutely inhaled this book one of my favorites this year","965":" i enjoyed this book especially reading the different points of view of the various characters sometimes though i found it a bit tricky trying to rememeber the chronology of events because there was a lot of backstory that made it difficult to transition from past to present i think i liked the character of nine year old jess the best i really felt a sadness for him and as a mom i wanted to comfort him a lot of the time there was a lot of building up to a seemingly big ending lots of rolling thunder and pouring rain and while the ending was tragic and sad it wasn't as epic as i was anticipating howerver i did like the way the last character telling the story ended it ultimately this is a story of faith and redemption","966":" full review on my blog here http onenovelconcept blogspot com 2 synopsis told from the point of view of three different characters in the book we are told a story of a boy who witnesses a healing of his older brother in a strange church where later that same day the boy is found dead after attending a second church service christopher stump as he goes by in the book is a mute and has never uttered a word in his life his mother after hearing what she thinks is him saying mama during the first healing is convinced that this preacher can heal her son and takes him back for the second healing we hear some back story of this preacher and why he may not be a healer and may in fact be a murderer all the stories told eventually converge towards the end as we see how this tragedy came to be and how each of these characters are involved my review this is definitely a book club style book and a great read my only issue with this book was how it all came together in the end it just left me wanting more i loved reading this book and i read it in about three days but i feel like there were unanswered questions and an anticlimactic ending there was great conflict throughout the story and i was highly entertained but with a slightly different ending i may have rated this book a 7 or 8 i will definitely read this authors second book with the hopes of an improved ending my rating 6pages 336author website http www wileycash com","967":"some novels are meant to be savored others devoured in one sitting wiley cash's debut novel a land more kind than home falls firmly into the latter category it is almost impossible to put this book down until the final page is turned and its many secrets are revealed set in a small town in western hills of north carolina the novel is a gripping tale of religious fanaticism and true evil jess hall is a nine year old boy who is extremely protective of his older mute brother everyone calls stump in one day jess finds his entire world changed by two unseen events the return of his estranged grandfather hall and the mysterious church \"healing\" that is intended to correct stump's deficiency unfortunately jess is unable to protect stump from everything and is soon finds himself forced into a premature adulthood the novel is narrated by three distinct voices that of jess as well as adelaide lyle the elderly midwife and moral strength of the town and sheriff clem barefield nearing retirement and still reeling from a personal tragedy of his own cash deftly captures the three distinct voices of his characters and spools out a story that is truly unforgettable as a native of western north carolina cash brings alive the scenery as well as the feeling of being a member of a small rural community cash has hit the writer's trifecta with this novel he's created a compelling story told by rich fully developed characters as well as perfectly capturing the setting of rural north carolina do yourself a favor read this novel and share it with everyone you know","968":"have you ever wanted to hug a book once you'd finished reading it because it was just that good no just me again oh well that's how a land more kind than home made me feel full review to follow","969":" appalachia lite cash has a plain straight up writing style that has no need for embellishment or detail which can lead to some pretty bits like i knew that real loss isn't something you feel after watching a child once a week while his mama sings hymns it takes a lifetime to build equity in loss there ain't nothing before that sadly some of this stuff gets a tad soporific as well i stood up from the table u0026amp got me a glass from the cabinet u0026amp went to the refrigerator for the milk i sat my glass on the counter u0026amp poured the milk until my glass was full and then i put the milk back in the refrigerator and carried my glass to the table i confess that passages like the latter make this book drag a bit for me when the horrible denouement finally occurs i found that i wasn't too shocked by it just kind of relieved that it was all over","970":"very well written book with great characters good read for doig fans","971":"one of the best books i have ever read read it in a day and a half absolutely riveting","972":"3 5 stars very solid drama well thought out good pacing compelling writing cash's first novel and i look forward to more from him","973":" the debut novel for wiley cash is an unusual tale of family u0026amp a small town in north carolina the story follows the tale of stump u0026amp jess who are 2 brothers who grew up in an abusive family u0026amp one that is full of secrets the story is told from a variety of different standpoints u0026amp flashbacks which at times hinder the story for about the first two thirds as we the reader get the background on this family u0026amp the issues they face on a day to day basis the story isn't perfect by far but it keeps you interested enough to draw you in until a stunning climax that changes your entire perspective on this novel definitely a nice start to a book that's written by for me a somewhat local professor","974":"to be fair to the author my book preferences lean toward epic fantasy and mystery novels this book was more atmospheric with conflicted characters and no heroes the tension kept me reading because i sensed it was about to boil over but i was impatient with the pacing","975":"engaging book i liked how it was set up with 3 pov narrators was surprised by the ending will look for more from this author","976":"wiley cash sure knows how to write a land more kind than home sic is written in three voices nine year old jess brother child and grandchild of 3 tragic figures ~80 year old adelaide former midwife town elder and 60 year old clem the sheriff they speak convincingly evoking a west virginia village a twisted pastor of a credulous congregation his non communicative older brother the bitter sheriff the elderly woman who stands apart from the rattle snakes and poison mind set of the church she grew up in cash sets the scenes subtly the reader is right there walking through ferns on an autumn day climbing a steep hill in a blizzard meeting a reprobate grandfather for the first time the three narrators carry the story along nicely moving it forward while filling in the back story deftly this would make a great movie","977":" i found this book on an npr recommendations list and picked it up from the library and wow what a read definitely book club worthy i couldn't put it down so compelling so well written the dialog passes smoothly from character to character filling in some of the blanks of the circumstances that made them who they are but the riveting story never stops i'm sure i'll continue thinking about these characters for days to come which to mean is always a sign that i've been changed by a book i'm looking forward to seeing more work of this caliber from wiley cash","978":" a land more kind than home was the first book i read on my ipad frankly i wonder if that's why i had some trouble connecting with the characters i felt clumsy flipping back to the table of contents and trying to find out who a particular character was the book is told through the voice of a young boy and an elderly woman the sad tale mirrors life in the reality of men using religion to control manipulate and destroy lives ultimately courage can be found in the pages and the plot is worthy of reading","979":"this was a very engaging book especially for its strong character development i am looking forward to reading wiley's next book","980":"my enjoyment of this book was probably influenced by the narration since i listened to it the story is told from the first person perspective of four different characters and all four were wonderfully cast a great listen and a great story","981":"cash's first novel and a wonderful introduction straight out of the southern tradition of harper lee carson mccullers and john hart this novel tells the story of a young boy who learns of the battle of good and evil in the heart of man a little earlier than he would like the nyt says reads as if cormac mccarty decided to rewrite harper lee's to kill a mockingbird and i'd say that's pretty accurate i'll be looking forward to more from cash","982":" although it definitely doesn't live up to the reviews on the cover what does this book was a good quick read it was a thriller that presented a simple plot through the eyes of characters that were not the main ones which i liked the main actors are just observed and this kept me reading more because i wanted to know what they would do or say next and read into what it would reveal about them i think that the characters do seem cliche and black and white at times the plot doesn't have any real twists and turns there really wasn't a single moment where i was surprised i wish that i was given more insight on ben and julie hall and what led to their almost bipolar changes in mood after a certain point that made me want to put the book down i wouldn't want to hear their story just seem them transition from a to z a little bit over the course of the novel i think that would have made the ending much more satisfying overall i think this was a great first book with great intentions if you read this book like a classic interpreting and thinking about each little remark like some sort of philosophical insight you will be very happy with it you will definitely see the resemblance to steinbeck and a strong inspiration from shakespearean tragedy","983":"it was difficult to put this book down","984":"this book grabbed me from the beginning and didn't disapoint i especially like the quote about dying in the beginning looking forward to mr cash's next book","985":"more like 3 5 i liked it and it was a quick read but it didn't knock my socks off","986":" i found this book just okay it was very one note the author was great at building suspense but i felt that it didn't live up to the suspense you were waiting for after going to book club u0026amp discussing this book i downgraded it to 2 stars the author is a good writer stylistically but to me the plot is problematic if the primary narrator weren't a child this book could be only a few chapters long not very much happens i also think that the author describes every footfall in order to take up time since the story has so little action at first i liked it since it was very descriptive but then i realized that it was primarily taking up space ben suddenly becomes an alcoholic u0026amp is violent out of the blue the mother doesn't hold chambliss responsible for what happened at all also the two most interesting characters in the book were barely seen the sheriff u0026amp the grandfather and despite those characters being interesting u0026amp minuscule the end seemed to imply that their tiny story of forgiveness was the primary theme of the book the last few pages were very trite without the snakes this book would have been awful the best thing about this book was that it did lead to a very interesting book club discussion i found that people read a lot into the book based upon their experiences with religion","987":"jenny's february 2013 book club pick","988":"awesome debut novel i picked this up while traveling in asheville it was a staff pick at malaprop's the wonderful independent bookstore in downtown asheville mr cash nails the southern vernacular and tells a vibrant story from different perspectives including my favorite a young boy and his older developmentally delayed brother a great read i highly recommend it for book clubs there's a lot to discuss","989":" sometimes a book comes along that blends all the elements of a tradition of writing with its own unique flavor a wonderful smoothie a land more kind than home is that book in the southern tradition through three fully developed narrators with unique voices cash takes the reader on a journey through his own home through his own family all through a window of fictional panes i couldn't put the book down once i started and i'd read it again and again harper's to kill a mockingbird and carver's what we talk about when we talk about love are the only other books i can honestly say that about pretty good company this is my top pick of 2012 and the paperback to get in 2013","990":"6 23 13started this book on friday and read about three pagegs due to time limit today i had four hours available because i was waiting for my son at a baseball event and read to page 88 i couldn't stop reading and found myself hoping the event wouldn't end till i got to a certain place this book well written i love how it uses the time era and town dialect i like how i'm reading differnt characters perspectives finally got to finish loved the book i loved how it was written","991":"i always enjoy a good snake handling tale and this was a good book for some reason at the end though it left me a little cold i felt there were secrets alluded to that would culminate in a big payoff and i never felt like that really happened","992":"wiley cash creates a palpable atmosphere in this book so that you can almost smell the tobacco drying and hear the wind rustling through the corn fields his character development is also very skilful as he makes his characters realistic and lifelike so that you can really believe in them furthermore he writes from multiple points of view with different chapters being given to different people and i liked this as i felt i understood the motivations and feelings of the various people in the book although i felt that a chapter in ben hall's father's voice would have been a delightful addition however personally i found his writing style a little difficult to get into mainly because the different chapters are written in the first person as if they were the words of the person relating that particular chapter this in itself is not a problem but in order to replicate the accent and speaking patterns of the person accurately cash often wrote using poor grammar this is appropriate as it reflects the speech of the character but as someone who loves words and grammatical accuracy i found it somewhat irritating nevertheless i appreciate that it was included to give the story a greater sense of realism and believability the messages in this story are frightening they show how religious fervour can become dangerous and can lead to shocking events the book also covers a variety of other serious themes physical abuse poverty autism and child loss being just a few the ending is particularly powerful and shocking i certainly did not see it coming and it was though i had been hit in the stomach by a punch i didn't see coming wham and that was it the book ended leaving me shocked and stunned it's a powerful debut novel and it made me think recommended","993":"a good quick read learned about how snakes fire and poison were used to test religious faith nutty if you ask me","994":"i loved this book each character is deep complex flawed real it is so beautifully written quiet and powerful and the plot drives you forward i kept wanting to read this book rather than do other things which is a wonderful thing in a book and these days doesn't happen that often","995":"cash is an excellent descriptive writer really does a great job painting his caharcters to the reader","996":"it was a great book i could not put it down","997":"in my years of reading authors in the order of their writing i have come to realize that first novels are rarely great this is an exception while i confess to loving the works of conroy and faulkner even the late doug marlette this is an exceptional first outing read it you won't be sorry","998":"enjoyed reading it is written in the tradition of the great southern writers he tells a very good tale with from the prospective of 3 characters with the right amount of suspense built in book club book","999":"this book was wonderful wiley cash is an amazing storyteller i can't wait to read his next book","1000":"loved it i decided to read this book based on everyone else's reviews and i must say i wasn't let down one bit the beginning of the book definitely caught me off guard a bit since i wasn't expecting it to be a religious start i'm glad i didn't put it down though it's a very intriguing book and i loved how in depth it went with each character i recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read that'll keep you wanting more","1001":" argh accidentally ordered the large print version from the library it's huge small north carolina town religion with fire snakes and poison faith healing helpless and desperate mother begging for a miracle shyster preacher of course the story is told in three voices adelaide eighty one years old and the town's midwife clem the town's sheriff with a heartbreaking story of his own and jess a nine year old boy with a mute eleven year old brother adelaide is terrified of the church with its snakes and members speaking in tongues she's seen what can happen behind the closed doors and blacked out windows she's watched the men of the church keep its secrets while members sip poison and let fire brush their faces to prove that god will protect them that they have been chosen ten years ago she and pastor chambliss came to a dangerous truce that allowed her to pull the children from inside the church to teach them outside while their parents danced in feverish abandonment pastor chambliss has never trusted her for leaving and waits for her to make the tiniest mistake so he can turn the town against her and bring the children close to him again she also waits knowing that something horrible will eventually happen inside knowing she is powerless to stop it and hating herself because she's weak clem is also an outsider he has no interest in the church other than making sure the faithful keep to themselves and don't cause problems in town he's distrustful of the pastor but has no reason to poke around until stump dies jess has protected his brother for as long as he can remember stump has been forever silent and sometimes slips into a world of his own jess isn't sure if he understands what happens each day but is happy to sit beside him for hours watching dragonflies and searching for perfect rocks he loves his brother and knows that he'll always be there for him but stump saw something and chambliss has to make sure no one knows jess watches helplessly when stump is called inside the church god has spoken to pastor letting him know that he is ready to heal the boy the church will lay hands on him and he will be saved innocently and horrifically jess drives the nails into stump's casket using the three voices and jumping from past to present stories about the families are spread out while there are hints of what has happened to clem it takes a while for his story to be fully told and i liked that jess' own father and grandfather are part of the tale and while jess doesn't know this he's pulled into their history adelaide moves between wanting to protect the children to being desperate to save herself she's constantly watched by the church elders and she knows if she slips up anywhere she will quietly be silenced and no one will suspect a thing she is also angrily aware that she can protect the children by looking the other way and letting the pastor lead his adult flock the book is heartbreaking just when i thought things couldn't get worse they did the past keep crashing onto the characters blinding them to what was happening and filling them with rage jess watches it all in confusion and panic not knowing who is there to protect him and where lines are drawn the one thing i didn't like was jess' voice there were too many times when i thought \"yeah there is no way a nine year old would say that or notice that or reflect on something with that tone \" however i did like the innocent lens he brought i immediately knew what was going on and it was heartbreaking to see that he was unable to process it because of his age clem's story also works because he is an outsider to the church and yet can probably destroy it but is he working out of his dedication to serve and protect or does he want revenge for his own loss i really enjoyed this a lot especially because it showed the madness of pentecostal ceremony the scenes inside the church are both terrifying and fascinating watching the group whipped into madness it's easy to see how someone could desperately want to be part of it because it means god is there to protect them as an individual and it gives them a community that dictates every moment","1002":"this debut novel was pretty good in fact i would have given it four stars until the last few pages when a character's religious beliefs started to feel like authorial intrusion and i felt lectured to still well worth reading for the compelling story the fresh and often gorgeous prose","1003":"decent story but i didn't find it to be a real page turner i was also not overly impressed with the writing style four narrators tell the story each very different from one another yet there's really no change i'm narrative voice the little brother sounds the same as the old midwife it's a bit disconcerting it was a fine book but i wouldn't strongly recommend reading it definitely not very memorable","1004":"amazing book heard it compare to to kill a mockingbird and it is definitely up there stunning debut novel the characters and complex and diverse and the author paints and great picture of the town they live in","1005":"a quick read but a good southern story","1006":"wiley cash's a land more kind than home is a good read a first novel about family bonds small western north carolina town and evil insidious and riveting","1007":"loved this book a great debut team this up with salvation on sand mountain by dennis covington and little friend by donna tartt and you'll have a trifecta of great snake handlin' reads","1008":"wiley cash is a talented writer the language in this book is worthy of 5 stars the characters are complex and interesting the trouble i had with this book was due to all the accolades it has received my expectations were extremely high and completely not met this book is not a thriller as one cover review states it is not even remotely like to kill a mockingbird as more than one review declares it is southern fiction with the quirkiness that implies but southern fiction is hit or miss with me if you are a lover of language and well drawn characters you'll love this book if you love a page turning plot you might skip it i read it mostly because wiley cash is the only man i've ever met who looks fantastic in seersucker","1009":"this was a beautiful book although the entire time you're reading it you suspect it is going to end horribly while the technique can sometimes be distracting the author did a masterful job of alternating between the perspectives of multiple characters from an 11 year old boy to an elderly woman to the county sheriff i think this one will stick with me for a while","1010":"i loved the writing and ultimately i felt like the main character ended up in a better situation but overall this book is so sad","1011":"good storytelling thought provoking","1012":"the book was very well written i enjoyed the writing the problem was that 50 pages in i couldn't care about any of the characters it just wasn't my sort of story","1013":"3 5 stars when it comes to fiction i am a highly critical reader there is much about this book that deserves praise told in three voices the plot spirals slowly and carefully to a tight dramatic resolution that catches your breath and doesn't give it back the characters are well developed and the central narrative of the child jess is particularly well wrought cash has a gift of telling a story through the eyes of a child with his careful attention to the details of the present moment i felt the supporting narratives of clem and adelaide had less power and resonance and throughout the book cash's use of flashbacks were at times not as seamless as they could have been there were moments in the book when the voice of adelaide seemed to serve the plot i would have liked her voice to be a little stronger and moments too when i felt the writing needed a surge of adrenaline overall cash is a gifted writer and this novel does not disappoint by its close we are left as torn as the characters and hopeful in the solace they seek","1014":"nine year old jess hall is caught between two worlds those of childhood wonder and adult responsibility growing up in a small rural town in the foothills of western north carolina he and his older brother christopher play in the streams and woods getting up to the sort of mischief you'd expect of typical young country boys except christopher isn't typical he's autistic and his total lack of verbal communication has led to him being given the nickname stump despite jess being the younger brother he's fiercely protective of stump and feels it's his responsibility to make sure stump's path through life is as smooth as possible when things go horribly wrong during an attempted \"healing\" of stump by pastor carson chambiliss at the local evangelical church life changes irrevocably for both boys and nothing about their small town will ever be the same again the events of wiley cash's spectacular debut novel a land more kind than home are relayed through the perspectives of three different narrators jess being one of them weaving back and forth in time cash also adds the world-weary voices of longtime sheriff clem barefield and town church elder adelaide lyle to help flesh out his southern gothic tale of religion gone wrong and the destructive power of secrets the underlying themes of a land more kind than home - loss of innocence betrayal of trust manipulation of religion the search for forgiveness and redemption - are not new to literature how cash makes his mark and makes those themes his own is through his amazingly nuanced development of character and the story's wonderfully evocative mid 1980s rural western north carolina setting for an author to settle so comfortably into the skin of a character that he can bring them to life as real as any person you've actually known is a special talent... and cash does it times three jess sheriff clem barefield and adelaide lyle are pitch perfect in their presentation with each voice ringing painfully true to their respective lots in life as they contribute their individual pieces to the puzzle cash constructs throughout a captivating 320 pages similarly the descriptions of the lives and land are as colorfully painted and fully realized as it gets from the run down former general store with newspapered over windows that the shady pastor chambliss converts into his church to the ramshackle homes on the edge of tobacco fields to the distinctive rural southern dialect cash brings his beloved home state of north carolina vividly to life a land more kind than home is a smashingly triumphant debut one which will stay with you long after you've finished in fact don't be surprised to see a land more kind than home have the kind of staying power and lasting impression that lands it on more than a few \"best of 2012'' lists come year end","1015":"will write a review of this book after i talk about it at an upcoming reader's group meeting","1016":"stopped reading too graphic may try to finish started again i hope to finish this time if you have to stop a book is it worth trying to re start or when you put a book down are you finished","1017":"wiley cash has written an excellent debut novel of how curiosity in youth can go terribly wrong jess and his brother enjoy spying on people but it's always been in good fun but they're not prepared for dealing with the consequences of seeing something they were never meant to see","1018":"great characterization and sense of place didn't think the ending followed well tho'","1019":"look out world wiley cash has arrived this is an unbelievable debut novel wiley is brimming with incredible talent and is quite the storyteller after chapter one i could not put down the book it's tragic without being melodramatic finally as a southern appalachian i find that very few writers can capture the region without being offensive wiley nails the wnc region its people and dialect i'm honored that i can say i knew wiley cash back when","1020":"i really liked this book it was a sad story but well written","1021":"a really good book but i hate when they make you cry","1022":"this is a great debut by wiley cash the characters drew me in and the layered storyline held my interest cash's writing reminds me of cormac mccarthy in his rawness although cash seems a bit more stylistic my only complaint is i had a hard time determining the time period of the novel at times it seemed to be set in current day and other times it seemed like the 1950s perhaps this isn't a complaint but a compliment to the transcendence of cash's writing","1023":"i was lucky enough to get an advanced peek at wiley's debut novel and it's absolutely great","1024":"wiley cash's novel a land more kind than home deals with serious issues but with a very gentle voice set in the south carolina and based upon real facts this story feels more like a historical novel than a modern day novel narrated in the first person by the three lead characters the story gently and slowly unfolds leading to the horrific incident in the church and the aftermath for the community and the narrators there is no doubt that this is story telling at it's best but for me it was just a little too slow i found my mind wandering somewhat and like other reviewers i often struggled with the author's use of language yes it was authentic and realistic but the style of grammar and dialect took something away from my enjoyment of the book","1025":"an enjoyable read a wonderful story of loss and hope damage and recovery injury and healing of second chances and keeping on going when your world has suddenly crashed down around you i highly recommend this book to others","1026":"this is such an emotional read one that will stay with me a while told from the perspectives of all the main characters the lives of an entire family and a whole community are changed a rural north carolina community is the setting the dialogue is believable and the characters particularly the young boys seem completely authentic i am always attracted to first novels such as this it is fascinating to watch a skillful plot and cast of characters being built by an author who may be doing it for the first time i hope there is a second by this author","1027":"not a bad start to a writing career the plot is interesting enough although some of the ends are tied up a little too nicely in my opinion there is a positive ending which isn't bad but there is too little focus on the negative consequences of some of the later actions chambliss' character is chilling and the prospect of him being an entirely likely character is very frightening not great not bad","1028":"wow i loved this book can't wait to see what's next from this talented writer","1029":"fabulous interesting voices and great storytelling loved the ending no neat tying of the strings here","1030":"i really enjoyed this book i love the way the story is told from the point of view of three characters","1031":"using faulkner's technique from as i lay dying with the story told in separate chapters from different character perspectives except for the mute brother christopher aka stump as in faulkner's the sound and the fury the novel seemed stretched out to fit the traditional novel length it read like a mfa workshop piece written in in pieces and sewed together yet it was entertaining despite being watered down and pieced together a fast read","1032":"i loved this book from start to finish i liked hearing each of the narrators telling the story from their point of view it is such a simple story but it felt so real and so well written that i read this book in one day blizzard in ne this weekend i couldn't have asked for a better story to be snowed in with and i can't wait for this author's next book","1033":"dark tale of svengali like evangelical preacher's grip over a small town particularly one family great characters great tension though the ending was a bit simplistic and convenient","1034":"brilliant debut novel worthy of the accolades it has received","1035":"a 2013 staff fiction favorite recommended by andrea read her review https www goodreads com review show check our catalog http encore cooklib org iii encore","1036":"wow seriously fucked up tale centered around southern religious fanatics not a feel good book but holy crow is it intense","1037":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book while i did find that each of the characters could have used a bit more of a distinctive voice the author's voice rang very true to me the descriptions were vivid and the scene with the two young boys peering into the church in particular drew me in and made me feel as though i was right there the bond between the two brothers was an interesting one difficult to understand fully yet clear in an emotional sense","1038":"guh i really should know better than to read a southern novel about kids reading this thing was depressing on a watching a puppy burn to death a single frame at a time in super hd level i mean it was good but jesus wiley drink some lemonade and go to the park or something wiley cash is a great writer with a greater name seriously wiley cash some people are born with advantages","1039":" a five star first novel but overall a 4 star it was the first southern gothic i had read in a long time that caused my toes to curl hope to abound and tragedy to strike well done a bit rambling but as a first effort i will give it a pass i would have liked the perspective of either jess or clem in the final part but southern tradition would say 'enough said implying that the reader must determine the marginally loose ends the pov writing was very effective and well voiced a book worth reading the vernacular expressions were well chosen and well placed i will read the next one written","1040":"atmospheric earthy poetic and moving this isn't the kind of story i'd normally pick for myself yes you snake handling and jesus but i definitely enjoyed it","1041":"this was an amazing book narrated by several characters including a young boy this book was mesmerizing if you like southern fiction no if you like good fiction read this book it will break your heart but you'll be glad you read it","1042":" i loved this book told from three different voices the book is a story of religion adultery family brotherhood and tragedy one of the voices is that of jess hall a 9 year old boy who both looks up to and is protective of his older brother christopher or stump jess and stump become curious about the noises they hear in their mother's room and decide to peek a decision that sets off the devastating events that follow adeline lyle is another main voice in the novel she is an 80 year old woman who has left the church some 10 years prior to this story because of unspeakable events she has witnessed when she leaves she demands to take the children with her and now watches them at her home while parents attend church the final voice is that of the town sheriff a man whose life comes full circle by the end of the book this book is really quite tragic and painful but is beautifully written at times while reading it i can feel the moral conflicts that plague each of the readers and found myself thinking deeply about the choices we make","1043":"i thought that this would make a great book club read but it was not popular","1044":"this is a wonderful book so sad and touching wiley cash really knows how to pull your heart strings with this one jess's love for his brother really makes the book i only wish it had more justice in it bc what happens to a certain character wasn't good enough for me i don't want to spoil it but i wish it would have been slower that bastard i can't wait to read his next book","1045":"a land more kind than home wiley cash's first novel is set in a small mountain community preacher carson chambliss leads his devoted parishioners by a spirit that burns bright inside the small cloistered church they prove their worthiness by snake handling and poison drinking all is well until one day it all goes horribly wrong i liked the book very much it took a hold of me on page one and did not let me go until i had read the last word on the last page it's a goodread for sure","1046":"gripping story great writing","1047":"almost a 5 star book 4 1 2 would be a good rating very intense book i listened to it on cd which i would recommend the readers did a great job portraying the characters","1048":"ohmygosh so compelling i can't stop thinking about this book tragic gripping and eerie","1049":"well written engaging enjoyed it with tears","1050":"stories of appalachia have always appealed to me as some of my family reside there and i have spent some time visiting there in the 40's and 50's so this story resonated with me the written word replicates the broken speech patterns of this area as do many of the characters my only reserve was the character of the sheriff and his wife which was not in depth as was the character of the other main protagonists a very well written book which for me was a page turner","1051":"this was a wonderful book it's one of those that make you feel something in each page this is what every author strives for but it is rare to actually see the atmosphere with its southern gothic feel grabs you as soon as you read the first page you can sense tension in the pages in every line and you know that something brutal is about to happen the interesting thing is that when that brutality actually happens we are so invested in the characters that we feel it at an almost physical level something i do wish had been done differently though are the different character voices since we do switch viewpoints a lot throughout the book i do wish the characters had more distinct voices they are pretty similar even in expressing their own thoughts and i think the book would have been all the richer if there'd been an actual shift the reader could experience the writing though is gorgeous it is rather stark but so effective in its bareness i can definitely recommend this book to all of you who love literary fiction or even some of you who like the southern gothic genre i will be looking forward to this author's next novel","1052":"fantastic this book has everything from incredibly memorable characters to a plot that immediately draws you in","1053":"very good thriller about cruelty of those who preach extreme religion in appalachia and so much more i loved reading it at library","1054":"amazing debut novel evokes memories of watching american gothic with gary cole and lucas black only substitute evil preacher for evil sheriff i would have liked to see even more interaction between chambliss and the other characters cash gives the reader a great feel for all of the characters and tells a rich nuanced story","1055":"outstanding debut novel wiley cash tells a compelling story of a family in rural north carolina from the perspective of one of the children highly recommended","1056":"the beginning of this novel is disturbing so i almost chose not to continue but it was well worth the effort","1057":" this is an incredible novel this is wiley cash's first novel and if it is an indication of what to expect from him i am now a fan he has a strong southern voice which is definitely in my favorites genre with my love of eudora welty harper lee flannery o'connor et al the story is gripping it is one of those books that you can't put down but don't really want to end loved it i don't like spoilers so i am not going to put any in here but he employs multiple narrators and they all come across as strong and true and individual read this","1058":"a great story of family faith betrayal good u0026amp evil and forgiveness what a fantastic debut novel from cash can't wait until his next one","1059":"this was a deep an awesome story","1060":"this is the type of book that keeps you going to your local book store a debut novel recommended by the folks at diesel when i needed a new read set in appalachia the story absolutely grips you with the twists and turns of a few families in a small town one of the best books i read last year now coming out in paperback","1061":"i wanted to love this book but couldn't i probably would actually rate it 3 5 stars","1062":"a small pentecostal church in the mountains of north carolina is the setting and i would argue a character too of this wonderfully written novel it is about the church members who speak in tongues handle snakes and lay hands to heal it is also about a church that lets one man become so powerful that no one will stand up to him except for one women","1063":"although the storyline was incredibly sad i enjoyed reading the varying perspectives from the different characters my heart just broke for jess i didn't care for how the story ended again very sad story but very well written","1064":"3 5 stars i love novels by john hart and tom franklin so i looked forward to reading this book because of that comparison in the reviews it was good although i felt that it started rather slowly for me i downloaded and listened to an audio version the three narrators jess adelaide and clem the sheriff enhanced my enjoyment with their colorful colloquial and sometimes poetic prose this is a well written book that creates a suspense that will inevitably end in tragedy","1065":"i really liked the rotating first person narration good story line although i didn't love the ending just because it was unhappy also it took me well into jess's chapter to figure out he was a boy i had been picturing him in my head as a girl until the mom refers to him as son which really threw me for a loop","1066":" a land more kind than home by wiley cash is a heartbreaking and beautifully written story about religion family and a community who fail to protect a child i must admit the first thing that drew me to this book was its cover it is beautiful and i am a sucker for a pretty picture but this book is far from just a pretty cover picture it's the story of jess hall who watches in horror as his autistic brother is smothered during a healing service in the mountains of north carolina this novel is beautifully written and at 306 pages hardback version you know it's not going to take long to read the narrative is told in four voices jess a ten year old boy his father the town sheriff and adelaide an old woman who was the first to realise the evil of the church this is the sort of descriptive writing that is colourful and draws you right into a small town if north carolina and you can visualise the wonderful characters you can even smell the smells of north carolina and the author really does a good job on this noveli think if you liked the homecoming of samuel lake you will love this book","1067":"wiley cash is a good story teller and uses rich details in his writing the story left me wanting to more know about the mute brother the old healer and the salty grandfather the story could have been so much deeper","1068":"sometimes we just can't see what's right on front of us this novel could be set in any place on earth with the common bond of human error ignorance and maybe a little evil thrown in this is a book not about god but how dangerous man can be when he cloaks himself as godly","1069":"great book highly recommend on your summer reading list","1070":"i really liked it definitely would recommend this is the author's 1st book and i liked his writing style from the very first paragraph has some dark creepy parts though","1071":"great book i remember reading its reviews when it came out and while the reviews were great i didn't think i'd like the book holy roller types handling snakes in the west carolina mountains but it's a spectacular read with an elegantly told story it always amazes me when a book so sad can still be uplifting","1072":"southern flavor which means the pace is slow but that turns out to be okay as the story unfolds in fact it would lose something if the action occurred at an obviously faster pace the chapters and action flow some parts feel and are predictable however the book works because of its language and characterizations","1073":"a good piece of work but not compelling or fascinating to me the writing is dense with imagery the characters are all believable and well drawn but for me it just didn't do it too short for one thing i like to get my money's worth from amazon com and a bit of a cliche crazy preacher who plays with snakes fire and other men's wives young boy with a mute older brother etc not the best thing i've read this summer but certainly not the worst and worth a read from the library not amazon","1074":"this book was tremendous masterfully written suspenseful and emotionally honest the characters were drawn with such skill that they leaped from the page this one is a barn burner so so good","1075":"hard book to quantify seems like a tale stuck in the 1930s then suddenly a stark mention of a meth lab told from 3 povs an elderly woman a 9 y o boy and the town sheriff close attention to personalities all well developed i listened to this and the woman and sheriff were very well voiced the boy less so for me the author was trying so hard to maintain pov that a character couldn't report what that character didn't see or experience that the book was far too heavy with i heard i heard i heard when something happens out of sight as distracting as robert parker's constant drumbeat of i said he said she said a sad book true to life but sad still it was so well written and developed with a thoroughly hateful villain in the form of the snake handling self appointed preacher it rates with me","1076":"well written and it draws you into the small community in appalachia i am still thinking about the book a week later that is a good sign","1077":"i have just started this book and am pretty sure by it's end i will be giving it five stars and ranking wiley cash up there with ron rash and charles frazier as my favorite current authors all of them from western northern carolina as was thomas wolfe from whom cash got the title for this book loving it so far okay so i am giving it 4 stars not 5 still highly recommend a wonderful debut the end just felt about 2 chapters short but an awesome first effort","1078":" i was torn between rating this debut novel by wiley cash with 3 or 4 stars the story is superbly written and being from a small town nestled in the foothills of the applachian mountains of virginia not to far from the setting of this story i can relate to the characters and their way of life very well the only issue i had was the pace of the story of course this is a genre that normally runs slow for a dramatic piece it moves fairly steady through each characters segments it gives great background stories into each character and if you pay close enough attention to the foreshadowing you can figure out the ending long before it gets there my reason for giving a three star rating is based soley on the lack of thrills excitement this genre lacks 3 5 would be better suited my congrats though to mr wiley on a wonderful first novel","1079":"i am adding this novel to my list of favourite books from the first page i was drawn into the story and i couldn't put the book down the characters and setting reminded me of the john grisham's the last juror but wiley cash's story is so much deeper we have the past influencing the present relationships that are spoiled by misguided religion and fear it is a wonderful story","1080":"when i finished a land more kind than home i sat for a long time and thought about it there are so many nuances in the relationships of the book's characters all of which brings the characters to life there is so much sadness in this story it breaks your heart wiley cash is a talented author i hope his future works are as powerful as this debut novel","1081":"loved the beginning ending and the southern vibe but the middle was a little slow for me","1082":"loved this book","1083":"this book was very interesting to say the least still trying to figure out the deeper meaning i think i'm almost there but my conclusions are a bit disturbing maybe i'm trying to find a pearl of wisdom that's not really there idk it's a book i wouldn't necessarily recommend","1084":"very good quick read","1085":"i found this freshman offering to be equal parts tragic and beautiful to say much more gives away too much i very much look forward to reading cash's next offering","1086":"i have to say this first reads giveaway was only ok although the writing was decent and there were a few jaw dropping moments this novel is not particularly memorable too often the narrator strayed from the original story to tell a tidbit from the past and it ended up leaving me feeling disconnected from the action at hand the plot had potential but unfortunately fell short for me","1087":"you know when you finish a book and you look back on it with a sense of awe trying to better understand what you just finished that was this type of book the front cover compares it to to kill a mockingbird but even without that that guidance i think i would have come up with the comparison myself similar to how you could say that book is about scout and her relationship with her older brother and father when it's really so much more than that with this you could also say it's about jess and his relationship with his older brother and father except again it's so much more than that i believe the story takes place in the 1980s but everything feels so timeless about it that it's hard to tell if someone told me these events took place today i'd believe it or maybe even more amazing i'd also believe someone who said the book instead took place 100 years ago going into this i had no idea what to expect but i think that's the way to do it especially since as i started off with a basic summary isn't going to tell you what it's really about i will tell you that i cried through the last few chapters and know this is one i won't forget","1088":"excellent book faith is sometimes not believing","1089":"5 stars for the writing 1 star for the ending","1090":"this book is dark and disturbing but offers a glimpse into a different world and happenstances that carry so much sorrow it is a good read while not satisfying","1091":"well written and effective at putting you in that small town time and place however why must so many american novels peak at a bloodbath","1092":"coincidentally took this library book with me on vacation to asheville nc opened it first night there to discover the setting is you guessed it asheville nc interesting story written in dialect of the region and woven around religious beliefs and culture and how those beliefs can mislead an entire community beware the wolf in sheep's clothing is the moral of this story devastating results to those who fail to recognize him","1093":" powerful and haunting this novel is told in three voices one the voice of adelaide the town midwife and for lack of a better term sunday school teacher jess a young boy who like most young boys is curious and adventurous and clem the town sheriff with a family tragedy in his past the focal point is a mysterious church that keeps its storefront windows papered over so that no one can see inside the services revolve around snakes and its charismatic some would say creepy preacher the book weaves in and out of the character's back stories showing us the reasons for their intense religious pursuit their instinctual desire for violence and one woman's ability to delineate between a calling to god and the work of evil and her attempts to protect the town's children good story highly recommended","1094":"i loved this book the characters were real and although i pretty much knew where the story was going the tension kept building i did find the switching between voices a bit distracting at first but got used to it an excellent debut novel","1095":"beautifully written claustrophobic small town southern fiction wonderful","1096":"this novel is captivating wiley writes with simple easy to read prose a powerful story so intriguing that i actually read each word often i skip paragraphs in lesser books i eagerly await his next novel","1097":"beautifully told story of the naivete of those who seek solace in irrational beliefs as mencken so eloquently put it for every complex problem there's a simple solution and it's wrong tragedy evolves from the pursuit of simple solutions to complicated problems as it usually does wiley cash writes lyrically and credibly even though on the face of it what happens seems incredible a powerful story well told","1098":"intriguing engrossing plot with characters who weave a tale that keeps you turning the page long after you should be in bed

haunting excellent debut novel cash has the gift of prose reminiscent of the great southern writers","1105":"this book was just a total nothing to me it wasn't bad at all but i've already forgotten i read it i keep seeing the word thriller used to describe this book it was about as thrilling as a trip down the frozen foods aisle","1106":"i really liked this book a lot jess's description of his interactions with his brother and his understanding of his brothers' emotions without every speaking a word was sooooo intuitive and connected to him his loyalty to him and sense of emptiness when he lost him was heart breaking the authors' choice of words to describe this young boys' observations of his world and the always under lying sense of dread was amazing i wanted to keep reading and i didn't very well written","1107":"a steady gritty novel set in the back country of north carolina where tobacco farming rules and shameless swindlers tout the word of god while backing up their word with venomous snakes the dark atmosphere gives the book a heavy grip and it's hard not to want the characters to somehow conquer when you know there's really no hope jess hall is the 9 year old younger brother to his mute brother stump their father is a tobacco farmer while their mother spends her time in the company of the local snake wielding preacher stump and jess become witness to an event that leads stump into tragic circumstances and forces jess to grow up much faster than he should the story is told from the point of view of jess sheriff clem and town resident adelaide their differing viewpoints round out the layers of the story and add emotional depth that makes things just that much more heartbreaking each one has a distaste for the preacher but the real emotions come from their history with each other there's level to which no one wants to interfere in the lives of others but it comes back to just cost them more it isn't a book with a happy ending it isn't a book that you'll fly through but it's a book that will make you want to sit in a dark room and feel every ounce of pain for these characters your heart will break but this is a book you'll want to pass on to everyone you know","1108":"a page turner for sure","1109":"the story was gripping and heart rending but real life cash is able to put you right there in the room with the characters you can see what they see hear what they hear you really know these people he gets there voices just right","1110":"when i thought about what words to use to describe this book i looked at its cover and it says

town","1112":"one of the best books i've read in a long time absolutely captivating","1113":"thank you wiley cash for writing a perfect can't put it down novel what great storytelling it keeps moving along and never gets bogged down even though the author masterfully develops each character while weaving a dark suspenseful tale","1114":"wiley cash's debut novel is a rich tale of deceit mistrust yet hope and healing a land more kind than home focuses on a small southern town in the close past to the early 1900s the main story tellers are jess a nine year old boy adelaide lyle midwife and clem barefield town sheriff the characters of adelaide lyle and clem barefield weave tales of the past while the three characters share the telling of tale in the present there are reptiles only some are people and lots of people talking about god's will jess couldn't help looking through the crack into the church where his mute brother stump was adelaide stood by the children in the church and removed them out of fear to me it is a tragedy along the lines of other southern literature this book is remarkable for several reasons the book highlights the people in the hills and hollers of appalachia with their dogged determination to survive the tragedy in the book is not without redemption the descriptive language of the author in places is so clear that you can see in your mind's eye what is being described i will be looking for more of wiley cash's stories this book will be placed between to kill a mockingbird and the story of edgar sawtelle","1115":" i loved this book from the very beginning the book starts with adelaide telling how she is waiting to see pastor carson chambliss at the church a church that she hasn't set foot in for many years after a meeting in which snakes were used had gone wrong the church's windows are covered up with newspaper and no outsider knows what is going on inside adelaide is such a honest and thoroughly decent old lady that i couldn't help liking her from the start jess is very likeable too he is nine years old and he knows more about what is going on than the adults around him realise the reader knows what he knows and hopes he will tell an adult already the sheriff is a strange character but not unfriendly he had had dealings with jess' family before which play a large role in how he deals with the situation at hand the book is a kind of mystery but just as much an observation of small town living the reader doesn't know exactly what happened but we do know that jess has important information if only he is willing to share it well written with a bit north carolina flavor in the way the people talked i liked the alternating of narrators which meant that the reader saw the story from different viewpoints the story picked up with each narrator where the other had left off or sometimes repeated the descriptions of some of the events through their own eyes a wonderful read from the first page to the end","1116":"i love southern literature and i grew up in the deep south during the 1960s and '70s i've spent a lot of time in the region of nc in which this book is set i can't believe this is a first novel it's pitch perfect in sense of place character development and distinctive voices of all narrators an utterly absorbing and heartbreaking story i'm so glad i have the sudio version the readers are amazing and add so much dimension to an already superb work of literature i can't wait for more from wiley cash","1117":"i loved this book the story is told in 3 distinct voices it is a heart wrenching story with various flashback i didn't mind the extra bits as i believed they added depth to the main story i think this one will sit with me for a while","1118":"really enjoyed the story and the different personality of the main characters being from n c and spending several summers in hot springs and marshall really brought this book to life for me i will look forward to wiley cash's next novel","1119":"interesting topic and i liked how the author used three narrators a child an elderly women and a sheriff to unfold the story","1120":"another nc writer well written story of a community's response when a young disabled boy dies during a church service narrated by 3 distinct characters male and female youth and elder a nice addition to southern fiction complete with redemption forgiveness guns too much alcohol and a touch of crazy","1121":"i liked it a preacher in a southern town gone bad a young boy trying to make sense of his family and town captivated by him","1122":"what an incrediable novel this was i was captured from the very first paragraph this novels story is told from the prespective of three characters addie an elder of the church the sheriff and a nine year old boy they all witness a tragedy but from different points of few what an incredible read i gave it 5 on the ratings and highly recommend","1123":"this is a case where for me the reviews were so much better than the book i found the flashbacks were intrusive i didn't care much about any of the characters the setting was described with attention to detail i had to force myself to finish it and then thought the ending was cheesy","1124":" while tooling around goodreads i've discovered that a lot of people felt that this novel was too tangential full of anecdotal asides that serve no purpose in the larger story being told i couldn't disagree with this assessment more i was pretty impressed with this novel from its first pages to my mind the anecdotal asides help to make the final story a larger story than the one wiley cash wants you to think he intends to tell this story starts out to be frightening treatise on backwoods religion and ultimately becomes a moving tale of revenge the tale of two men hindered by the tragic loss of their sons i eagerly wait the next novel that wiley cash decides to publish","1125":"this first novel has a gracefully narrative that is deceptively simple the author draws you into the setting and makes you part of it there is one scene toward the end that is unsettling as to whether or not it is vengeance that has been festering or necessary to complete the tragedy","1126":"this was my pick for book group and i knew nothing except for what i read on the cover we all really enjoyed it and had a great discussion i'd be tempted to

fall in love with it but i enjoyed it some sad themes and i thought the ending was a bit jarring compared to the rest of the book after a sleepy pace most of the way through it suddenly went into overdrive but the characters felt real and my heart broke for jess the boy at the center of the story","1147":"a good story set in north carolina with an interesting cast of characters including an

years first taking office in 1961 barefield sets the events in the story in 1986 madison county is as far west in north carolina as you can get butting against the border of tennessee marshall is the county seat a patchwork of deep wooded valleys and steep mountains tobacco farmers in the western region of the state produce burley tobacco on farms hewed out of land more reminiscent of a network of roller coasters than agriculture marshall nc county seat of madison countyfolks in the appalachians are god fearing passing through if the spirit moves you you won't have a problem finding a church but i'd recommend steering clear of churches in old grocery stores and gas stations especially if the name of the church ends in the words in signs following folks put their faith on exhibition by handling serpents drinking strychnine and handling fire to see if it'll burn'em inside a church of christ with signs followingadelaide lylenow you take the church in this book it didn't start out that way once upon a time it was the french broad church of christ in a real cburch with pews and a steeple headed up by pastor matthews but the cancer got him back in 75 then along comes this fellow from out of nowhere name of carson chambliss it didn't take long for about half the congregation to up and leave when chambliss took over pastoring without half the congregation the bank took the church and sold it to the presbyterians that was fine with chambliss who moved the church down to the old grocery store and papered the windows so nobody passing by could see what was going on inside that building chambliss put up a sign by the road at the edge of the parking lot and changed the name to river road church of christ in signs following now you remember what i told you about those churches ending their name in signs following underneath the name of the church he painted mark 16 17 18 that's those verses that say you got faith you can pick up serpents drink poison and the holy ghost will keep you safe i'd seen people i'd known just about my whole life pick up snakes and drink poison hold fire up to their faces just to see if it would burn them holy people too that hadn't ever acted like that a day in their lives but chambliss convinced them it was safe to challenge the will of god jess halli'm nine and my brother is eleven his name is christopher but everybody calls him stump he's never said a word he's bigger than me but i'm the leader we live with mama and daddy daddy grows tobacco when he hangs it in the barn and it dries out it smells so good stump and i get in trouble with mama when we snoop there's things we shouldn't know about one day stump and me were outside and heard the noises mama and daddy make sometimes when we're told to go outside and play stump climbed up on the rain barrel but it wasn't daddy in there making those noises i saw mama's preacher leave the house and he looked at me and stump i didn't tell daddy about the noises on sunday mama went down to the church like she always does daddy doesn't go instead of leaving us at sunday school with miss adelaide mama took stump with her i wanted to go but she wouldn't let me only stump she took him to night church too i don't know what happened but stump died daddy got so mad at the men from church that brought stump home he hit them and hit them clem barefieldtwenty five years next month that's how long i've been sheriff here in madison county my grandfather was sheriff over in henderson county and my father farmed apples there hendersonville flat rock they're little more than an hour away but living here is as close to living in a different world as you can get no matter how old you get people here are different they're superstitious know the old mountain ways religion is so thick in the hills and hollers up here you can stir it with a stick but i haven't had a reason to set foot inside a church in more years than i can count especially after my son jeff died it's not natural for a man to outlive his son jeff and ben hall were friends good friends ben settled down married became a good farmer a good provider there's calls you get that don't amount to nothin' then there's those you get you can't forget my wife sheila handed me the phone and it was robby my deputy telling me ben hall's boy stump was laying dead up at adelaide lyle's house killed in that damned church over on river road sheila told me not to let things get out of hand there's some times though you can't keep from gettin' out of hand specially when that damned crazy preacher chambliss is at the bottom of things how the hell does a boy get killed in a church why in the hell do you kill a child who is incapable of speaking a word the reviewerwiley cash can write he can tell a story cash began a land before time while a graduate student in louisiana his mentor as he worked on his dissertation was ernest gaines what an opportunity ernest gaines i love me some ernest gaines' bookseveryone seems to love this book cash is one of the new darlings of the publishing world his interview with vanity fair is entitled author wiley cash on being the \"justin timberlake of american literature http www vanityfair com online dail the dust jacket gleams with blurbs to the point you'd think this book came wrapped in stars clyde edgerton said it would knock your socks off gail godwin said it was like stepping into a greek tragedy ernest gaines' blurb is a little bit more interesting although it begins with a glow it dims to a weak glimmer i think this could be the beginning of a long fruitful career in an interview with brad wetherell in fiction writers review cash said he got the basic idea of his plot from a newspaper clipping about a young autistic boy being smothered during a healing ceremony in a store front church in chicago cash wanted to move it south to north carolina http fictionwritersreview com inter i wish i could love this book as many reviewers and readers seem to however as well as cash can cause the reader to keep turning the pages he leaves some mighty big gaps in his story how was chambliss chosen as the new minister at the ill fated church how did chambliss manage to convert a church of christ into an unquestioning foot stompin' snake handlin' strychnine drinkin' fire handlin' bunch with such ease sure this is a work of fiction but even writers of fiction might do a little research about an area in which so much documentation exists such as the holiness church movement bottom line there are few converts to serpent handling these churches found up through appalachia consist of small congregations which include descendants of the original founding members they don't grow into practicing churches overnight cash should read salvation on sand mountain snake handling and redemption in southern appalachia by dennis covington cash is being touted as the next tom franklin sorry franklin never left so many gaps in a story i think ernest gaines is right this book could be the beginning of a fruitful career or it could turn into a series of incredulous stories the choice is cash's i wouldn't discourage anyone from reading this book i

of the ingredients i love in a good literary fiction book southern voices dysfunctional families questioning of god and religion and precocious kids i really wanted to love it but i didn't perhaps it was the multi cast narration i listened to the audio version and only one of the readers was palatable that put me off but i found that the most interesting characters were the ones who never told their sides of the story that left me wanting i longed to hear the pastor reveal his motivations for bringing serpents and childrens together in his church mostly i wanted to hear from stump the young boy who never uttered a word in his whole life","1152":"this is a very compelling book very hard to put down and the characters stay with you","1153":"good southern story about a a self proclaimed

that period of time the complexities of evil and religion to the simple joy of brothers and fireflies it's a must read highly recommend","1158":"this book was a total page turner it's not an edge of your seat action or mystery but there is enough going on with the tragedy of the death of a young boy that it keeps you wanting to know what will happen next as a result i liked the rural north carolina setting and the characters were perfectly matched for it i also loved how the author told the story by alternating chapters with the view point of various critical people involved in the events","1159":"this was a good book set in the south it had the feel of to kill a mockingbird as far as the secrets there was a little something missing though that made me rate it 3 vs 4 stars the

interesting all working to keep my curiosity my only disappointment was the end i was expecting a spectacular conclusion after such a great start still loved it though great storytelling","1161":" this story of two young brothers in a small southern town is told in such a way that it is as if the reader is spying on the story through various cracks and peepholes multiple narrators each give us their own little slice of the story and it takes quite a while before it is clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are except one who seems pretty much bad from the get go very well crafted and much better than the jacket copy a mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western north carolina town makes it sound i think it is really much more a story about how each person's weaknesses and strengths and the choices those lead them to color the lives of those around them","1162":" very well written but sometimes the words got in the way of moving the story along when reading a book with a very compelling storyline it can be a bit frustrating to wade through the descriptive passages even when they are so well crafted in your haste to find out what happened this was such a book for me i find it a bit disjointed when an author switches between several characters to tell the story as was done in this book just when i am wanting to hear more from the boy jess adelaide the aging midwife takes over and when i am getting used to her voice the sheriff picks up the tale not saying this doesn't work just that i find it to be annoying sometimes the author has told a good story with characters to like some to despise and some to puzzle over i couldn't wait to see how it would end i didn't like the way it ended wanting more of a conclusion after the violence in the final chapters i wanted more of jess what his future held how his grandfather would handle this second chance but when i pick up a book that keeps me page turning to the very last sentence i have to call that a good read","1163":"rating details * 5 072 ratings * 1 139 reviews a stunning debut reminiscent of the beloved novels of john hart and tom

communities where families stick together and seldom see the need to wander far from the ridges and valleys where they were born this story is about one such community not far from my home in asheville the story is told from the perspective of several of the main characters in turn as the events happened and how the knowledge they each held might have changed the outcome of this tragedy a series of seemingly common and random events come together in a child's mind and then the dominoes start to fall and the whole thing starts to come apart an old woman with knowledge of the truth has kept the secret for over twenty years one small child who sees but doesn't tell and another that sees but can not tell a cheating wife a snake handling preacher and a long absent grandfather all play a role as the story unfolds secrecy and lies tear the town apart and there is enough guilt and blame for everyone in the community to share this is truly a good read...and they say most first time authors write about what they know well i have little doubt that this story might have been true and passed along to wiley cash by a family member or friend the way histories are passed by mountain

church this was the very reason children were not supposed to be there in the first place christopher is a mute and has been all his life his brother jess and he are always together one day when they

night i look forward to reading what else mr cash has to offer","1170":"i did not enjoy this book but not because it wasn't well written it was but it made me so sad i almost would have given it two stars but it's a well told story and that would have been unfair to the author i just don't enjoy tragic stories related to children","1171":" i was so impressed with this book by wiley cash it has a plot that makes it hard to stop reading memorable characters and it is beautifully written it is one of those books that i found myself thinking about long after i had finished reading it the story is told by three main characters but it is jess who i find myself thinking about the most cash does such a great job of bringing him to life and it was heartbreaking at times to read about all of the things that happen to him and his family the descriptions of pastor chambliss and the things that go on his church were difficult for me to read it is hard for me to even try to understand their reasonings for what they did this book is definitely a page turner and i found the ending to be suspenseful and emotional i would highly recommend this book it is a thoughtful story about faith family heartbreak and forgiveness i it is a book that i will continue to be thinking about for a long time","1172":" wiley cash's first novel a land more kind than home is a reader's delight what a storyteller he is i was transported to a time which most of us may think of as long ago but is still alive in the rural mountains of north carolina living in nc i felt this book spoke to what i have come to know told from the perspective of 3 different characters this heartbreaking and sometimes hard to read story unravels and carries the reader away the prose is wonderful and he captures the speech and cadence of the mountain people along with their strong beliefs and personalities his descriptions allowed me see these people and the surroundings perfectly in my minds eye my other senses were on high alert as well smelling the earth and the sweat hearing the river the church singing and praise the rain and anguished sobs this is not a feel good story it is full of tradgedy with very little triumph though just possibly a sliver of redemption i cared about these people and thought of them long after i closed the book to me that is a sign of a great novel congratulations mr cash i look forward to your next","1173":" a land more kind than home by wiley cash is one of the best stories i have read in some time it definitely is a waking up with dark circles worthy book to read i liked how the author chose to tell the story from three different voices the young son jess the sheriff of the small town clem and adelaide a neighbor who knows everyone and everything that goes on she helps the people in the town in many ways she is the town midwife watches the children at the church on sundays and allows others when needed to stay at her home this story is a heart wrenching story about a dysfunctional mountainous town in north carolina and a young family that lives there having two sons of my own and also having taught 9 year olds i wanted to just enter the story to give a big hug to console jess the son with so much sadness and worry upon his young shoulders wiley cash through his phenomenal use of descriptive words was able to make me feel like i knew the characters personally his vivid descriptions of the setting help to provide a visual of the setting i especially enjoyed the part when jess finds the quiet box and all the contents that are inside of it this quiet box was used by his mom to provide peace and solace for stump it brought me to tears i found it amazing how this so called pastor could have such control over the members of the church it brought back memories of the sect of jim jones and how he was able to coerce those at jonestown to drink poisoned punch wiley cash needs to take a bow because i give him a standing ovation for his beautifully written debut novel i highly recommend that you add this book to your list to read you won't be disappointed","1174":"excellent tale of the religious extreme very well written","1175":"any book that gives me a snake handling preacher i'm on it","1176":"hard to believe this is a debut novel he has a talent for capturing the voice of each character narrator","1177":"a beautiful southern gothic novel this book keeps you on the edge of your seat and dread and nervousness await you as you read it's gorgeous i had been disappointed with npr recommendations of late but they totally redeemed themselves with this one it was so much better than i hoped read it","1178":"it kept my attention and was an easy read but not my favorite it was kind of depressing and the ending kind of pissed me off","1179":"runs into a few lulls in the middle but the story is riveting when it deals with carson chambliss the demonic snake handling pastor could have done without the bit about adelaide's dream about her great aunt jess's escape from his friend's bully of a brother etc but it is lots of fun to learn more and more about the horrible paster clem barefield is a great narrator although i couldn't help but see him as a knock off of sheriff bell from no country for old men","1180":"cash's storytelling pulled me in immediately through the voices of the three narrators all the characters and their lives became real and full he made me care deeply about them","1181":"this is the debut book for this author and i had trouble putting it down it describes a death in a small town and the story is weaved together from the viewpoints of 3 main characters i look forward to this author's next book","1182":"excellent debut novel highly recommended","1183":" this was a great book it kept me interested throughout the characters and perspectives were well laid out the tone of the book reminded me a lot of bloodroot it brings out the darker side of childhood and the demons that can destroy it but it does it so well that it almost makes you respect the darker aspects of life it almost makes them beautiful it's sort of like a greek tragedy but set in more modern times it surely has the dark beauty of a greek tragedy and it is just as accessible with some underlying themes that almost anyone can understand if not relate to the writing itself is excellent and i really liked the writing style it moves from one character to the next each well fleshed out and each with a viewpoint that feels unique and genuine definitely read this one","1184":"the story unfolded in a can't put it down pace but i was most impressed by wiley cash's narrators each of the three voices 9 year old jess spinster miss lyle and the crusty sheriff were clearly defined and unmistakably unique cash excelled most with the voice of jess whose child's understanding and descriptions of ugly adult acts was impressive and whose narrations showed more than they told of the events","1185":" this book is told by three people jess a young boy adelaide lyle a midwife and llem barefield a sheriff two boys jess and his brother christopher see something in a church that they really should not have seen here's a little teaser from this book for you from page 260 maybe that's why they were trying to heal him joe bill said maybe they wanted him to talk so he could confess his sins and go to heaven when he died i found this book to be pretty good although it was mostly dialog without much action it's a quick read gerard's review","1186":" i wanted to like this book and perhaps i'm being too hard on it however i found the author often resorting to simile's to make the story sound more profound i found these similes distracting the book is also filled with metaphors that are too obvious again as if trying to make the story more profound the story culminates in a sorrowful ending that holds one's attention but rather than finding sympathy for the characters i found them ineffectual and childlike the book does avoid the ubiquitous child who behaves more like an adult than any of the adults but that does not make any of the adults more effectual decisions easy to make by several adults would have prevented the terrible ending and since the decisions that would have prevented the ending were so easy to make there is little sympathy for the adults speaking out or informing others of information that they possessed would have been easy and at no cost to them so why didn't they do it in the end you are sad about the ending and mad that the adults did not make easy decisions oh well on to the next book","1187":"it's an easy thing to write a strong review for \"a land more kind than home\" this is wiley cash's first novel and it's a good one i can't wait to see what else he will write the book relates the story of nine year old jess hall and his family and community jess is one of three narrators who take turns telling events that happen in a small north carolina town the characters are vividly portrayed in this poignant tale of good and evil of tragedies and ultimately of hope","1188":" this book demonstrates how a desperate need for something whether that need is for something to believe in forgiveness or salvation can warp our decision making and our morality cash uses fanatic religious practitioners to articulate that in our need to believe in something or someone we can easily be led astray as our judgement becomes cloudy with a desire to please and be pleased through an extreme situation cash reminds us that when we begin to blindly follow someone we begin to develop a group think which can lead us to ignore the rights and needs of the ones closest to us in order to conform to the group along those lines there are hints of orwellian ideas throughout with a priest acting as a big brother figure all in all this is a very interesting and compelling book as both a story and metaphor for larger issues in society","1189":"couldn't put this book down cash does well capturing southern appalachia without being stereo typical this gritty tragedy is a great first novel for cash looking forward to reading more from wiley cash","1190":"this book was amazing","1191":"review to come","1192":"this was a very good book solid characters and good research a very good study of what happens when fanatic religion family and sorrow all meet in one place","1193":"well written riveting and interesting characters i just discovered a new author","1194":"i thought this book had more promise than execution cash relies too heavily on southern archetypes and i felt i could see what narrative moves lay ahead well before they actually appeared in the story that said it's a debut novel and worth the read if you like solid country noir crooked preachers and the like i'm also ready to read what cash comes up with next","1195":"this book opens with a quote from thomas wolfe about 'death' and how it could be 'a land more kind than home' sounds macabre but it is not but it held my attention liked it alot","1196":" i really wanted to love this book but i can only give it 2 5 stars the story is good and it contains more that enough twists and turns to keep my attention but the writing itself detracted and distracted from the story first much of the book is overwritten in once scene joe bill's grandpa makes him a peanut butter sandwich joe bill states he watched me pull out my chair and sit down i picked up a piece of bread and took a bite he'd put that peanut butter on there thick and the bread stuck to the roof of my mouth and i had a hard time swallowing it i stood up from the table and got me a glass from the cabinet and went to the refrigerator for the milk i sat my glass on the counter and poured the milk until my glass was full and then i put the milk back into the refrigerator and carried my glass to the table this seems like a superfluous amount of words to communicate i got up and got a glass of milk sometimes less is more secondly much of the story is told in flashbacks and dreams that disrupt any sense of continuity within the novel by way of example two boys are playing basketball on a dirt court when joe bill asks jess what is your grandpa's house like jess answers it's okay i guess then mid game jess gives the reader a six page description of the only time jess has been to his grandpa's house before passing the ball back to joe bill because only the tenses have changed the narrative is disjointed and jumpy finally the dialogue is over written or over edited or over something i don't know each chapter is told by a different character in that character's own voice which works most of the time but then there are some really strange sentences i watched them roll over her knuckles where her fingers kneaded the chair against which her body leaned and the clear glass above the sink through which the sunlight poured who talks like that i've never been to rural north carolina but i'm pretty sure these are sentences crafted by someone who has spent too much time studying grammar and that is totally inconsistent with the characters in this story all told i would still recommend the story for someone who wants a quick read but i'm too disappointed with the writing to give it more than 2 stars","1197":"wiley did a signing and talk at blue bicycle books in charleston sc where i work i was intrigued enough to pick it up during some slow hours the next day i couldn't put it down the story moves effortlessly from character to character and the dialogue is strong","1198":"an exciting debut novel told from many perspectives the writing is clean and lovely a great quick read that haunts you","1199":"the story and characters never leave the page too much like a creative writing exercise would have liked to know what was the appeal of the snake handling preacher or what made the bond strong between young brothers jess and christopher stump what formed adelaide's character there was too much description of nature and actions and too little insight will be interested to see if cash can grow","1200":"faulkner esque book complete with miscellaneous dead bodies about religious fervor in a small town i'm not sure why i didn't like this more granted try as i might i don't like faulkner so that could be the reason i absolutely loved the first 25% and the last 25% but in the middle i struggled to get through the author does a fantastic job of setting the scene the environment and its characters are well told and thoroughly felt this is billed as a \"mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small north carolina town\" but the brother bond seemed a very small aspect of the book and i didn't get the thriller part at all maybe this was not the right book for a shifting narrative that said adelaide lyle was my favorite of the narrators so perhaps the book would've been missing something without her voice overall well written but in the end it didn't grab me or only grabbed me very loosely","1201":"interesting southern novel enjoyed how the story unfolded through the 3 perspectives","1202":"like a lot of kids jess and his mute brother christopher \"stump\" are curious about the world of adults they're not above spying to satisfy their curiosity either one day stump witnesses something that will change their lives and their community forever a land more kind than home by wiley cash is a superb novel that just oozes atmosphere set in the mountains of western north carolina the book tells the story of a region and its people and cash gets both perfect i've lived near that part of the country for a while and i appreciated the quality of the dialogue and the sense of place in this wonderful novel the story is told from the points of view of jess sheriff clem barefield and adelaide lyle a pillar of the church and the community through their different perspectives readers are able to piece the story together as they learn of the past and secrets kept it's a story fraught with tension that had me on the edge of my seat it's hard to believe this is cash's debut novel because his writing ranks right up there with the best southern authors this book is sure to be one of my favorites of the year i listened to the audio version and thought it was just wonderful it's narrated by nick sullivan lorna raver and mark bramhall and they all do a marvelous job they get the accents and the rhythm of the area just right the audio version lasts about nine hours and the time just flew as i listened to it a land more kind than home is a book you don't want to miss i have a feeling it's the start of something big for cash","1203":" an amazing accomplishment by this first time author wiley deftly deals with issues of religion alcoholism and isolation in small remote communities of usa as a bookseller i'm given so many books and hard as i try i don't get to read everything despite our rep's assurance that this is a special book and let's face the rep's are always saying that my copy sat at the bottom of a big pile for a long time before one day i lent it to my girlfriend and she came back raving still my copy remained forgotten unread ignored then my husband sick of continuously tripping over my books boxed a whole heap and marked them for donation i managed to rescue some and that's when i finally got to read a land more kind than home i read it in a single week i stopped my life for it i made excuses to go to bed early and read it till my vision blurred and still wished it would not end my one and only criticism of wiley well maybe two is that i would liked to have seen the pastor play a bigger role in the climax of the book his part felt fizzed out especially after all the build up that preceded it i also struggled with wiley's decision to write all his character's in the first person in his defence the chapters do state whose view point the reader is taking even so i sometimes had to go back to the start of the chapter to check which character i'm reading about a land more kind than home is a book well worth reading it does not disappoint and should you see it on a shelf in a bookstore don't hesitate buy it","1204":"the story of a family torn apart by their mute son stump and the church that tried to heal him this story is told from the perspectives of several different characters namely the nine year old brother jess of the soon to be dead mute son after spying on adults stump and jess see something they shouldn't have and it leads to stump's healing","1205":"i liked this one fine but not as much as everyone else it seems it reminded me a lot of crooked letter crooked letter which i loved what i really did enjoy about this one was the effortless appearance of cash's writing nothing ever felt forced and typically i'm not a fan of dialect but this just worked it was so subtly executed that it never felt tried or in the way good read for book groups","1206":" finally a good southern half way gothic that i can recommend to almost everyone i know without regard to whether they will view me as a psychopath after the first 50 pages this one reminds me of crooked letter crooked letter in that a hefty chunk of the story was told through the eyes of a 9 year old boy a boy mind you who must confront emotions of just about every shade of tragedy without revealing any spoilers let's just say you'll be rooting for this kid i especially liked the somewhat firefox series flavor being intertwined snake handling with signs following churches roots that cure you people who come off the mountain to discover the world at large ain't quite like how they were brung up babies delivered by medicine women who adhere to what most today would declare outlandish practices it's obvious cash has a grip on the mountainous communities of western nc where this all takes place one of those corners of our country that still might seem untouched by time and progress to the untrained observer after reading this one you find its come quite a way or not depending on your perspective from where it might have been 60 years prior for me its a 4 5 debut novel that has me hoping for a follow up from this author in the not so distant future","1207":"more accurately 3 1 2 stars i enjoyed jess and adelaide as narrators but not clem so much interesting subject matter haunting upsetting but with an ending that makes the reader believe good things will come in the future","1208":"i liked the story although it was very sad and frustrating at times however i'm not a huge fan of books that have pages and pages of descriptions in them it's just a personal preference i've seen a creek in the country i can imagine how the water flows i don't need 500 words on the matter but for a first book it was great and again the story was wonderful so if descriptive passages are your thing then i would highly recommend it","1209":"the ending is what kept it from getting a third star","1210":"tough read loved the story from different characters' viewpoints","1211":"cash's writing was very good and the story has all the elements of a great american tragedy but it's a book that academics will like more than the rest of us","1212":" i review wiley cash's first novel \"a land more kind than home\" after one of those healings years ago an elderly woman died but her death could never be directly connected to the church since her body was dumped in her own garden but now jess's brother christopher has died and jess may have been a witness adelaide who is deeply mistrustful of chambliss has tried to protect the children from him following the woman's death she considers chambliss \"the face of evil \" eventually she finds herself part of barefield's investigation soon accident betrayal and violence emerge in a remarkable tale that falters primarily because two of the narrators -- jess and sheriff barefield -- prove less than credible as characters go to my blog have words will write 'emand then to the boston globe joe","1213":"this book kept me interested enough to keep reading however i am still trying to decide whether i liked it or not i can definitely say that i do not like carson chambliss at all this is one tear jerker of a book and i was quite shocked with the ending http dragonflowersandbooks blogspot","1214":"southern literature at its finest not one i will forget soon","1215":"an excellent first novel i cannot wait to read the next the next one by this author the author is able to express complicated ideas and situation in simple terms","1216":"i enjoyed the author's writing style as much as i enjoyed the plot","1217":" this was a great book i liked his writing style and he did a great job developing the characters the story was narrated in the first person by three different characters giving you their perspective this does not always work well in books but he did a great job doing it i love a book that can truly draw out emotions from me and this one did that very well anger at the mother for what she did and that she puts herself first love for these young boy who witnessed an act he should not have and anger at the evil preacher using a church for evil pleasure i highly recommend this book and am looking forward to future books from wiley cash","1218":"characters and setting remind me of ron rash's books lacks the depth and surprise endings of rash predictable and a story you've probably read or seen on screen before loved the last few pages because they did dig deep but wish there had been more of that throughout the book","1219":"the best book i've read so far this year a land more kind than home is about faith betrayal misuse of power loss of innocence an excellent book","1220":"a thought provoking book to read evil comes in many forms and in this book evil comes cloaked under the local minister a one time convict i read this for a book club and it should lead to a good discussion this is the author's first book and i look forward to his next novel","1221":"incredible i couldn't put this book down the story takes place in north carolina some time in the 60's is my best guess a tragedy occurs and there is more to follow as those responsible try to cover up the events leading up to a young boy's untimely death the author's descriptions of the times places and events pulled me into this book and i felt i could see the story taking place i will be thinking about this book for weeks to come","1222":" i usually love stories set in the appalachian mountains i also really enjoy stories told from various points of view so i started out loving this book told by three different characters who were all engaging telling a compelling story but somewhere along the way this book just lost it's pull on me it seemed to become plodding rather than spellbinding and i finished it feeling very disappointed i do think this author has potential as the first half to two thirds of the book set an intriguing stage and was very well written","1223":"good story a couple of twist's very quick read","1224":"3 5 really religion cult leaders snake handlers all fascinating stuff i just wish there was more emphasis on why the characters are who they are and do what they do and less time spent on less interesting sub plots e g the dad's relationship with his father the sheriff's loss of his son","1225":" check out the full review at kritters ramblingsset in rural north carolina with a different kind of church at the center this book took the reader into a part of the country that isn't in the news that often jess and his older brother christopher have been kept out of the church meetings with the rest of the children by the aid of an elderly women and one of the three narrators miss lyle jess is the second narrator and the third is a police detective by the name of clem barefield these three narrators each have a different perspective on this story and help it to unfold seamlessly","1226":"this review has been hidden because it contains spoilers to view it click here i'd also give this book 3 5 stars it was engaging and the pacing was spot on i read this book quickly and had late nights where i just didn't feel like putting it down that being said i didn't find the story overly brilliant i'd recommend to friends but wouldn't buy a copy for my personal library as one reading is enough for me i felt that the sheriff's pov chapters were the least engaging and the boy jess's chapters to be the most emotionally riveting his situation is downright heartbr i'd also give this book 3 5 stars it was engaging and the pacing was spot on i read this book quickly and had late nights where i just didn't feel like putting it down that being said i didn't find the story overly brilliant i'd recommend to friends but wouldn't buy a copy for my personal library as one reading is enough for me i felt that the sheriff's pov chapters were the least engaging and the boy jess's chapters to be the most emotionally riveting his situation is downright heartbreaking adelaide was also an engaging character what i would have loved is a few chapters from jess' mother i would love to get inside that woman's head and see what it was about her home life or past that may have driven her decisions that lady was a piece of work my biggest complaint would be that i felt the situation with the church resolved in a far too tidy way i think reality would have thrown the churchgoers in this community more internal hurdles also not being from this area of the united states i have no concept of what the alternative church presence is what church did jess' dad consider himself a part of where were those people in jess' life the time period was not well stated either i finished reading the book and realized that i had to go back to the start to re check the time period my book club all thought it was the 60's and the costumes i imagined for jess and his mother could be 60's but the true time setting is mid 1980s i would have had a different picture of the dress and vehicles had i absorbed this at the start my 3 5 stars are mostly there for the fact that there was something about this book that enticed me to read it at a record speed for a book club selection i continued to reflect on this read well after i turned the last page which is always a plus more","1227":" i like to pick up the amazon books of the month and this was one of the fiction books of the month i am not a huge fan of southern lit but mr cash writes beautifully about the people and landscapes of the blue ridge mountain region in north carolina the book is a very quick read i finished it in a day so the plot moves along quickly however i actually felt like i wanted more from this novel perhaps telling the story from the perspective of the three narrators chosen vs an omniscient pov left me feeling that there were questions unresolved nevertheless a solid debut novel 3 5 stars","1228":"dcover|isbn 978 0 06 208814 7a stunning debut reminiscent of the beloved novels of john hart and tom franklin a land more kind than home is a mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western north carolina town for a

lyle the town midwife and moral conscience and clem barfield a sheriff with his own painful past a land more kind than home is a haunting tale of courage in the face of cruelty and the power of love to overcome the darkness that lives in us all these are masterful portrayals written with assurance and truth and they show us the extraordinary promise of this remarkable first novel my review brothers jess and christopher are as close as any two siblings can be christopher is the oldest but is a deaf mute whom everyone has nicknamed stump always in trouble for spying on adults christopher once again does some spying and sees something that was not meant for eyes of his age throwing him into confusion full of turmoil and angst the town minister pastor chambliss believes in preaching with rattlesnakes and having the congregation prove their love faith and trust in god by handling these snakes without fear of being bitten until one day just that happens however he manages to convince his congregants that the lord just happened to call one miss molly jameson home to glory that very day it was during one of pastor chambliss's services that he convinced christopher's mother that he could provide a 'healing' for his lack of speech that something terrible happened leading to the heart pounding conclusion to the story along with what jess and christopher saw that last day they were spying on their momma and daddy the town midwife the lovely old miss adelaide had long taken the children out of the church and was holding sunday services at her home for them as she didn't trust chambliss and all his goings on at the church the author did an excellent job at conveying to the reader the emotions that people show when they're riled up and in the spirit of the moment and how things can be over looked when caught up in the emotion packed moment of loud music hand clapping and rattlesnakes a family is shattered a town has hung its head in shame and a lot of healing needs to take place in this small town of marshall north carolina for a debut novel wiley cash has written a book that grabs you pulls you and doesn't release its grip until the very unexpected end i'll be looking for more of this authors work and recommending this novel to my friends","1229":"what a great find this was a great story well told","1230":"his writing style is a combination of lee smith and ron rash all of the characters are disturbed this novel had a great ending i would recommend","1231":"i wasn't sure i would like this book when i read about it i really enjoyed the story the characters and the way it is so beautifully written it is sad yet hopeful scary yet comforting the story is told from the viewpoint of three separate characters which blend the storyline and draw the ending to it's violent yet redemptive closure this is a book i will recommend to many and i will look for more from this new author","1232":"beautifully written story","1233":"i was torn between 3 and 4 stars i am always happy when a book like this comes out it's southern gothic proclaim readers everywhere yes it fits neatly with its setting alternating pov and of course the grotesque a burnt up evil pastor mountain folks with a bunch of brylcreem in their hair it definitely reminds me of john hart's work but i got the feeling that this novel would be more literary than contemporary novels in its class then i changed my mind after i read the first chapter which is super but it's like tv on the page now i think sadly that southern gothic is dead cash didn't kill it just emulates it and anything that comes after o'connor capote mccullers faulkner and tyler is just derivative cash's command of language and voice is impressive and it was a worthwhile read he is totally worthy of the praise on his dust jacket but what's that saying great fiction is surprising this is not","1234":"i liked this book very different from what i would normally choose but it kept me interested even though it had a little religious factor to it loved the way the author used the characters words to bring their accent through it was like i could hear them saying it definitely helps making the characters feel more real","1235":"i could not put this book down which at times was problematic because it meant staying up late into the night sobbing something about this story really grabbed me pulling me into its haunting southern setting it felt real which is always a good thing in a book but maybe not when it's so devastating","1236":"as the cover says it much like to kill a mockingbird but still a new story and a good read it reminded me very much of the story of edgar sawtelle","1237":"i'll give cash this he definitely has a terrific unique voice and writing style but this book was just so damn bleak it reminded me of crooked letter crooked letter but bleaker and that book was no picnic i enjoyed the triumvirate narrators which broke up the story even though i didn't love adelaide i respected cash having three separate and distinct voices for her 8 year old jess and 60 ish sheriff clem the story is beautifully written very southern and gothic the bad guy seemed extra bad to me and i always wish my fiction bad guys were more nuanced but frankly some people in real life are just awful so i'll accept it i thought the pacing was very good the characters believable and the writing lovely i can't say that it really resonated with me but it was definitely a great book club choice lots to discuss it was overwhelmingly liked in our little circle i think cash is a real talent and i've heard his next book is terrific too","1238":"i read this avidly and thought it was well written and compelling and provocative","1239":"i won this in a goodreads giveaway and although the story itself was quite disturbing it was beautifully written and honestly told a wonderful debut novel","1240":"let me just preface my review by telling you that the only reason i read this book was because it was chosen by the book club i just joined i joined the book club because i thought it would be a great opportunity to read books i ordinarily wouldn't read a land more kind than home definitely qualifies in that regard anything to do with religious fanaticism drives me absolutely crazy two pages in i almost bailed but i had to know what came next the writing is compelling strong and lyrical though sometimes the descriptions are a little too long winded this is a story of the power of faith community responsibility family secrets marriage and infidelity told in three voices jess a sweet innocent ten year old who wants to protect his mute brother stump adelaide the town midwife who tries to protect the children from pastor chambliss a man who cares for nothing but his own pleasures who uses the ignorance of his flock to get what he wants and clem the town sheriff who has his own burdens to bear despite the efforts of jess and the old lady to protect stump and the love of his father and mother things go awry for the boy","1241":"a slow start but very good book about different ways of healing","1242":"beautiful and tragicthree characters' perspectives young boy jess whose mute older brother stump dies midwife sheriff","1243":" i loved the title which is from a line in thomas wolfe's you can't go home again i started out liking this book but i didn't finish it because the author betrayed his character so badly that the spell was broken and there was no reason to continue to wit the story is set in a backwater town in north carolina about 50 years back a mute 13 year old boy accidentally witnesses his mother and the preacher in bed together the preacher sees him but the mother doesn't the preacher forces the boy to church the next sunday and proceeds to lay hands on him to cure him of his condition this particular action consists of the preacher wrestling him to the ground and a bunch of guys helping the preacher by forming a human pile up which almost smothers the child who is kicking and flailing the mother thinking she heard the boy speak determines to bring him back to church that very evening for the 2nd service the boy goes to church and dies that night did the boy go willingly did he struggle against his mother does he try to run away does he pitch a fit throw a tantrum or otherwise express any hesitation about going into the church that second time after his ordeal that morning if so it happens offstage and the reader never hears a word of it so i couldn't keep reading because i felt that i had been lead over a cliff not by the death but by the lack of explanation for the character's motivation the story expired for me like a popped balloon","1244":"being a southern girl i can appreciate the slow pace of this book even though it takes a while to really get interesting the brothers personalities ring true to how little boys living in a small southern town would be i would liked to have known a little more about chambliss but i think the characters of adelaide and the sheriff were fleshed out just enough to make them interesting without being over done","1245":"great story","1246":"i was hooked from the first chapter i love it when an author can do that such a great book","1247":"superb storytelling full of rich characters","1248":"i wanted to like this book more than i did it was a good story and the ending was very strong but the dialect southern idiom got to be a bit much and the villain was a bit too much of a baddie to be believable still i enjoyed it as a good summer read","1249":"very well written for a first novel interesting story told from three main characters about an appalachian v","1250":" a land more king than home wiley cash a north carolina modern dayfirst line i sat there in the car with the gravel dust blowing across the parking lot and saw the place for what it was not what it was right at that moment in the hot sunlight but for what it had been maybe twelve or fifteen years before a real general store with folks gathered around the lunch counter a line of people at the soda fountain little children ordering ice cream of just about every flavor you could think of hard candy by the quarter pound moon pies and crackerjack and other things i hadn't thought about tasting in years this isn't technically a mystery although there is an illegal death it is one of the most beautiful books i've read in a long time and as haunting in its way as the road told by four narrators the basic story is how and why a young mute boy comes to die but it is so much more than that a story of evil and redemption inevitability and free will it is hard to believe that this is a first novel","1251":"very atmospheric with a strong sense of place a really good first novel interesting to read in the endnote that it was inspired by a real event and how the author transformed the original story","1252":"a dark book religion can be uplifting beautiful and spiritually gratifying but not always when it used to manipulate control scare and blackmail it turns into something very ugly very fast this book was scary and also so heart wrenching it was difficult to read most of the subject matter was just so heavy yet i kept turning the pages i wanted to throw the book against the wall at times because it made me so angry but i had to know what happened a land more kind than home was filled with the ugliest type of violence it scared the shit out of me and made me deeply sad at times i could not stop reading this wiley cash is a wonderful storyteller and if you like rural noir or southern gothic noir type books you will probably enjoy this read salvation on sand mountain also it will give you some background perspective on the snake handling style of christianity and another manipulative real life pastor involved in this mysterious style of worship this is some southern lit at its best but it will take you down a very dark road","1253":"in his startling debut novel wiley cash explores the backwoods mountain country of north carolina and allows an eccentric cast of characters to do the talking including one of the most memorable villains i've met this year an ex meth cooker turned charismatic pastor a land more kind than home is the story of two brothers jess and stump hall whose mother is under the spell of a fanatical snake handling pastor in many ways this is a timeless tale of good vs evil forgiveness and revenge redemption and self destruction reminiscent of--but not quite the same caliber as--larry brown's novel father and son which is a great compliment a land more kind than home has three narrators--adelaide lyle an elderly woman who is more culpable for what happens throughout the novel than perhaps she believes which strips her last section in the novel of its power in my opinion because she doesn't own up to her own guilt and the town's guilt for not speaking up against zealotry jess hall the nine year old brother of stump and son of julie and ben and sheriff clem barefield a man who has his own troubles with forgiveness and an itchy trigger finger although at times its narrative voices sound a little too similar although its last page for some reason really pissed me off a land more kind than home is a must read southern novel from a novelist i'll be keeping my good eye on","1254":" this was wonderful best thing i have read by an nc author in a long time you would be wrong to compare wiley cash to john hart hart is a writer and cash is a storyteller cash created a great sense of suspense in a very subtle even handed way excellent character development told through reflections of the characters my only disappointment is i felt like it got a little unnecessarily preachy right at the end cash should have more faith in his writing and readers i cannot wait to read more from this new author","1255":"good book fast moving and kind of sad but i think that was the point good read","1256":"i spent my summers growing up near the region where this lovely literary novel takes place mr cash transported me back to the place i love most the exposition teases every sense in this magnificent rich tale told in the first person voice of three heart wrenching characters i won't soon forget well done indeed highly recommended","1257":"3 5 stars it's a sad story","1258":"a land more kind than home is the type of book that brings a lot of hype to the table but fizzles once the reader gets half way through the book cash's writing is rightfully compared to that of hemingway but he has a long way to go before he can really put his name up in the same bookshelf as that type of world renowned writer i was able to get a copy of the book from my local library and began reading it almost immediately the premise of the story would keep any reader interested but it was not fully explored so i was left wondering why this book is getting such rave reviews the story is told from several different point of views which is a popular way of writing these days but i think that this method was used because it is extremely difficult for cash to completely understand his characters' feelings actions and thoughts the book would have been much better had he chosen to focus more of the character's actions rather then their interaction with each other is the book a mystery spiritual novel or a southern novel it is hard to tell because the story line and the cirucmstances that unfold to revel the conflict never were fully explained or resolved the ending was also disapointing it could have left the reader wanting to know more about what continues to take place after all the characters die but unfortunately it just continues to limp off into the end credits shallow characters undeveloped plot line loose conflicts no setting and a novel that lacks all the things that people are raving about wiley cash must be someone special in person for all of these reviewers to love his novel as much as they do i simply was not sold moving along","1259":"another excellent dark southern first novel this story revolves around a nine year old boy in the mountains of western north carolina and the sinister influence of a snake handling preacher i really can't say much more without giving too much away but this is well written and true to the mountain land and people i know well","1260":"wow another good story and well told","1261":"a decent read although i kept thinking the prose seemed like a draft taken straight from a writing workshop that is all description minute detail hardly any analysis or introspection the style worked when the pov was from the 9 year old child jess but i wanted more from the adult characters more could have been done with jess's character the set up is excellent i won't give it away but suffice it to say i thought the child would have felt much more responsible for what happened and this never really manifests","1262":"a small town's way of life is disrupted when a mute child is killed during a healing by a preacher of questionable intentions reminiscent of a justified episode without the magnetism of boyd and raylan oh how i missed them i don't say this often but this book could've been longer i wanted to know more about the sheriff adelaide the midwife and julie the mother of stump and jess and what made clem so shady give to readers who are entranced by this setting the most excellent once upon a river","1263":"creepy snake handling but we'll written","1264":"outstanding southern fiction from a hot new author on the publishing scene","1265":"love the setting the flawed characters the thrilling pace and that redemption is still up for grabs","1266":"great book gives you a real feel of life in a small community and the effect religion has on everyone regardless of their belief","1267":"well written and engaging i felt a bit dissatisfied at the end i would have liked to have a couple of the main players in the tale be more delineated","1268":"shit was basic","1269":"this book uses the snake handlers religion of the small group who practice this perverted type of worship in a pretty expected way somebody dies the setting and the story seem as if they could occur in this rural area the story is interesting but i found that once i left the book it was hard to recall the seminal events few books really make an impact this was not one of them however it was a good read and put together well","1270":"an amazing debut novel a story of opposites good and evil hope the author writes a few more novels","1271":" make no mistake wiley cash is the next rick bragg this author's name will be reknown in no time he has all the heart depth and skill of bragg and the same southern roots i purchased this book because of the outstaning reviews it is receiving understandable but also because cash and i share the same locale of origin a small town in western north carolina this book is set in that area and confronts one of its scariest challenges cash has an incredible way of getting into his character's heads and hearts this was a page turner i look forward to his next book and his assured success","1272":"to much craziness for me but i still wanted to know what would happen in the end poor kid had a rough go of life","1273":"immensely engrossing although the story is hard to read at times you find yourself yelling out loud to the characters of course they don't listen making it a very sad story so well written you won't put it down it's story of people that are so hungry for hope that they're willing to make horrible sacrifices to get there if they get there","1274":" this book doesn't hold many surprises as cash hews close to the book's genre roots but to very good effect the story is well crafted and cash manages to sustain the tension through the very end even though you know exactly what will happen i have some minor complaints about some of the character development i still don't have a very good sense of why ben and julie grew apart and i wish we met more of the congregation or others who have stayed away from the church which would paint a fuller picture of chambliss's hold on the community but in all a great and quick read especially on a sick day i may try to tackle thomas wolfe's you can't go home again but maybe not until i have some uninterrupted time say if i catch the flu this season now back to our regularly scheduled mars themed programming","1275":"i won this book in a goodreads giveaway review this book definitely wasn't what i expected but it was interesting nonetheless i'm only giving it three stars because its similar to previous books i've read with the whole church is more like a cult though i wasn't expecting the shootout at the end i don't usually like books that are told in multiple points of view because it doesn't flow read well but i thought it actually worked for this novel","1276":"i can't say that i enjoyed this one per say as i found it to be a rather heartwrenching read but the writing a debut wowed me so i can say two thumbs up","1277":"i love cash's writing you think about other books that you enjoy and reflecting back they feel like well developed outlines of stories this story is rich full of substance and sensual it ended too soon i wanted more","1278":"read this straight through in one night excellent","1279":"this is a lovely engaging read great great debut novel by wiley cash more later if i get the energy","1280":"i really liked this book i thought it was so good it hooked my interest right away i'd like to read another of his books","1281":"a prolific first novel lyrical and absorbing","1282":" a very engaging book told through the eyes of three characters jess a nine year old boy adelaide lyle an elderly woman and the town midwife and clem barefield the sheriff there are some bad things happening in this remote town marshall jess helps to protect his older brother christopher who goes by stump he is a mute stump sees something he should not have seen the results of this become tragic adelaide has also witnessed some evil cruel events in this town especially at the church she is protective of the children there the sheriff clem has his own tragic past all three character are entwined in each other's life i found myself having a hard time putting this book down it kept me curious to know what happens in the end","1283":"this novel set in north carolina is a fast paced morality tale its three narrators cover three generations the character development in this novel is superb it features lush lyrical lovely prose i was happy that the beautiful title was part of the epigraph so i got it right away i also really liked its lack of a traditional happy ending","1284":"was an awesome book explained the ways of life in rural north carolina this first ever book published by this author is a hit","1285":"i don't recall how i came across this one but it proved enjoyable a high 3 low 4 for me a coming of age story embedded in an appalachian hillbilly gothic noir there was no mystery as to the identity of the bad guy just in how it would all play out despite multiple narrators and time lines the author avoided unnecessary confusion which easily occurs in such construction","1286":"lyrically readable sensuos southern gothic with a laid back laconic feel adrift in the mountains","1287":"this haunting story is set in the north carolina mountains the writer used beautiful prose and incredibly detailed descriptions to paint characters and scenery that seemed too real to be fiction beautiful book","1288":"this was a great book can't wait for the next book to come out","1289":"i really really wanted to love this book it sounded like the perfect summer novel southern gothic small town corrupt preacher young boy who sees too much just the premise had me imagining late nights unable to put this book down unfortunately it failed to live up to my own excitement to describe this story as a slow boil would be an understatement the pace was so slow it seemed to forget it was building to something and then it completely wandered away from the story halfway through to explore in depth the seemingly irrelevant past of one of the characters the writing was good i like the characters and the story had enormous potential it just never quite lived up to it for me this book was much slower quieter and less intense than i had imagined it and so for me it was ultimately disappointing had i gone in with fewer expectations i may have found this a more surprising and compelling read","1290":"this was beautifully written essentially a greek tragedy in the inexorable nature of the story the characters are well drawn and it gave me a wonderful sense of the place in which it's set you can tell that the author knows this place and loves it i can't wait to see what else he writes","1291":"loved it the author draws you in with an inexorable pull an undertow of menace and creates a sense of place so strong that you can practically smell the tobacco on the breeze","1292":"i wish i had read this with a group of people lots of fodder for discussion i loved the north carolina setting well done in my view as one who lives there i loved the conviction of the characters and the motivations behind them i loved the child's perspective and mr cash knows how to extract emotions from heart wrenching situations on the page the male characters were crisply drawn the plot well balanced","1293":"this is an extraordinary book knowing that it is also a debut novel is astonishing and exciting with the promise of so much more to come the diverse characters in this novel were as real as they ever get the snow and the rain made me feel like i needed gloves and boots on i could not put it down but dreaded what was to come you have set the bar very high can't wait to see what comes next","1294":"i am not someone that loves the books with the happy perfect endings but i am not sure there was even one moment of happiness in this whole book thoroughly depressing going to need to find some sort of comedy to read after that","1295":"about rural north carolina religion and snakes nicely done","1296":"intriguing book draws a person in told by 3 characters the story of a small appalachian town where a snake handling preacher reigns over a church add a couple of young barely teen boys who like to dare one another to 'spy' on what they should not see and the result is a good read written well easy to read draws the reader into the story","1297":"this book was extremely well written it's told from the pov of three characters and you really get to know each one although if you're looking for a happy book don't pick this one up my only issue with the book was the end which i felt was a little rushed and forced","1298":"awesome story for a new author and first book excellent can't stop reading tale it will make you cringe cry chuckle and stay with you long after the last page for those who wonder the story touches on a form of religion but doesn't promote there are good and evil in all things i hope the next stories from wiley cash will be just as good or even better","1299":"strong characters that stay with you their voices distinctly tell their part in the drama and how their pasts shaped them to get to this point beautifully written debut novel anticipating reading wiley cash's second novel","1300":"this is seriously one of the best books i've ever read the pacing was superb and it sucked me in from the very first page it was heartbreaking mesmerizing and just plain fantastic i have not been this excited about a first novel in years i will be encouraging all my friends to pick it up","1301":" excellent story bordering on mythology i loved the way cash would spend time elaborating on details most authors skip right on by the stormy skies the sweat on a boys legs the feel of old wood in his hands the way broken glass glitters on the floor if you have spent any time in the appalachia area you will connect with this story i admit i was hugely disappointed in the ending i wanted jess to give me the last word but he did not my last contact with him is through the observation of a bystander i feel cheated since i had become so invested in this character an excellent debut novel","1302":" dark and enigmatic a land more kind than home had me captivated from its opening pages as soon as i heard adelaide lyle speak i knew that wiley cash was a talent to be reckoned with the voices of the three narrators the author uses to tell this story--adelaide being my personal favorite--are so hauntingly authentic and vividly rendered that i was immediately reminded of faulkner yes that is high praise but it is also due praise as it is a rare talent that can so perfectly evoke a character or a place a beautiful but heartwrenching book","1303":"disappointing as i began this book i thought it had real potential the plot line had potential to be interesting i mean what's not interesting about people who decide to risk their lives playing with poisonous snakes but fell terribly short it seemed very two dimensional to me a bit like watching a lifetime movie predictable and a little depressing i had a hard time finding the motivation to finish this one","1304":" i was dying to get into this book i received a copy of a land more kind than home through first reads right before leaving on a spring break road trip i brought it along but that was just too optimistic the moment we got home i dove in and couldn't put it down until it was finished around 2 30 a m the story takes place in the mid 1980's but it had a much older vibe to it as cash shared backstories for some of the characters time jumped all around the 20th century but it did so without being complicated it was almost as though the story happened across all of those times probably because it could have people are people no matter what the decade the events are told from three different points of view and cash grabs our attention from the very first page each narrator has their own voice and i think cash has done a good job of separating them we first hear from adelaide the midwife who delivered most the population of marshall she's an old woman but strong and determined it's a treat later to discover her own story and how she became the woman she is adelaide has decided to walk away from her church though she believes her church has moved away from her and what it once was it's been hijacked by a charismatic preacher and addy doesn't like his methods jess hall is only nine when we meet him he has a 13 year old younger brother stump who doesn't speak jess looks out for stump until he can't both boys see and hear more than any boy should and they find themselves caught up in the circumstances created by the adults around them jess is a bright and innocent boy who carries a much bigger burden than he ought to have been given and he understands more than anyone thinks he does the sheriff clem has his own story though he's new to the area only having lived there for over 20 years his history is tangled up with town's nonetheless he's lived through his own heartbreak and his current case brings it all back he's been suspicious of pastor chambliss for quite some time he knows something isn't right but hadn't had cause to pursue it until now the rest of the characters are well written some are very well developed while others are barely there just popping up when needed those who we care to know we do and that's all that matters we see in them the strength and the flaws just like we do in life the one character that we feel no amount of sympathy for is carson chambliss from the moment i heard his name i had a bad feeling which became a whole host of negative feelings as the story moved on yet he seemed as real to me as the other characters there are plenty of people in the world who's motives are only for themselves ready to prey on anyone's trust ultimately this book reminds that good will overcome but that things can get pretty messy along the way and that we should always be examining what motivates us do we rely too heavily on someone when we ought to pay more attention to what we know is right if you like a well told story then you might want to pick up this book","1305":" i found this book absolutely captivating i just couldn't put it down i think the author really captured the atmosphere of a small southern town perfectly it felt authentic i also had such a strong response to so many of the characters both wonderful and horrible i adored jess stump addie and clem i was rooting for them and found myself practically holding my breath during some of the scenes because i was so worried for them i also know a character has been well written when i am overcome by rage by their actions julie inspired this in me and i almost said out loud at the pool oh you are killing me julie how could you i was also filled with dread at the thought that chambliss might not pay for his actions i was fully invested in him being brought to justice even the secondary characters in the book were well fleshed out and i cared about them and appreciated what they brought to the table even though i had a pretty good idea where things were headed i was on the edge of my seat as the tension built and the story played out i am still a bit anxious thinking about jess and how things ended for him that's how real these people seemed to me it was a great read","1306":"i was completely consumed by this story wiley cash has an incredible writing story especially considering he was writing in three such strong narratives this terrifying story was made even more disturbing when it was revealed that it was based true events","1307":"i liked how the book was told from three different perspectives however i found it a little frustrating that each character would start telling you about the main plot of the story and then revert to a flashback and sometimes it took me out of the story","1308":"told in three distinct voices this story tells a story of interwoven lives and the frailties desires and hubris of the inhabitants of an isolated mountain area of nc worth reading","1309":"it's been a long time since i couldn't put down a book but thanks to wiley cash that dry spell is broken","1310":"couldn't put this one down amazing first novel","1311":"set in a rural town in north carolina this remarkable debut novel is about two brothers their family and neighbors it revolves around incidents at the local church where the pastor professes healing and uses snake handling the word \"evil\" could accurately be used it is riveting and very well written","1312":"i don't give many books 5 stars but wiley cash's debut deserved all five of them from the first page of this book i was hooked beautifully written it's told through the voices of three characters a young boy an elderly woman and the town sheriff cash did a great job of moving the story from the present to the past and back again some of the reviews said the plot moved too slowly but for me the pace was pitch perfect and his characters jumped off the page i was sorry when the story ended i highly recommend this book","1313":" set in north carolina a land more kind than home tells the story of a small tight knit community and the evil that visits them in the form of the church and religion the story is told from three perspectives adelaide lyle the town midwife clem barefield the local sheriff and jess hall the young boy whose family is central to the story this is an impressive well written debut from wiley cash cash has the ability to create a very atmospheric and haunting setting there were some beautiful symbolic descriptions of the town the weather and the surrounding beauty of nature which added to the overall atmosphere and which allow us to really visualise the small town in north carolina i liked how the story was told from all three perspectives adelaide was a strong and wise woman who stood up for her own beliefs clem too was a very likeable solid character who had also suffered his own tragedy the chapters from jess were probably my most favourite told in a very childlike innocent yet charming manner we really felt everything jess himself was feeling through his innermost thoughts my heart really went out to him this is a very sad story and reminds us how evil under the veil of religion can capture and almost brainwash a whole community and subsequently how a community will turn a blind eye even to murder in the name of religion","1314":"loved this first time novel by wiley cash who i am certain we will see many more good books from beautifully written about the coming of age and bond between two brothers the setting is in a small town in n c which is gripped by a fanatical preacher who misguides the community it is a story rich in characters evil tragedy love forgiveness and loss i could not put this book down loved it","1315":"this is the first novel by cash and it definitely reminds me of the terrific books of award winners john hart and tom franklin i enjoyed the book and believe i've found another award winner in cash the story is expertly told by three characters an 8 year old boy an old woman and an experienced older sherif the themes of survivors rather than victims love from many angles and small town involvement in everyone's lives is written beautifully the mystery is slyly slipped in the compelling first person narratives a real winner for me","1316":"great book fast read hard to believe it is the author's first novel sad compelling story","1317":"i was a little confused at first but i really enjoyed the story and how it's told through different perspectives","1318":"i loved the way this book was written i found the culture and characters fascinating the plot is very interesting and well rounded it was an interesting read so why the 3 stars i cannot handle fiction books that are so gruesome and extraordinarily depressing the main character jess a 9 year old boy is darling but i wish that the author had given him a little more hope or happiness in the end it was a very shocking heart wrenching book but a great discussion book","1319":"i listened to this on audible not only does the story capture a sense of place but the narrators do an excellent job of bringing it to life the story held me from the very beginning there is much to think about and discuss the role of religion the complicated relationships between fathers and sons the pressures that life deals marriage and what loss does and doesn't do to us i highly recommend","1320":"although this book is well written and i do like books written in the first person this one seemed somewhat slow and choppy it may be that i have read too many in this genre in the last few months","1321":"i picked up this book in am effort to support a fellow alum i must say it surprised me i was pleased with his rich details of scenery and his endearing characters i did have issues getting past first few chapters only because i'm not too keen on snakes this book touches on several issues of life such as childhood hurts the difference between spirituality and religion and the courage to speak up","1322":"this is really well written and the plot and characters make sense 99% of the time plus how can you go wrong with scarey church snake handlers","1323":"this story was engaging and held my interest i felt the story meandered when the narrator would tell a tidbit about the past but overall i would recommend it","1324":" this book made me angry and made me cry angry because of organized religion and holier than thou church leaders on a power trip angry at the congregation for believing without reading for themselves really angry at julie for letting them do what they did to christopher all because she was weak putting her faith in a man the ending made me cry because jess was left without parents this was a haunting story and will stay with me for a long time but i will always feel sad and angry when i think about it i listened to the audio version and the people reading were wonderful i hate when i listen to a southern book and the person reading isn't from the south and tries to talk like we do this was not the case i felt like i was listening to people i know talk spot on","1325":"a really good read with lots of truths about religion and how it can ruin people","1326":" i thought the subject matter was interesting it's about one of those crazy religious groups that uses snakes in worship very secretive group and mind controlling the story is about the strange pastor and a devoted woman who brings her son to a healing session and the boy dies it's written from various perspectives by chapter it was an easy read but pretty sad ending i wonder if i missed something greater and perhaps if it were a book club read my friends would enlighten me i may suggest it for this fall for our group","1327":"dark brooding tragic a tragedy of a child's death told from three different perspectives the brother the church lady and the cop one of the few books where the chrater's flaws don't bring much by way of redemption that i actually ended up liking sometime we just live with our downfalls","1328":"jess hall and his older autistic brother stump become the victims of their mother's snake handling church","1329":"a singular story in several respects the story is told from the viewpoint if the main characters events unfold in real time and the characters tell their story concurrently and each character is written so well they come alive in the reading the author has a powerful grasp on setting a tone and scene with a few well chosen words or a phrase the reader is a part of the community for awhile as if they were sharing news with the characters over a cup of coffee i would read anything by wiley cash","1330":"good read would be interesting for a book club liked how the story is told from different character perspectives","1331":"a good attempt for a first novel however the characters and their lives are so predictable the dialog becomes tangled with small stories that the author delves into to give
